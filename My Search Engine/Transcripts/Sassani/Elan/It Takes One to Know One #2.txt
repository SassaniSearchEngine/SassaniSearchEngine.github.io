 Oh why not hey? Continue sitting. Hey. You were saying before what powerful creators we are? Hey. Could I create something like say I wanted to be this incredible singer? Well first of all perhaps a credible singer would be a more popular. What the idea is that you are attracted to that symbol to the point where you are excited about that excitement in and of itself tells you that that thing is available to you. Now when you assume that it is not and have the belief that it is not an act that way you get the evidence of that idea but that evidence is the result of the action again according to the belief. So if you truly understand that there is nothing extra in creation that all that is and you do not create to tease yourself and understand that that excitement is a direct indication that it is available your actions will become different and you will in that sense perhaps assess your level of ability and then begin to increase that level of ability through choice and preference by attracting whatever symbol will allow you to begin to expand on that event. So it is completely do as you said. Thank you. Oh thank you. Is that all? Mm-hmm. Oh. Shut it. Oh yeah. And to you. Good day. When you were thinking about time why is human beings doing time in the classroom? Well in a sense it is not necessarily a classroom but a statement part and parcel of the way that you are choosing to relate to yourself and the idea is basically this. As you are more integrated and things are not so much separated from you your experience and creation of time will seem to decrease you create less time. Time quote unquote flies by but as you explore separation and seeing things as if separate from you and creating literally space between the portions of yourself you then necessitate the creation of more time to traverse that space to explore all the different separations. So as you act in a separate way you in that sense create more time which in that sense is perceived by you as time dragging by but as you express who you are and in that sense begin to express integration and create less space and therefore less need for time to traverse that space you create less space and again the efficiency or the perception is that time is flying by as we have shared when you are having fun you are being who you truly wish to be therefore literally creating less time and if you experience what you perceive to be fifteen minutes and look at the clock in two hours at that only has your physical body age the fifteen minutes you have created time in a different flow in comparison with the agreed upon creation of time flowing your reality not literally simply miss some of the time you literally created less of it and therefore your body experience only the amount of time that your consciousness creates you need not look at it as a track or a classroom but simply an expression of parameter that you are choosing to explore through and again part and parcel of the idea of the exploration of time is the exploration of unfoldment along the timeline what you refer to as timing and there are advantages complete unique advantages in the timing when you look at it that way but when you forsake the timing and in general are not allowing yourself to remain focused in what is available then you create more time so therefore it is quite up to you does that make sense Ella? I think I need time so I just that well you create time to digest and that is the point however in this particular instance the process that you will create of digesting it will open many doors within it for it again puts it back into your lap that you literally create that time is a statement is a creation and it's created by you the flow of which is determined by your willingness to again be integrated through to yourself expressing who you are or separated running around hiding from yourself hiding different portions from yourself denying and putting things in your subconscious closet once again the more separation through denial that you create the more time obviously that you need to create to address all these separations and so on and so forth does that make more sense so therefore be yourself choose in any given moment from whatever is available the thing that excites you the most that you can act on with integrity you will create the least amount of time necessary to be who you are and things will continuously seem to be forthcoming and things will seemingly continuously reflect preference rather than lack of preference and again if you are being who you are the result is creating less time if you are being completely mindful of what everyone else says you should be or should do you create more time to look at that. I have another question on reincarnation. Is reincarnation linear and do you would when a person visits a country or a place that is born is that a desire to go back to a place where one has to live. In that life is relevant to what you are exploring in this life so perhaps yes many times what you are attracted to in your imagination and errors of history that appeal to you generally do so for you have led life in those periods that are again relevant to the exploration that you are leading now but in terms of the linear arity of reincarnation this is again somewhat of an arbitrary question from the viewpoint of your physical self it is linear you had lives before are living now during and after will live other lives from that point of view it would seem to be linear but from the point of view of what you call your over soul or higher self everything is simultaneous there is no time it is all occurring right now so from that point of view you would not call it reincarnation implying a linear timeline but would call it multiple simultaneous incarnations for again from that perspective it is all going on at the same time so therefore when you tap into quote unquote a path line from your perspective you may seem to be tapping into something that happened but from the perspective of your higher self over soul or total consciousness you are actually having a bleed through from something else which is happening right now at the same time so again perhaps it is a confusing answer but yes and no depending upon the viewpoint oh thank you for that is that oh thank you I just want to ask a couple questions about your society with children are they born physiologically from the female at this time yes still are they born at home it will depend upon the timing perhaps not only we are a bit more spontaneous about it and create what you would call the birthing process with absolutely no semblance of pain or the idea is there is a direct and complete understanding and conscious agreement with the soul about to be born prior to conception prior to birth we are far more connected with each other in this way so therefore the whole expression is different and we do not sit around and limit our activity when the birth is imminent as you say we simply go about our business and we will find ourselves in exactly the perfect place for that particular expression okay so it is not in a hospital or anything else okay we do not have what you would call hospital or even what you would call doctors for that matter right where we no longer express the type of reality whereby we would create the need to give ourselves a blatant message that you call disease is simply you delivering yourself a message that you have refused to look at since again we are in full acknowledgement that simply does not exist any longer in our society when we had talked to you it said that the children they are the children of all the parents and the parents and all the children well that is the spirit that is the attitude there is not the possessive kind of idea there is acknowledgement of the physiological parents for again there was the purposefulness in choosing those particular parents however it is far looser in terms of that all adults are quote unquote able to be responding or respond able to all children and vice versa so there is a very community oriented feeling but still again and perhaps this will only translate through your language in a certain way but it is special perhaps kind of closeness to the physiological parents again this is not completely accurate there are limitations in your language for there is at the same time that you would proceed to be something special feel is complete equality and you have no word for this so the child is raised with that physiological parents to its their age or well not necessarily the child will find themselves at the age of three years to find themselves attracted to whatever individuals will enhance and enable them to enhance their own exploration whatever they are excited about they will immediately draw the individuals that will assist them in enhancing their knowledge and understanding of them perhaps you can say that there is a closer tie prior to the age of three to the physiological parents there is a vestigial remnant of that symbol but not so much anymore there is more of now of an energy exchange whereas you as a society are beginning to cross the threshold from a third dimension third density reality which is physical to a fourth density reality which is still physical but more expanded expression we are in that sense beginning to explore fifth density which would be non-physical and when you are quote unquote at the end of fourth one of the reflections that occurs is you begin to transform a reliance on any outer symbol so we are at that junction where these things are still possible to explore but they are less and less engaged upon as we begin to approach our non-physical being next in our history yes another thing thank you oh thank you another thing I want to ask you about was um I read that close communication and you're the shooter do you mean communion that's what serves a particular function and the function that serves is allowing individuals to look at that fear without having to attract that interaction to do so so you can begin to allow that fear once again instead of overwhelming you allow that fear to serve you what must I believe to be fearing that now also understand that the individual who wrote that book in experiencing what he experienced whether it be physical or allegorical was in fear was in victim mode so therefore his rendition is his interpretation through his own fear that something was happening to him and this is in general the people that seek the loudest and the individuals that your society hear about that interact with these beings however there are many individuals who have filed or interpreted these interactions since early childhood in a very private very special very perhaps exalted mode and they are quite comfortable with the interactions same exact interactions except their understanding and their willingness to acknowledge ideas to themselves have them experience it in a completely different way in a positive way you do not generally again hear from many of these individuals for they feel it to be a very special and private part of who they are you will however begin to hear about more and more of them that do interpret it in a positive way to begin to provide an alternate reflection however now you can use whatever fear you have to see what you must believe in those circumstances these individuals are merely only ever detained and never truly abducted in the truest form of that word abduction in that sense would generally imply not returning them well i think it just goes into my own history of insta-thats with having things inserted and things done against my will well the difference and again i will point out to you that none fundamentally none of the interactions take place against the ultimate will of the higher self of the individuals involved and on the higher self level there is agreement to co-create that reality for nothing can happen to you without on some level your agreement or consent when you begin to look at it as an exploration and glean what you can from it and then use the information and act according to preference it becomes a positive experience at least conceptually when you say oh poor me why me why is this happening to me why does it always happen to me you with the same exact circumstance create that negative effect but even in again your aforementioned own personal example on some level and i am not saying this in the form of blame at all but on some level you chose to have the strength to experience that so that you could understand certain things about yourself about human nature about physical reality about purpose rate orhood about victimhood that when you begin to get down to the business of greening how it has served you will make you the person that you say you prefer to be your or a person's denial of their choice in the matter whether it was conscious or unconscious again removes your ability to use the sin and simply makes you a victim by your own act so as you look at that issue and perhaps reread that book it will have a different impact and you will begin to be advising perhaps the author in other ways that he can look at it though that the dress what you are asking yes what is that all um and no the other thing i wanted to ask you was um when we had the interaction Wednesday night i had gone in and one of the things that i knew i wanted to do was to somehow just be be together for a span of time whatever i i don't understand it and um you had suggested for me to hold my hand and i realized i was listening to the tape playing back how i completely went against or not went against but just completely not acknowledged what i was being drawn to do so what i wanted to ask you is sometimes in meditation can i call to you and be they are and for whatever reason because i still don't understand it but i'm trusting us what is the question good thing can i call on you in a minute if i'm in a meditation and have you your presence there or whatever or what we do we have said that you always get but our presence will not tell you you should do this you should do that or say why did you do that and when you hear that that is your own voice added into the pot so to speak right right so therefore again again when we say our stream is available there are no conditions upon your accessing of it however it will always still be up to your sense of discernment to understand what is actually us and again as a guideline anything that we say will always be completely self-empowering we'll never criticize or judge anything that you have done and although we may provide alternatives we'll never say here is something better than what you are doing simply here is an alternative what you are doing is perfectly valid and obviously giving you the results of what you are doing with a perfect 100% reflection but perhaps you may wish to look at this as well that is the style that we communicate in we never say you dummy why did you do that it is not our side nor do we ever think of you as dumb as oh yes thank you as well mayo um okay i want to ask you about spirituality because it's something religion it's been hard for me i guess i i tend to look at it in a negative way there are built-in hypocrisy so much of it for it purports on the one hand to be the vehicle through which you will re-establish your connection with god and express that connection through the love of all people but on the other hand there is the built-in supposition that each religion is the only way and that all the other methods of connecting so to speak don't have the right to exist so that hypocrisy will hang many of you up now that you are beginning to openly explore your consciousness rather than simply following a wall in life-cheap so i i feel it's when i when i try to make a like a conscious contact with all that is or god is that just opening up myself or is that letting all that is in more to make me feel this positive energy oh good question now understand first of all one of the quote unquote perhaps miss understanding built-in to some of your religious ideas is that you need something to re-establish your connection with god for that idea in and of itself pre-supposes and is the belief which you then act like and get the effective that you can be separated from god and the idea is once again that you are an i spelled e y e as well as capital i and i of god itself you are separated and do not need to re-establish any connection simply acknowledge the connection you already have and can never lose you would simply cease to exist which is impossible where do you not an expression of all that is so the idea is yes you can connect with that and feel that but not again connect something outside it is simply expressing the all that is this expressing the godness that you already are through yourself and again that expression is completely unconditionally loving and in fact does not say this is the only way but says here is a way here is a way here is a way they are all valid the truth the ultimate truth is composed of all truths and if you leave but one of those truths out there is not a complete and ultimate truth it is the complete truth minus one truth but since the truth is composed of all truths it is a matter of you choosing which truth is attracted to you which truth is representative of who you are and then allowing everyone else to have their own truth just as well if you do not agree with their truth it is all right for them to still have it but you need not condone it by simply acting according to your own truth you condone someone else's truth when you act the same way well i'll show them i'll show them exactly how it feels when you treat people that way by treating them the exact way and then they can see what it feels like that attitude which actually winds up having you treat them the same way act the same way as them it's actually a form of condoning what they do your willingness to say all right they are acting this way it is all right it is their exploration but i do not choose or condone this i will act the way that i act and then showing them the different way to act is of service to them while validating their truth rather than invalidating if you validate someone's truth they will listen to you in general if you invalidate their truth they put up a defense and will not listen to any other truth so the idea is that you establish what your truth is be that truth feel that truth feel the all that is this throughout you and also be willing to validate someone else's reality and again if it is something negative without condoning it by acting the same way does that make sense yes um also that if when you become more in touch with yourself i use the term i guess awaken to the fact of your own consciousness and and of the fact of god are all that is do you feel that other people will feel this by your vibrations and you know feel your positive feelings if you're if you're letting yourself feel them you think other people will feel that also in general yes but the point is if you are truly doing this you will not worry about that and it will simply be automatic again this is where excitement enters into it the reason that you and anyone for that matter is excited about something is that that is your soul screaming to you in no uncertain terms this is most mean now we speak about excitement with integrity which takes into consideration that you do have enough power to create anything that you wish without harming yourself or someone else but that excitement is not extraneous it is not superfluous it is purpose it is perhaps you can say the all that isness within you knocking on the door saying well if the five things before you i am very excited about this thing that is what's telling you that that thing is most representative of who you are and beginning to function through your excitement act on that excitement with integrity and then create a result which is exciting create the vibration of excitement in your life and in fact when individuals ask what is my purpose in life that is the answer whatever excites you both overall and in any given moment is your purpose when you create this new momentum according to your excitement it is quite contagious quite infectious individuals see that it is actually possible to live a life of excitement and here is the example that is a very strong beacon a very strong example and will then usually yes generate the recognition in them that here is a person who really knows who they are and who expresses the unconditional love of all that is through them one more is that too simple no that's that sounds pretty perfect for you the idea is that it is that simple if you allow it to be but you can also make it as complex as it will take for you to convince yourself that it will work yeah that's it's simplicity is almost kind of for me difficult but one other thing well getting excited about the excitement itself is perhaps a place to begin for most if not all individuals are excited about the concept that your excitement could actually be your purpose in life and then individuals when beginning to entertain this notion say well i'll give it a shot i'll act on this thing that excites me with i and headwardy are always so amazed that the result is a completely wonderful happening in their life but this is how simple it is and as more individuals do so again they show people that this is possible for many individuals have the conception wealth it's impossible to be happy for i've never found anyone who is now also understand that when you say that you yourself are being the vibration of someone who is unhappy and will then generally only attract from what is available reflections of other individuals of like exploration but there are shall i say plenty of individuals out there who are actually happy and when you make the decision to function through your excitement and create that happiness within yourself they will seem to come out of the woodwork so you i believe in wondering if um changing your surroundings i just have i have a friend that he was talking to me about he wants to change himself by changing his surroundings and i was wondering if you believe also which it seems uh that you have to start with yourself because that's the only thing you really have control you have control of yourself and how you react ultimately when you change yourself everything else seems to change but individuals can make the decision to change and utilize that particular idea as a representation of that decision perhaps again putting themselves in circumstances that don't have the momentum of the circumstances in one place if the change and decision has actually first been made internally then it is possible to have the the external expression but if it is the form of running from your reality and bringing with you the negative notions they will appear in the new reality as well so fundamentally it does begin within but externally can be an expression of an internal decision so it will simply depend upon the clarity of that individual and again the idea of whether he's simply going towards something that is more representative of who he or she is or is running from something else quite a different orientation though the action may look the same thank you oh thank you and you be long hey uh male thank you bold one um do you know things about our planet through communication with us or other humans or from another means well okay there is created within the mentality of any channel that we come through certain the least that we in that sense to put it colloquially must work around and a very common belief of a channel is that we can only draw from what the channel has accumulated in vocabulary so in general we will express that our vocabulary is limited to the vocabulary of the channel however we have observed your planet not only through this means but also through other means so we have both accesses of information is there something specific you are seeking uh have you ever visited our planet or has anyone else ever visited our planet or been here are you thinking about of extra terrestrial origin yes whole absolute movement now we personally have not perhaps you can say set foot upon your planet though we have done flyby perhaps you can say that we're witnessed by many many individuals however there are at least two distinct races of other beings one that does not appear very humanish though is somewhat humanish and one that is almost entirely indiscernible from human that are physically landing upon your planet yes are we someone of a human experiment like we're there are sort of seeds dropped here well in one sense of the word but nobody's experiment now because you as a consciousness are parts of the designing of the experiment itself you are simply exploring your own exploration you are nobody's experiment okay one last question um will our societies ever become an union oh yes there is a high degree of likelihood and there is the possibility even within later on in this particular year of your time for your government to begin to release information that they have had for quite some time about the existence of at least one distinct extra terrestrial civilization what you have sometimes heard of as a cover up from our perspective is quite active okay i'm sorry i have one more it's all do not have to be solid it is our joy um um there is like monuments on the earth such as like stonehenge or pyramids or whatever and there's also been monuments such as a face on mars or other things are they connected hey very strong and you will find the structures on what you call to be mars when they are acknowledged fully to literally be perhaps you can say a postcard sent to yourselves many millennium ago that will open many doors within your individual consciousness but also within the mass idea of the acceptance of life in other places which is statistically a given like for example as i was watching the show they showed a front picture of a face on mars and they through computers they took one side of the face and folded it on the other and they showed the image of what the face would look like and it looked just like uh feline so they were trying to attribute that with the Sphinx on earth well to some degree there is a connection and you will also find what you call pyramidal structures to also be in that same position perhaps that will be more fascinating a discovery the pyramids of moths they've also said the tetrahedron the pyramids can be put in inside the earth as inside a circle if you put the point on the south pole or something and they did this with the earth all mathematically at another point the other the other point at the pyramid there was the volcano that's current that's always erupting in hawaii i don't know not the point is that there are particular latitudes from what you would call your equator both up and down approximately 19.5 degree which will represent very strong lines of electromagnetics flow and many of these structures will be found on many of the societies that have them to be placed along these particular latitudes to harness and to enhance this effect thank you very much oh thank you my brother has asked me to ask you what in the world is happening to him well perhaps part of the situation that he is creating is asking everyone else now we have discussed this so i will keep it brief doing what excites you the most is only half or perhaps in many cases less than half of what we are discussing doing what excites you the most with integrity is the entire picture enough power to do what you wish to do without harming yourself or someone else in full recognition that everything is all one thing one integrated hole integrity as an integration not as in moral standards which are arbitrary and ever changing if you factor out the integrity for any reason using any rationalization you will get certain effects and what we are perceived he is acting are the effects of that now we are not in any way blaming or chastising him simply answering in the most direct way that we can find possible he believes he is acting in accordance with messages he is getting from somewhere and yet it is rather obvious that the result is that he is going through one crisis every day at least it seems to me any source that he is attributing that information comes from is only as good as the effects that that source creates and if it is again the urging of the excitement without the integrity it is simply not a source that we would suggest listening to it is not that because the source is there you must list obviously you have many different television channels it is where you tune the dial that your attention falls it would be in a sense ridiculous and inaccurate to say if you turn to one channel all the rest of the channels aren't there they are you are simply tuning to that particular station he is tuning to a particular station if he does not like the effect that he is getting simply use his sense of discernment as the dial he is sure getting a lot of feedback from his behavior that tells him he is listening to allow the station all right but he is the only one that can determine and again it is not allowed the station it is a perfect reflection of a negative station perfect but the idea is what is it he wishes to create what is it he wishes to express does he wish to express integrity does he wish to experience integrity my particular understanding is that the answer is yes and you can only experience something if that is what you are willing to put out so simply review your own or his own idea of what integrity is and always factor that in and this something is very exciting and very accessible but he knows that acting upon it will not be within his full integrity then that is not one of the choices for the news is turning him that is on the more shall I say positive China he thinks what he's doing is treating people very well I disagree with him but the results well the idea is this in general due to the feedback that you create in your society if you are treating individuals well they will tell you some if you are willing to be open if individuals are telling you I am not getting that from you then that is opportunity to assess and then either decide to continue to treat people that way or not but part of the feedback of integrity will be the feedback from the individuals and if someone is saying I feel harmed by you even though technically they create their own version of it the point is that he is not expressing his power to the degree where it is not harming himself or someone else I see him trying to buy love affection and loyalty through material listing gifts well that will only give a temporary material to the sick of that give me some good feedback thank you very much oh thank you and thank him sure I think having what I think is energy it comes in forms of like blue dots every once in a while when I'm relaxed and what I'm asking is like is that what this is a positive I perceive it as a positive energy maybe wanting to communicate well from the sound of your voice so to speak there is also other connotations of how you are interpreting now my particular understanding again is that you expand your consciousness your physical senses begin to be more sensitive to things which were not generally in the range of your perception or expansion means expansion in the range of perception as well so if you are simply willing to enjoy the life show from that perspective you will get a positive result it is where you judge it that you get the negative result it is the judgment itself do you wish for them to see no more than have a good time okay is that okay I think over there you mentioned there was an embrace that it's one are endurance and more to our planet what is the purpose to be well one of the ideas is that perhaps you can say and this is only in the linear sense from your point of view that they are ancient brothers sisters and cousins to the overall genetic idea of your society so they are in that sense generally regarded as shall I say originating from what you would call the Pleiades or the Pleiades and they are in a sense reveling in the observation of your transformation as a design for again make no mistake about it you are fully within the major transformational age within the last several or tens of thousands of years of your society system so I'm going to track the tension because of part of the definition of that transformation is the expansion and willingness to include that much more in your reality it attracts the attention of extraterrestrial ideas that also revel in the choice and revel in the transformation so they are simply a sign of the time so to speak well they have to individuals as to whether they will society will depend upon your societal mass consciousness decision and this is the reason heretofore that this has not occurred societally speaking mass consciousnessly speaking many individuals are simply still in too much denial to allow for that type of interaction but this is changing even as we speak and as soon going to reach a new threshold whereby that physical type of more mass interaction will become possible at this point they are not likely to become the first civilization that your civilization becomes definitely aware of though it is possible they will perhaps be the second question does that answer the question is that oh oh sure I'm confused about the thing we're talking about how exciting co-fusion is simply the process of redefining yourself pulling pieces apart co-fusing fusing them back together with a new co-herency to fall into step with the new new very exciting you proceed talking about signature migration but that's like a thumb print every moment totally the soul print take the scenario that you're very attracted to another human being in your life and there are some perceived negatives that go along with that but this is the person and you just keep interacting okay is that what is that your signature is that your well in general again it is the covering and again I remind you that this is arbitrary and an analogy for explanation and it is not mechanically precise but it is more the overall mutable or changeable aspect of your vibration that is what individuals see and are the result of your actions and therefore establish the air perhaps you can say that you carry about it so but as so you have an uh an interaction for years with a person and then you change and this person change I mean it's like an reincarnation if you were if you came if you were living with this person in other lives I guess I'm very confused um the idea is this you will attract whatever it is that is a reflection of what you are exploring you have all with thousands of path lies not just a handful the reason only a handful stand out is because you are only exploring seemingly a finite number of issues in this life and only will the lies whereby similar things were explored make any sense or have any reason to feel connected to what you are now exploring so it is what you are exploring in this life that has you attracted to and interacting with this individual and then any path lies whereby you are together perhaps with a similar exploration we'll seem to stand out does that clarify the issue? but it still puts it back into the here and now it still puts it back into your actions creating your vibration and it still puts it back into the idea perhaps as an illustration that were your actions to now change according to the preferred you and you now become again more of the vibration of who you prefer to be and that individual does not do so chances are in this life you would begin to not see so much of each other if that individual happened to cope incidentally not by accident but cope incidentally explore his self empowerment and preference at the same time and you both come up again with the similar exploration chances are you will continue to explore through that common bond through that common exploration and action here and now so you have everything you need right here and now to explain everything about here and now and any other quote unquote path like tangent are simply wallpaper or decoration that allow you to enhance what you are exploring right now but not necessarily if you return that wallpaper you'll still have the room you'll still have the light thank you very much oh thank you and there will be but a few more sharing through this interaction over there if we make positive you know great changes or growth does that affect other lives that are going that we have had or you know in a sense you said that all lives are going out at one time do lives impact other ones well they can again as an enhancement but not as a direct impulse or force so again they can enhance the scenery but not produce a cause the cause is distinct and discrete and complete within each life so you truly have everything you need in every given moment to do anything you wish but however should you choose to explore integrated and radiate that outward you will then see bleed through from other lives perhaps future lives or aspects of path lives where that had been explored to seem again to stand up and then in concert seem to have some connection or continuity so it can be an enhancement but will never be the cause of causes nothing from a path life binds you any more than you define that it will no i i wasn't asking that i don't think it does no i understand but i am explaining the mechanism okay i think i understand well is there's some question which may clarify it first well can a no technological consideration do proceed i have a major revelation i have a major revelation and i've become a much more integrated being just that leaves through the lives whereby you had a similar revelation will seem to come to the surface and in a sense there will be an enhancement across the board yes okay now i understand thank you oh thank you over there three minutes i have reservations we have to ask this question on all reservations oh you talk about excitement and of course i understand i but i had a slight hang up or a question well how is fun an opportunity for clarification um do you think some people might abuse the theory or the philosophy and you just look out for themselves and not be considered considerate to other people and be self-centered would it feed the self-centeredness absolutely excitement without integrity yes that is why we are so emphatic about the linking of the two ideas simply doing what excites you period can have quite negative and self-destructive effects for each time you embody something that lacked integrity you can only have a result that would seem from your perspective to be lacking of integrity so you live the results of those decisions this is why again we are so emphatic about the integrity part doing what excites you period can perhaps be interpreted as Edenistic and self-ish in the way that you mean that term doing what excites you with integrity never will feel either of those particular pariahs for it will always be being the expression of who you choose to be being of service to yourself through the willingness to act upon that and being of service to everyone else through your recognition of integrity so they are two far different expressions all together and we generally do not even discuss the excitement without the integrity for that is not our perspective i guess there are but you could allow individuals in that sense losing the integrity aspects who seemingly run amok yes there could be certain situations where the line is so fine oh well not with integrity now if you really wish to be honest each and every one of you has a completely accurate completely immediate guide or gauge within you that tells you is this in integrity a yes or a no will come right up then you can rationalize yourself in or out of that but you always know fundamentally and if you say you don't you are simply playing a game you are not being honest with yourself so the line is never that fine is this within integrity yes or no the answer will always be obvious if you are honest yes thank you so that answered the question or are you still hanging off i guess i had to come off it certain specific situations then i can ask more detailed questions but in general and there could be for instance okay i'm going to talk about my personal situation that might make sense i when i decided to move out and be on my own of course the only thing that stopped me was my daughters two daughters very young and i was going to be separated from them and it wasn't a right thing for them so dear well that was there you did not make that decision since you have entertained the notions of excited with integrity so i assume in a similar set of circumstances you possibly would not have done that but the point is everything that has led you up to exactly where you are right now has been of service to you some of it has been in integrity some of it has been from out of integrity to explore the difference but you need not use that again as a form of self-play simply the acknowledgement that from this point forward you will express yourself in a different way yes okay that is that thank you shoney i would like to add further about something from our last introduction you told me that i have been a teacher and with many lifetimes in the in the yukatan well not only there but in one that is just one of the places what the what the idea that i have been a teacher many times i've been a spiritual teacher well in many ways yes but you have also physically been what you would call teacher of children on a more nuts and bolts level as well so you have both experiences to draw from when i went home in the evening as it was the next day i had um i have been told and have some remembrance of a lifetime there where i i i didn't act with an integrity when i had um power and i had some influence in the religion at that time and i felt very bad about it well you did not exist within a vacuum i assured you you were simply a product so to speak of the time and exploration of the entire civilization at that time so you were simply playing your part in that was shall we say later on in the history whereby much of the initial spiritual orientations of the civilizations had already began to take a back seat to feel so the things i introduced were a sign of the times at that time in exploring again negativity that ultimately ultimately wound up drawing similar negativity whereby the white brother simply was the deliverer of the same feeling that was being generated through the society in many cases the white brother meaning the coming up is vanished it did not have to happen that way but because the society at that point had to some degree steeped more in negativity and fear that in this particular stream of dimensional reality was what was attracted and only could have been what was attracted and allows you to see that there was quote unquote to use your slide trouble in paradise prior to that arrival for only could there have been that attraction if there was first that exploration going on is it i just all heard about that and it why it harms so many people well the idea is that they all chose a particular exploration you chose a particular exploration everyone played their part everyone got the effects everyone worked so i don't have to be guilty about it oh absolutely not it will always be up to you if it's not that i have i feel like it's just taking me so long to get my brochure to get everything together to be moving on this is it my guilt about things like that that has um um to it's my guilt and my need to create time well yes to a strong degree well what perhaps you have not factored into it and perhaps it is the timing in sharing this with you is that in a sense what you will create now will appear and again each life has distinct and creates and contains everything it needs but there will be the appearances in this life through the willingness to teach and perhaps the more older fashion a balanced creation so the very thing that perhaps you hesitate that have anxiety or fear about is the very thing that will wind up being most conducive to allow you to act your way or move or do your way through it this is the completion in many senses of a cycle that you have participated in almost every aspect of that cycle this is one of the most exciting aspects of the cycle for is the return home so to speak the integrative portion of the cycle so my i guess it's been hard for me to get used to the idea that i would be doing teaching you know our or a good part of teaching on these things and i really did assume and felt two weeks ago that i would that i would just say um you know facilitator and i can make reservations and things like that and i was just starting to accept that i'm a free year and other aspects as well and now that you understand a distinction between an older time and a more recent let's integrate this time you can as well begin to draw from the older time for that it's just as present just as simultaneous from the perspective of your higher self therefore just as accessible and in many ways more accessible for it is more a like of the exploration you are for taking up right now when you mentioned that therapy initiations and things like that that's in the sense and integrative but again they're drawing on the on the old but integrative and the present and it will ultimately always be a new expression if they have certain overtones and certain strengths that you will draw upon but it will always be a third new creation that is completely distinct for the now that you are creating and more relevant to the contemporary train of thinking upon the planet at this time therefore i don't need to be limited by my assumption that i would necessarily work with for example my and t-shirt or whatever because we are looking now and we can draw from many sources and we're creating a whole new world for us absolutely now that need not mean you exclude the possibilities but instead of fixating on that is the only possibility you actually increase your chances of attracting that as an enhancement remember co-teaching need not simply need to teach us it can mean as many and you can give different perspectives as well as ones that would seemingly only support themselves and it's completely up to you there are very strong chances as likelihood that you will at some point actually attract a month but you need not forsake that idea simply revel in the timing of it and not fixate upon it from now till then simply get going give the gift that you have to offer and make no mistake about it yeah now why don't you tell them the other places i'm going to that i'm really attracted to they're all just right because they're just because there are i'm interested in them i like them and therefore that's why we're going now could not upset it better myself thank you and all of you for it is always up to you to create the reality that you prefer and even the fact that you are considering that it is possible is highly encouraging for the idea is that will be the first step it does take one to no one so as you are knowing that you are also having the realization that you must contain it that it is not something separate that you need obtain it is not something external that you need to bring unto you but is something within you always within you that you can express and even to know it you must already be even to imagine something in that moment you are that thing in order to imagine it therefore this is the degree of your power this is the degree of your ability to call forth from the infinity within you anything that will allow you to express yourself according to preference according to excitement therefore we thank you for being willing to be the vibration of the individuals that you are and thank you for your continued willingness in sharing that vibration in a co-created reality that includes us it brings us great joy and as you perceive that you gain from these interactions understand in all uncertain terms that we gain just as much and do you all as gifts or fathits of a multi-dimensional crystal that is all that is and we thank you for sharing your fathits without us we bid you a most fond and loving life dream and dream lives and good evening
