 I bid you greetings this evening of your time as you create time to exist. I will not ask you how you are, for I know that you are all perfect. Allow me to begin with the following entitlement to appease those in presence, trusting the religion. We have been communicating with your society for quite some time in various forms through various individuals, in various timings to allow us to share the timing of the collective transformation of your society without interfering in your process by direct physical interaction. Therefore, this particular type of interaction that you refer to as channeling phenomena has given us the opportunity to learn more about you and to share with you things that we find helpful in our society and things that by the very nature of the fact that you attracted yourself to this interaction are very timely for your individual and collective transformation process. Through the time that we have interacted with members of your society in this way, we have covered, as you say, a lot of material. We have covered many ideas that have allowed you to redefine your understanding, your approach, and thereby your experience of your reality. We have, in that sense, covered many different issues from many different angles and facets to allow you in redefining yourself as an individual to begin to understand with a slightly different point of view, with a more empowered point of view, to be participatory in the creation of your life and your reality and your world, rather than simply a seeming random spectator. And thereby, in going through the process of communicating with you these many years of your time, have created definitions, have shared distinctions, have imparted ideas that have allowed you to begin in that sense to expand your approach, expand your awareness, expand the effect that you get in your life, to be able to begin to express yourself consciously, purposefully, effortlessly, while still creating challenge and meaningful experience. As these interactions take place, they change. As you transform the nature of the interaction between us, also by definition, transforms. For weeks you put a label on the face of interaction that we share with you now and for the past approximately two years of your time, perhaps simply as a label, it would be filed under the category of the simplification. For allowing you to create new distinctions, allowing you to understand different ways to define yourself, allowing you to literally recreate yourself from your old contracted, less empowered approach towards your new, open, expanded, effective approach, has served its course and now brings us to the point to remind you that the living, the implication of the things that we share and the things that you are now ready to express are truly quite simple. And so the many distinctions and definitions that we have shared come in handy, have their place, allow you to hinge and pivot your approach to begin to be more effective and productive in creating your life. However, the process of simplification allows you as a linear being to remain focused, focused to express yourself consciously without, as you say, too many details to distract you. The way that we have simplified our particular communications with you has been to take everything that we have shared, which by all means we can feel discussed in the quote unquote older definitional terms. But for now, allowing us to render this down to simply three ideas, the three ideas are indeed for every moment that you have created yourself as a physical being and for that matter for every moment that you have created yourself as any type of being you have ever or will ever be, three things are what you do and three things are all it takes in that sense to begin to shift who you are according to your preference, according to who you know yourself to be rather than any other criteria. By way of brief review, those three things are simply the decision, the trust in the decision and action. Action is the stuff that physical reality is made of so to speak. Now physical reality actually is created on a consciousness level, but you still function within the aparency of the necessity for action. And so we incorporate action into the idea because incidentally your actions change and the change in that physical output seems to be what creates the change in your reality. Therefore we include that to simply give you something to work with that falls within your strongest belief system about how you move your reality. That's interaction of your time we discuss in some detail the idea of part one, the decision and exactly what that means briefly in every given moment you create yourself 100 percent, not 99, not 98, not 80, 100 percent. And in that moment you make a decision, you make the decision about who you are. Now you already do this, always have as a physical being and in that way always will. So this is nothing new, you make a decision. Now up till now the basis of that decision this is who I am. You have created as being contingent or dependent on external circumstance, external symbology, timing and what you refer to as the past and the future. Therefore individuals would make a decision, this is who I am based on for instance their circumstance. Well here is my circumstance. So this must be who I am because my circumstances telling me so only this type of person would create this type of circumstance. And so therefore with that approach you use your circumstances as a gauge or a yardstick to make the decision in this moment this is who I understand myself to be, this is who I am and what this actually is is a decision about who you are. And we revise the wording to include the word decision because a decision can also be made consciously. The idea of conscious creatorhood, creating your life according to conscious means requires that you begin to entertain the idea of allowing your decisions to be conscious simply because you are going to make a decision anyway if you allow that decision to be conscious and according to who you know yourself to be your effect your results will be more representative of who you know yourself to be and who you wish to express yourself as a physical being. We also mentioned that individuals will use what you call their timing, their path, their future to decide in the moment this is who I am. So for instance they may say this is who I am and the reason that this is who I am the reason that I make this decision about myself is because this happened when I was a child. This happened in my past life. This happened yesterday. I did this then and therefore that is why I am who I am. When you make the decision in that way utilizing the path as your criteria for making the decision the decision still sticks so the effect that you get is yes you are that type of person and yes you are because of this thing that you did or this thing that happened to you or this thing that you experienced. The point that I am making is that you make this decision in every given moment and by simply being aware and entertaining the idea that this decision need not be dictated to you by circumstances and timing but can be created by you purposefully and constructively that little bit of information to take a mechanism you already use and apply it is all it takes to begin right now to completely redefine who you are. My way of a suggestion were you to be asked who you are who are you. My suggestion would be to begin to answer this question for yourself as we speak who is it you see yourself as your ideal self for you are going to make some decision and if you make a conscious decision all right I wish my life to now be joyous to now be in that way satisfying fulfilling inspired then all you need to do is create a decision about yourself consciously from your creative self from your center and include those ideas in the decision satisfaction inspiration motivation productivity whatever it is and therefore when one asks you who are you it is always up to you to then have that answer have that decision be the choice of who you know yourself to be rather than what timing and circumstance dictate now I remind you that you already do this you already make a decision whether you call it that or not that is what you do circumstance comes along and you tend to make a decision thinking that the circumstance is telling you who you are but actually still ultimately making that decision yourself by buying into it from all the stories you see it is only the story you buy into that determines your experience all of your experience that you feel occurs within you and to you is actually created from you and so is the decision becoming aware that the decision can now be made according to preference is a liberating notion and allowing yourself to be conscious about who you are is an expansive approach to your reality by being willing to commit to that decision and maintain that decision you get the effects of being the person that you now create yourself to be rather than that you have simply become because of and then the because of is your external circumstances and timing so in our last interaction we discussed purposefully allowing your decision to be registered allowing your decision to be a function of your will of your understanding of your desire and not dictated to you by whatever the elaborate criteria you create is therefore the second idea that allows you to implement that decision to change your life if indeed you feel there is the necessity to change it perhaps you do not is the idea of trusting the decision because you create yourself and each and every moment completely and each moment you make the decision about who you are if you have a consistency to that decision if you choose who you are and then continue to decide this is who I am then you create a continuity then you create the foundation through which you can begin to see the changes in your reality see the changes in your life through the eyes of the decision rather than through an older approach to your reality when you decide who you are you begin to see as that person and that person sees and interprets its reality and its external circumstances differently if it is an empowered decision your interpretation of your circumstance becomes everything in my circumstance supports my decision and therefore if something happens which is unexpected and perhaps formerly with my old decision undesirable it is now my opportunity to see that circumstance through the eyes of the new decision and therefore derive a different interpretation and a different effect because your approach will now be different it will be the approach of the you that you decide to be now as a distinction I again remind you we have discussed before what you call trust sometimes faith is also again something you always have often when mentioning the ideas trust the ideas say we hear what you call a rumbling of grown from individuals thinking oh I have to have faith oh boy that is difficult understand the irony of that understanding understand the irony of that statement having faith is difficult you always have trust you always have faith in something and if you think oh I am doubting and therefore not having trust understand that doubt is not a lack of trust doubt is a complete 100% trust in the reality you say you do not prefer therefore realizing this allows you to remove the sense of burden from the idea of trust because you do not have to muster it up build it up exercise your trust muscles and express it you already trusting something and therefore if you simply are accurate and constructive with your approach you can simply understand all right I am trusting in something now where that comes into this conversation is that you always make a decision and if you trust in that decision and act as though that decision has registered you get the effect of that decision if you say you do not trust the decision perhaps because again external circumstances would seem to indicate that the decision was not registered you are still trusting in something generally a disempowered idea and when you trust in that something it is truly the same thing as deciding that something instead of the something you prefer the point again is that you always do these things you always decide you always trust if you wish to remove the idea of subconscious intention unconscious action then simply being willing to make your decision consciously to trust your decision consciously is all it takes to use the mechanism you already employ in your life but use it constructively use it to have a desired effect create the life that you prefer trusting your decision trusting the decision is truly truly simply maintaining the decision you have the idea in your society as you begin to introduce to yourselves the notion that you create your own reality that you can affirm who you are and in a sense this is accurate often individuals will use what you call affirmation in a disempowered way where they are simply saying something and truly believe something else and attempting to talk themselves into something the type of affirmation that we are discussing which perhaps is more accurately called asserting or assertion is not talking yourself into something it is realizing that you're going to decide something anyway and allowing yourself to register that decision purposefully and consciously then when circumstance arises that may seem on the surface for just a moment due to your tendency of creating your reality in the older way the lesson powered way if something comes up which seems to run contrary to that decision you still have the opportunity in every given moment to reestablish the decision to remind yourself of the decision that you've already made maintaining maintenance of that decision is another way to state another way to call trusting the decision for it is simply using any feedback that you get from your reality whether it seems supportive or whether it seems in that sense to be opposite of your decision to re-align you to your decision to be an opportunity to re-align you to your decision interestingly enough because you create yourselves 100% in every given moment the moment you make the decision you are that person no offense or but no room for anyone else that is who you are your willingness to trust that your decision has registered itself sticks in your reality is also another way to define what we mean by trusting the decision it is the complete confidence that the decision about who I am has been made by me consciously I was going to make a decision anyway I choose to make it consciously and I believe I trust I insist that that decision sticks and in making that decision I am that person therefore you are now willing to begin to see as that person making the decision by the way is a very definite act of creation when you state your decision when you begin in that sense to explore who it is you are and render who you are into what you call a sentence or two for you to invoke that up within you making that distinction creates you as that being therefore perhaps it is in your best interest to refrain from working into the decision ideas or words that imply that you are already not that person in other words it is the thing saying this is who I am rather than this is who I will be this is who I wish to be this is who I am becoming the act of becoming is distinct from the act of being therefore if you were your decision I am becoming this I am evolving toward that I am slowly achieving this then that effect is worked into the result that you experience from your decision being willing to remove all that terminology and simply saying this is who I am perhaps just because I say so allows you to experience yourself as that person in that moment and when you begin to truly trust it when you begin to apply your trust consciously you will begin to feel the tinge of excitement knowing that now that you are this person you can truly only expect the results that that person would get which I assume if you have been getting results you do not desire in your life would be viewed as most attractive most desirable trusting the decision is simply maintenance of the decision the establishment of the decision being willing to be specific about that decision allowing your reality to feed back to you where you can in that sense realign to that decision and perhaps also allowing your reality to show you where you may wish to make alterations or read visions in the decision your decision as you establish it now will only be a result of who you know yourself to be now and the things that you feel are available to you now as you begin to express yourself anew as the preferred you circumstance experience and what you attract will change and you very well may revise to an even more empowered status the decision that you make about yourself and by all means be willing to be open to allowing the decision to be honed carved worked in such a way where it is polished and where it truly reflects who you are the moment you make the decision and trust that that decision sticks you then get to social speed reality test the decision and see if the decision works for you if it isn't an empowered decision no matter what changes you're making it over time it will still remain foundationally and empowered approach that can only allow you to yield positive experience in your life again you already do this you already do this you already decide who you are you already truck either in the decision of who you are or shift your trust make a new decision and get a new effect if you go back and forth shifting decision shifting decisions that is a random random expression of your decision I need not tell you that randomly shifting your decision creates an atmosphere of experience that feels random and thereby your life feels that it happens to you rather than from you your life feels random rather than purposeful your life feels like accidental rather than synchronous or serendipitous and these experiences are all from decisions that you already make therefore allowing yourself to simplify simplify your creative ability by simply very finally honing in and stating your decision clarifying that decision that vision and stating it after the words I am and allowing your body posture and your attitude to exemplify that decision I am this person that is what trusting the decision is all about if you begin to observe yourself in your life you will see in no uncertain terms how you are already doing this and perhaps can fascinate yourself at the many creative ways that you actually support the experiences in your life you say you do not prefer by participating in the continuance of these negative results through decision by having those decisions seem to be dictated to you by circumstance and timing observing this still is making the decision not to make a positive decision but at least it is a step in the direction of entertaining the idea that perhaps you just might have something to do with the creation of your reality therefore by all means take as much time as you need create whatever process you wish create whatever elaborate set of steps will allow you to finally make the decision but understand no matter what process you create no matter what ritual you participate in ultimately at some point along that linear process you will get a result and that result will not not in any way be due to the process but only be due to in that moment making the decision this is who I am and saying the reason that I can now be this person is because of this elaborate process but ultimately it is the decision after the process now it's all right to be this person that allows you to be that person and not the process in any way understanding this allows you to begin to decide who you are right now not needing to create a process unless you find that most enjoyable and immediately and completely transforming the face of your entire life and reality transforming your experience transforming your interpretation of your reality immediately transforming your relationships to yourself and others making the decision consciously is an empowered creative act having that decision be purposeful is using your creative ability purposely having the results and the experience of your life be the result of conscious ideas uses the same mechanism that you already use to create ideas you consider to be unconscious or subconscious so all the tools that you already use can by simply shifting your perspective my newtly can be used constructively can be used positively not because you need to change not because you are not a valid being right now not because you are not loved by all that is right now but simply because perhaps you're ready for a change it's up to you as we now proceed to the interaction and allow for the exchange between you and myself and members of my society from time to time as we begin our interaction I will ask you a question each one of you the ones that I choose and I am asking this question to allow you to begin to consider who you are in a conscious way therefore when we speak individually as you say should I ask you who are you be willing if you wish to play along I will not force anyone to have too much fun to stake the positive decision of who you are indefinite and absolute terms thereby giving you the ability and opportunity to see who it is you desire to be now because I understand the way that you create gathering and speaking in public and so forth as I ask you who you are it is always your option to say I have not yet committed to that decision so do not feel on the spot or that you must in that sense define yourself but if you are willing to that will be your first step in beginning to express yourself in conscious terms beginning to express yourself according to preference beginning to allow your experience to reflect who you know yourself to be rather than who everyone says you seem to be how you interpret your circumstances tell you you are how your path has resulted in your lot in life or for that matter how your future has resulted in your lot in life or often individuals will define themselves not only by their past timing but as we had said earlier by their future timing well I need to do this I haven't done that this needs to be handled this needs to be taken care of and the bottom line of the decision in that moment is I am not a prepared being and expect my reality to have a negative outcome perhaps if I swim a little harder run a little faster and work a little bit more laboriously I might just head off the process all right that's one way to look at it but it is not necessary conscious creator and the statement of a conscious creator always begins by the sentiment or the wording I am fill in the blank you get to choose what goes in that life you already do now that you know this you can play a shell game with your intentions and consciousness but there is no escaping the fact that you now have the information you now have revealed to yourself in perfect timing utilizing what you consider to be me as a reflection of what you already know to be true for yourself and now are willing to hear and create as an external reflection in your life me when I say that you create your reality 100 percent I mean it therefore everything that you see is a reflection of you the paradox is that this is true for all other individuals but you need not confuse and perplex yourself with that idea simply marvel over it from time to time but because everything exists within you every single thing you perceive is created by you to support any decision that you make in your reality sometimes circumstance will seem to support your decision by simply being a circumstance whereby you would interpret it saying ah see my decision stuck there is a circumstance that proves it but the other way that you deliver feedback to yourself is by providing examples that seem to run contrary to your decision to allow yourself to really decide if this is who you are or if you can easily be talked out of that decision and then ultimately make a new decision according to what everyone says what circumstances and timing dictate but it is up to you to remain focused and up to you to continue to express yourself consciously continuously for your willingness to interact with me and establish that at least part of your decision is to begin to explore more of yourself and attract symbols external symbology that begins to support your empowered decision I thank you I thank you for allowing me to act as facilitator but more accurately as a mirror for only can you appreciate and utilize and understand anything that you perceive that I am saying if you first already contain it otherwise the channel's mouth would be moving and you would hear no words coming out the fact that you hear it the fact that it resonates with you the fact that it seems to inspire you is your direct indication that you already contain that potential within yourself or ultimately speaking you are an infinite multi-dimensional and eternal being and you contain it all we also get a lot out of these interactions we also see all of you as an external reflection of us and understand that each unique point of view that we interact with that seems like an interaction with an external being is simply more personal exploration of facets of our own particular individual consciousness therefore in not knowing what you are going to say so to speak in marveling and reveling with your particular approach to your reality as I interact with you I understand because you are simply a reflection of me to me that much more about myself that much more about who I am as a being and therefore the exchange in these interactions is completely an equal exchange I thank you for your willingness to allow me to interact with you in this way albeit an unconventional way presently in your mass society for the honor of your willingness to allow me to reflect to myself who I am to allow you to reflect to yourself who you are again I thank you unconditionally lovingly and ask how we may now be mutually of service to each other through the sharing shedding I would like to I almost brought a friend first of all thank you very much for one more may I ask you a question who are you I am a person who just recently has finally discovered that I deserve to be happy and I made the decision to come down here tonight in this horrendous weather all by myself and all the time I was in the car I felt completely calm and I thought if I've made this decision I must know what I'm doing and I'm going to carry it through and it was no mishap or anything to get here and I worry your result different from any former result you had to rise yes oh yes very different I thank you for being a living example of what I am saying could you be just a little more specific about myself well I still have a lot of boogie men in the closet all right and I still have a lot of fears that I'm facing is it joyous for you to continue in your decision to express that factor now all right then I suggest now that you are being very definite and conscious about who you are that you work in the wording that allows you to experience the freedom of who you are without the self-imposed shackles of these ideas and again when you are asserted who you are decided who you are be willing to word it in the positive do not define yourself in terms of who you do not wish to be or who you are not but simply be willing to say who you are now if I were to ask you who you are and you had formulated a way to express yourself which no longer was relevant to boogie men and fears and closet how would you word that I am a person who can make my own decisions trusting that the outcome will be what I prefer over how does that feel good how does it feel to understand and know on certain terms that you are that person right now very good are you willing to trust that decision by maintaining it no matter what yeah congratulations now may I ask a question proceed when you were talking about redefining ourselves and participating in our creations of our realities I have a friend that they almost brought with me tonight who's had a very horrendous she 45 years old and she's had a lot of physical mishaps two strokes and brain tumors removed and she was badly physically and emotionally abused as a child and so she has many personalities with which she deals more than 35 at least three of whom I have met oh how well-rounded right and I just wondered when you when you were talking about creating your reality and making a decision can can she be able to do this and finally inter it's she's been at it two and a half years absolutely positively she already does it and that is the liberating notion for her to understand what do you mean she already she already makes a decision that results in the seeming fragmentation of her one consciousness but she's not conscious of making that decision well if you tell her then she will be whatever degree she is willing to embrace that idea she just says when things happen she just lets one of the others tenants you know handle it for her a decision okay because I would like to play this tape for her and I think it would be really you are the tape and the way you understand it and assimilate it is your unique way and therefore whoever you attract and interact with will benefit from your unique presentation of that idea so by all means utilize any physical tools that you attract but do not remove yourself according to the decision that you have shared with me you would be more than willing as that person to simply explain in whatever way is obvious to you these ideas but not with any hint of insisting that the exploration that she now creates is invalid it is quite valid it is quite equal to any other exploration empowered or disempowered exploration that she may ever choose and this is another helpful distinction in exercising your decision consciously to exercise that decision between equal options equal choices with equal weight some decisions may be or some options may be more or less preferable but by allowing them to have equal weight equal value and as an exploration that gives you equal access to choosing anyone so what she is going through and creating is all well and good there are alternatives if she so wishes to apply the system she already expresses consciously when she begins to simply decide and entertain the mere notion you mean I can consciously decide who I am there will already be an absorption and an assimilation of what she has considered to be fragmented personality to the expression as one person but not running from 35 individuals that she is simply walking toward the one being she now desires to express herself as which is not invalidating the 35 but simply choosing because it is also an equal option the one expression one other question you may ask her is now we understand societally how having many personalities can be what you call an inconvenience however simply posing to her from this point of view what I am about to say is such a different approach that it may also allow her to turn a key within her and that can be simply saying to her I understand what you are experiencing and I understand that it can be inconvenient what I would like to ask you is to if you are willing search within yourself from a slightly different point of view and answer the following question to whatever degree you are willing to explore yourself and the question simply would be I understand how it has been an inconvenience but on the other side of the coin again what about expressing yourself as this multiplicitous being has actually served you I understand the inconvenience but what have you gotten out of it what have you been forced to look at that you would not have looked at otherwise now that if she wishes to explore the reasons that she creates a present decision as the prerequisite for making a new purposeful decision however although individuals will often wish to understand why they are the way they are if it is an undesirable way before they will allow themselves to change and certainly you can approach it this way one of the things that I am here to tell you is that again it is a choice but it is not necessary it is truly not necessary to define why you have turned out in such an undesirable way to decide and change your decision and your expression individuals will insist well I can obviously only change if I understand who I am and so they create the process by which they explore who they are being perhaps they come to a recognition of why perhaps not but ultimately it is none of that exploration that actually results in making the new decision this is the person that I desire and choose to be and so ultimately they wind up when they finally change doing the same thing that she can simply do right now without the soul searching all decisions that are disempowered come along with a lot of baggage a lot of reasons that you can support why this must be who I am there is a big distinction between saying I am this person and I must be this person because you can again explore who you must be and why you must have been that person or you can simply decide all right all right all right all ready it does not matter why I am this person any longer because exploring why I am this person simply keeps my attention on one thing being this person over and over bringing in the history bringing in the evidence bringing in the logic creating the support for why I am this miserable rotten undesirable intellectual person in my reality no judgment it is a valid exploration but ultimately it will be her decision can I just ask you one thing in support of it her both her parents died two years ago and she was told never to tell you these things that happened at home and one of her personalities see every week she writes a letter one of the personalities writes a letter to the psychologist and then the next week they discussed what this personality has said through that personality if you understand what I mean obviously and one of them has said that her father will get her from beyond the grave and is trying to influence her and spoiler life and will cause terrible things can can spirits have died or gone on still interact with us well only to the degree that you are willing to create your version of them you'll reason for feeling the desire to communicate with them and ultimately the interpretation of what you perceive to be the message that's what I told her yeah oh thank you you are rendering my job unnecessary and that indeed is one of my perhaps you can say underlying goals if I do my job correctly I put myself out of a job thank you I have done nothing you are male other male hey perfect and you perfect who are you I'm a healer oh what congratulations can you speak of the concept of the decision in light of the transmutation process that the human species is going through at this time well as we have explained many times in many different ways many different approaches from our perspective your body exists within your consciousness and is a direct reflection of your consciousness now your decision can work and get the effect of either approach one approach is that your consciousness is within and a result of your physical body and therefore in order for your consciousness to express itself more fully there need be a physical expansion and assuming that point of view assuming that decision truly will give you the effect and the evidence that yes I made a physical transformation now I can house more consciousness however it is just as valid to understand that your body exists within your consciousness and as you shift your consciousness your body shifts accordingly if you wish to be most accurate it always first begins in consciousness and even when a person winds up achieving the effect I can now expand my consciousness because I have evolved my DNA or whatever they will experience a shift they will experience more of their consciousness it will seem or seem to be supported that it was the physical change that allowed this but here's what I ask you and ask such an approach where did more of this consciousness that you've become come from it came from you where out there well that's one way to look at a need of a change of like the morphogenetic structure of which the mass consciousness is a part of your morphogenetic structure though you have been taught to believe is an environmentally determined factor is a consciousness determined factor already shifts when you shift most obviously the creation of what you call this ease and discomfort is one way to understand the negative effects of negative decisions whether they be conscious or unconscious decision and then the corering responding results thereof but it truly takes place on a genetic level as well transmutation permutation evolution and so forth is simply a reflective response to a shift in consciousness foundationally use the terminology decision to replace the previous expression that you use being an intention and there's got to be a reason for that because intention is always something you can put off though tomorrow whereas decision seems to be more immediate in its effect and assessment well congratulations in very creatively structuring the answer into the question in the process of simplify and bringing things down to their most vasol elements being intentionful is one way to describe it but making the decision has a more definitive consciously commanded implication all the different ways as we had began this interaction by saying all the different ways of defining your reality understanding the nuances in your reality serve their purpose and play with the fact that you generally have chosen up to the fact that you are now creating this recognition of immediate decision and result have been the result of your perception and the way that you were taught to understand that things occur on a gradient so the idea of introducing it initially as intention allowed you to still come at it from your older decision your older points of view your lesson powered points of you to begin to entertain slowly spoon fed slowly the idea of having some kind of say in what's going on now again as you have pointed out we choose to simply make things more definite simply make them more of a complete and purposeful and utter unswerving statement so there is no more methodology other than as you stated in your introduction conscious decision trust in that decision and then taking actions to support the trust that you have that decision which you already did and therefore is no big deal nothing you need to learn no resource that you need to attract or create simply as everything else is as you are fundamentally and foundationally a shift and idea your consciousness applying itself consciousness I have found it in this last month it doesn't work but what thank you for allowing that to be worked into your decision and being specific about being a sexual can also be quite in that sense useful who else are you so all right when will you get there well are you on your path or are you the actual path wording is very key not to correct you for that it's truly impossible I can simply provide another alternative that you may wish to choose but wording is very key and when I ask you who you are be willing to look at how you word it do not judge yourself if the wording is a lesson powered wording congratulate yourself for catching it and honing in and revising the nature of the statement of your decision do you wish to tell me one more factor of who you are oh what your choice I thank you shivin cloud mail thank you and as well good evening good day yeah good day you're on your planet spacecraft I am on my craft and in a particular shall I say position in my orbital path it is day ah great I really miss uh speaking with you so this is really enjoyable for me all right how about speaking with yourself right that is what you are doing anyway yeah right um it's interesting because this decision I understand that when we come here as souls okay we we make a decision to to lead a life and experience the life here may I say something yeah all right I would anyway that decision is very very very general it generally will not take the form I will do this thing in that place at that time I will explore this very finite and specific issue generally the overall decision is I will create explore and experience the effects of a linear existence whereby although I am an all-knowing infinite conscious being that is simultaneously existing right now and knows it all I will create the opportunity to impose a veil of forgetfulness on 99.999 and so on percent of my knowingness so that I can have the joyful unique experience of discovery of exploring of unexpected outcomes all of which do not inherently have relevance to an infinite all-knowing all-seeing frame of consciousness so fundamentally generally foundationally that decision is to utilize that advantage that this reality affords you do proceed right so in the decision coming here and experiencing life we come also with an assortment of agreements with ourselves basically but with other souls also correct I assume that you work that into your moment to moment decision right but do not need to it is only one way to look at it completely valid but in the moment that you shift your decision if that new decision is irrelevant to all that so-called exploration it will no longer have any relevance to you so those are very loose they do not bind you they do not determine your outcome in any way other than when they are working to the decision that you make well it is there a bit of a paradox because I think that these agreements need to be put not need are asking to be fulfilled with souls different souls that is your decision and you will achieve that effect yeah we create moments and moments and that we are in control nothing is in stone right so it's a bit of paradox because we it seems like we can have control over each little new moment we create it yet the agreement needs to be fulfilled what is your definition of control does it mean a rigid absolutely predictable outcome for a rigid absolutely predictable outcome is not utilizing the spirit of the joy of discovery that this reality affords you and so therefore if you say no as you just did and allow that definition to loosen up so that it may express itself in many different ways and perhaps some of those ways will be completely unexpected then it does not run contrary to allowing your perception therefore your decision of agreements to play out okay does that make sense yes all right person I like to get to the specifics that relates to my life that I wanted to ask you about it's about my children they did relocate physically and I'm wondering about that agreement because it's pretty major move may ask you a question all right now ask you another question all right good thinking close your eyes assume that your children physically moving is extraneous and an interruption in your process yes are you doing that yeah explain how you feel it's quiet it feels out of line out of whack it doesn't seem like it flows more specific is it not emotionally jarring yes it is not intense it's about is it not negative you're not expressed here and anger and distrust yes oh you can stop are your eyes still closed yes all right assume for a moment that the absolute most beneficial way for you to create the relationship that you absolutely prefer with your children can only be achieved by this move having been made and playing out in its timing are you doing that yes yes how does that feel it feels sobering and refreshing which is I have approached it that way oh yes it feels good well then you have gone nowhere and created two distinct sets of emotion and all that you have done and I thank you for illustrating the topic at hand is shift your decision and the shift in the decision comes along with a shift in emotion a shift in thinking ultimately cannot help to have a shift in action and therefore cannot help to have a shift in the result now both of those choices are true and I do not say this to be totally confusing I say this to let you see the extent to which they are equal choices and the only effect that you can possibly get out of them will depend on which one you assert and assume and I mean assume in the terms of trying it on assuming a posture not an assumption that something might be so it is so when you sat and made that first decision that was so you felt that way you attracted the evidence when you shifted your decision simply because you entertained the idea that such a thing was possible along came the supportive structure the logic the evidence and came along with that now when I say both are true I truly mean it therefore the idea that this physical move is not only beneficial are you paying attention very much but essential to your relationship being in its most positive life how does that feel does that take the pressure off so to speak are you fluctuating in your decision as we speak well when you really come up with it when you beat it is far more purposeful far more definite than the tone that you are expressing it to again not invalidating you simply pointing out sit up straight make the statement do not be as you say in your slide wishy washy about it wishy washy very interesting terminology fascinating language do you understand what I am is this useful or if it's simply every philosophy no no no you you're speaking exactly what I understand you completely oh no I would suggest if you are already doing it that perhaps you are still not fully committed or weren't until we are having this discussion to truly accepting your decision and then allowing any opportunity any external circumstance any timing any history any future allow that to support your decision see through the eyes of that decision act as a person who has made that decision rather than is waiting for the feedback to allow it to be okay to make that decision these are distinct gradations and nuances of decision decision can be fully committed statements of who you are with complete purposefulness or they can be again slightly wishy washy I was wondering if you have anything to add to I created this situation and that now this allows me to do something absolute and that would perhaps be a more constructive way to look at it now does it excite you that it might be creating a new opportunity all right then use that energy and I assume when observing members of your species and members of mine as well when you have a positive expectancy that excitement drives you motivates you inspires you so if you do not feel driven inspired and motivated in that moment you are perhaps expressing either a different decision or not as defined and clear a version of the same decision so remind yourself of your decision trust the decision it is registered it is so so you can proceed with the excitement of understanding that which then aids in it fits your so-called energy level to then support the actions of your new decision okay and for a nice touch too to also get into the emotion feel the emotion that is bringing up now if you find the creation of negative emotion perhaps your way to allow yourself to shift most quickly is to first allow yourself to experience it have it be all right to feel this all right I understand that this negative emotion fear lowness abandonment whatever this negative emotion must be the result of a distant power decision that I am making right now and by all means I intend to have my decision be reestablished but before I do let me experience my creation let me feel this fear let me feel let me feel this apprehension although it may seem that it could overwhelm me that it could kill me it really can't and therefore allowing yourself to experience it actually will wind up supporting the re-establishment of your positive decision because when you understand I feel this fear therefore the decision I am making now is that I am alone that I am not loved that I am not supported and when I make that decision this is how I feel well perhaps I do not desire to feel this way on a regular basis so now I know without any doubt that this negative decision feels this way and that reminds me I would rather have this decision over here okay so how can I interpret that through the the eyes of a four-year-old or a six-year-old of how I'm not so worried so much worried about me because I know I can take care of myself but I'm worried about can they take care of themselves without me or you know that part of what they're going to be missing can I maybe use my power to create a little bit more security and love on their behalf better say what I'm saying hey I'm simply waiting for you to tell me to go since you told me to stop goodbye all right now I understand as what you call parental unit and your society that it is generally your training to assume that you must be responsible for the individuals that you are quote unquote guardian of but you can only be responsible to them and not for them regardless of four years old one hundred and four years old so therefore exploring the ramifications of what they are going through in terms of taking responsibility for it does not put you in the most empowered position to have your decision be effectual have an effect in their life what they are going through is what they are going through if the opportunity to arrive is to dialogue with that by all means you can clarify your understanding of what they are going through but truly the example that you provide is the largest service is being responsible to them rather than for them and you need not concern yourself with the effects on them as though they too do not have sovereignty and decision-making capability you may reassure them that on some level they are participating in this timing for a reason if they wish in that sense to understand the reason by all means they can explore it if not well your children have a tendency to begin to engage themselves in other things quite quickly so are you willing to be responsible to those individuals rather than for them yes does that not then allow you to feel more whole and therefore effective congratulations now you can go shilik hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey oh i really wanted to ask this um they have to do with everything you're talking about oh well that depends who are you well i am a person who makes a conscious decision every minute of the day about who i am and what i'm going to do ah a person who decides to decide very interested i make decisions all the time about my choices and i see them as my decisions and if they're uh instantaneously manifest what i decide by the way that is quite accurate yeah well when you decide who you are you are that person the entire reality is now shifted it is the reality of that person now how you begin to be able to experience that is where the trust in the decision comes in which is the maintenance of the decision that allows you in linear time in a physical reality to begin to see what you perceive to be external reflections because of the degree that you still create a gap or a void which by the way at any time can be dyscreated but do proceed there is a gap in a void there i'm doing lots of exciting things in my life and i'm really thrilled about the way they're going but there's one area that i'm not making a decision that uh i feel i can commit to my other decisions seem easy to commit to this one seems wishy washy oh what can you explain well one of the reasons is because i can't really see as you said uh what the end result will be the positive end result and so the idea is tutoring yeah assists you to make a less than adequate decision yes or what if i have a goal or an ideal that i want to attain it's a lot easier to decide who i'm going to see at that moment to get to that ah so you decide to be a person that needs a carad dangling in order to move very creative do you desire to have this limitation no can you simply understand the following if you picture doing the thing that would be most fulfilling to you in your entire life and picture yourself doing that thing play the imagination tool game to be that person and watch yourself in your imagination already being that person then ask yourself who am i when you come up when you derive the decision of who you are in your preferred state you can simply import that decision to this moment so that is one way you can actually use futuring positive futuring in this case to establish and maintain and create your decision right now however ultimately it is the creation and assertion of the decision right now that has the effect not any carrot dangling or promise of a result okay well the area that yes i feel that i i do that for the most part the the area that i feel wishy washy about is my place on earth relative to the health of the earth the well-being of the earth we live in such a complicated society now by the way simply for the purposes of distinction i asked you who you are and you are telling me your decision your story your perception is created through the eyes of the decision that you have made already that this is the way things are which is fine which is valid but i am pointing this out to you to understand anything that you may in that sense attempt and i will use that word purposefully to describe to me as an excuse for not being who you fully desire to be i will understand that that is part of the decision that you are now making so as we are speaking perhaps it will occur to you that you now have the ability in bringing this to light in bringing this to the surface to begin to shift all of these preconceived notions which are the same way of saying former aspects and facets of former decisions well all of these are choices are they not each one of these aspects well i see all of these aspects and i can't make a decision well if you say so you have just decided i can't make a decision and therefore voila as you say i thought i'd love to make more decisions and that decision doesn't feel like it's the most positive choice i put myself in another decision and that doesn't feel like it's not is this referred to in your society as decision hopping perhaps you can utilize your own system of emotion feedback to allow that your decision and the establishment of your decision must feel right to you so if it does not feel right that is not your decision thank you out of the way where's my decision ah right here oh that feels right decision made that is how simple this is that is what you already do anywhere he's out of the system yes you do not sound sure you are deciding to be uncertain when you're when you're demanding of the environment uh so much that it is depleting its life force i know that's not true but you know what i mean well do you know what you mean what you are stating to me is decisions that contain mutually exclusive contradictions so listen to how you describe your reality then decide how you wish your reality in that sense to react to manifest itself one way to look at your planet is the way you are saying overburden by human kind nasty human kind or human kind is also nature as we have recently entertained the idea of interestingly enough you consider what you call your insect the ant to be nature if the ant builds a lovely ant hill that is nature but for some reason when a human builds a house oh that is technology you need not separate your understanding of yourself from nature to then create a necessity a necessity to link back to something which you truly can ever be this this this this out one more which you have not ever been separated from to begin with thank you you're getting making progress oh wow i thank you for allowing me in that sense to misutilize the lips of the channel at this timing we will pause for a necessarily short break and resume contact in 10 to 15 minutes of your counting
