 I have an other side. How do you? I have a question for my product, who else? Oh, right. He's in Minneapolis now. Oh. He's been doing some channeling. And the FCD who he's been channeling is Tetra. And he wanted to clarify the question on the relationship. What he's getting is that it's blending of his future as he's found himself and an arturian connection. And he wanted to know if he could come upon that at all. The idea being that you, in a sense, failed to mention the main connection, Earth. Stay grounded to the idea that this is the particular reality through which you are now, and I am speaking to him, choosing to be within. Therefore, any influence, any nuance, any inspiration from any of these other realms, all well and good. But the service that is being rendered and the channeling that is being done is being done to Earth. Therefore, head in the clouds, all right. Feet on the ground is a must in order to complete the circuit to allow the full flow. So therefore, again, it is all well and good and can be quite positive to explore these other relationships, these other connections. Tonight, but the main connection is the connection with this particular reality. The main service will be rendered through this particular reality. And he has everything he needs in this particular reality in order to manifest this idea due to proceed. Well, as good as his question, we don't have any hookups to the microphone. Well, thank you very much. So I didn't have much attention. Please, let me say, oh, there we thank you. So always unexpected. Congratulations. Thank you. But it was picked up by your other Microsoft, is there more? Yes, you wanted to ask God if there was any elaboration on the communications he's getting in terms of blending the child and the adolescent and the adult, which I think you kind of went into on your answer before. In terms of being grounded and seeing his relationship with himself. Simply one word. Now, whatever is happening right now is what has within it the opportunity to do all the things he wishes to do. What's right there, right there. Not what's out in the distance, not what's back there, but what's right there, right now. That now moment is the only experiential moment there is. All moments come together in each and every now moment. Each and every now moment is holographic and therefore ultimately integrative. But again, action. The channeling, the receiving of the information is only part of the process. The willing to apply it, render it. That is what will allow, shall we say, room for more information, more communication. Each time he does something about it, that allows the next communication to take place. He will understand much of this. He's down. Thank you. That's who you are. Sure. You're male. You're male. Sure. This is curiosity at my point. Oh, just curious. There is no idle curiosity. Do proceed. How many oversold are here on the planet Earth? We shall stand to see whether it is within our realm to apply another one moment. Now, understand, this is quite an arbitrary figure and in that sense is ever fluctuating. In that each moment is a nexus point which connects to all other moments, all other parallel realities. And therefore, shall we say, it is ever fluctuating. At this particular moment, our strongest sensing would be what would translate to 2.8 billion. Now, we understand that this is less than the overall population of your planet, but again, understand as well as the fact that you have future lives, past lives. The idea is you also have counter-part lives, contemporary lives within the same timeframe. And this would account in that sense for the larger number. But again, it is fluctuating. Is this a service in any way? I don't know. Oh, right. But I have another question. You show why can we have different blood types on Earth? It is simply a different physiological symbol, representative of particular nuances and consciousness, which will vary from individual to individual. In other words, there are as many reasons as there are individuals. Is there some specific idea that you are seeking? I just didn't understand why one person would have a heartache, a negative, or an a positive, or an a negative. And I think we all can't, supposedly, the same source. It allows you in that sense to express individuality, and at the same time have a connection to groups of individuals. Okay. Thank you for showing me. Oh, man. Yeah, for sure. It is a good time, I'm out of play. It is a tremendous, considerable conclusion. Oh, that's very good. You choose the power to decide, and at the same time I feel I need to earn my kids. Oh, do you have a built-in definition? That the thing that excites you will not support you? I feel that Mr. Chase is the power of my life, and he was there for his needs for transition over a certain time span. Oh, well, very often individuals will create the need, which it is created, and not an inherited need, for a gradient. Facing in one idea and out the other, rather than taking what you might label a need of faith, either way works. Can you define what it is that excites you the most? Not specifically clearly, it is. Oh, well, you do know, so allow us to start out by telling you that. Are you willing, in that sense, to bring it forth and stay with bold conviction? And, by the way, this would also be the suggestion of a starting place. In other words, it would be difficult to determine whether or not what excites you will support you if you have not determined what excites you. But when you do, most often you will find that even within the confines of your society, directly, it can, in that sense, be the type of service which, when offered, will give the opportunity for some type of exchange of abundance. But defining what it is that excites you, because very often your society teaches you out of it, so to speak, would be the starting place. Does something come to mind? Well, what I'm doing is taking classes with Richard, and I'm learning how to utilize that energy that I am. Oh, what do you wish to do with it, for again, it will always boil down to the action step. This is a physical world, and the manifestations more directly occur from the actions. So I would want to do service in a things like support myself. Or what type of service? Feeling or helping people or... Are these not ideas upon your planet that do not yield monetary exchange? From what I believe, that's why I want the pseudo-parallel course, where I'm actively pursuing a grievance right now, with my company, and I like the potential of being reinstated. At this time I was like, I always perceived a parallel happening, and it was the thing that I get confused. Well, confusion is very good, because it really is unlocking from one reality, and co-fusing, bringing together, and fusing many ideas to emerge within a new reality. So therefore it is quite a positive step, and it is simply the judgment of the confusion itself, which generally yields the negative effect. But again, our suggestion, and again you don't have to, would be to determine what it is that excites you. And begin in each and every moment from what's available, to act on what excites you, maintaining the intention of the overall thing. And you will find that by doing, not thinking, not conceptualizing what would happen if you do it, but doing the things that excite you the most, they always bring along with them. First of all, the idea of being effortless, second of all, all the abundance you need in order to continue to do it, and third of all, leads you to the next most exciting thing. Before we proceed, however, allow us again to give our definition of abundance, which is simply the ability, the ability to do what you need to do, when you need to do it. If you narrow your focus to the only way that you will accept that you have that ability is one symbol, money, you will create a tunnel vision that will not allow you to see only other ways. If you will simply understand that you always do have that ability and begin to exercise with positive trust, that ability, then you will be allowing the mechanism that we are speaking about to manifest, which will bring along again the abundance to continue to do that thing and lead you to the next thing, which will then bring along its abundance to allow you to continue. You see the universe always supports who you are being, and if you are being a person who is not true to yourself, it even supports that. So if the universe is supporting you being who you're not, it would only go to say that it would just as well support being who you are, and the idea of a security in going, quote unquote, back to some idea that allowed you to perpetuate who you're not, what type of security is that, the security that you continue to be who you're not. It is, I assume, a form of security, but shall we say perhaps not the preferential idea, and you can now correct yourself, you deserve it, the things you prefer with integrity. Can one work a regular job and be in a state of preference? Yes, but not at that regular job is something that makes you miserable, and you're only doing it for the money to be able to do what excites you the most. And that is what individuals create in your society, we are not trialing it, simply pointing it out. Are we getting something? Yes, I'm not in there. Oh, let's address the no. Can you phrase another question? I feel carried a belief of transition, and my human condition requires transition into age. Oh, and then let's work with that belief. Now what this implies is that you maintain a foothold doing the thing that perhaps you do not prefer, that provides the money. But what it also presupposes is that you try and begin to do the thing that excites you as well. So therefore, if you must, in that sense, continue to hold that belief, begin to factor in, begin to try and begin the things that do excite you. At least. Does that make sense? Yes, it does, but you're also paying, and just you're not seeing this, you're turning this. I'm saying that it is instantaneous, it is a transition, it is up to you. If you are saying that you are more prone to allow yourself to believe it is a transition, you can also get there that way. If you wish for it to be simultaneous, then begin to only do what excites you in each and every moment with integrity. And again, as a reminder, we do not mean the moralistic sense of integrity. We mean integrity as it relates to the integration of all things. The integration of all things means that you understand that God or all that is is everything, even you. It is all one thing. You are a part of everything. Everything is a part of you. And then if you truly believe this, truly believe in integration, you would act a certain way. You would treat everything with the same respect that you perceive you would be treated with, and that you would treat yourself with, because it is all an extension of you. The bottom line is of this, that you would then not harm yourself, harm others. And if you are doing what excites you, being of service, not harming yourself, not harming others, this would only be considered to be positive into greatness. And inclusive. So I guess it would still... Oh, well, much has been communicated, both on levels, that are conscious and other levels that we communicate to you through. If, as this interaction unfolds, there is a specific nuance that you can nail down that seems to be the difficulty you are creating, please share, but also understand that it is no accident that you are here with all these other individuals. So when they ask questions, listen to those answers as well, and allow yourself to glean how those answers apply to you. And again, if the crux of what is still seeming to be a difficulty to you comes up, please share. I have one more question. How can you experience a space that has experienced a being that caught a job of cherries? Oh, like, can you speak up and be bold so that all may share? In a business space, an experience of a very bright, light, blue being that caught a self-acheries. Can you comment on that? Yes, the idea is that it is a reflection to you of a style of communication from what you might loosely label an extraterrestrial source, in that it is sourcing from other than your immediate planet, through which if you are willing to listen and interact, you can have communications. Have you engaged in a dialogue or simply received communications? I'm just giving you the idea that there is energy here. Well, I think you can define the parameters of the relationship itself, and it can be a comfortable lesson, old lost friend. That is more or less the perspective from its point of view. Therefore, begin to have casual conversation. But again, recognize that no matter how you view yourself in relation to any other energy of that nature, they view themselves as your equal. So it may simply accelerate the process to communicate with that energy as your equal. Thank you. And to you, and again, if something occurs, please share. And we thank you. Yes. I have a question. All the things that you've told people about various planets in their background and where they might have come from in lifetime path, is there some big record book that is at all in your computer somewhere? How do you know where every one of us this year tonight has come from or what our experiences have been? In general, we sense directly from you the relationships that are relevant to you at that moment and allow us to explain. You are all infinite and eternal. This means if you extrapolate it a moment, that you therefore have no beginning, no ending. Therefore, you can say quite literally, you come from everywhere and have done it all. Now, obviously being a finite idea, a pinpoint focused, this particular reality, much of it, and in fact, most of it simply has no end. And so, if it simply has no relevance to the here and now aspect that you are expressing, therefore, from our perspective, we can sense when dealing with your energy directly, what ideas are most relevant right now, and this can change? The balance is... Yes, another reason I asked the question was, I've only been at this for about a year now, all these metaphysical things. And about a year ago, we went to another person and channeling, and she said that my husband had lifetime on another planet, had great knowledge of healing, and that he and I would be working together with this music of mine to heal other people. I just wondered if you knew from what planet he came from or what other lifetime he had on another planet. What is your current understanding? What is my current? I don't know. Or was this share to that degree? No. In this instance, we simply are not picking up on anything in particular, but the idea is we also refrain in that sense from those styles, and we are not invalidating them of predictions, and simply sense a momentum that seems most likely, but again, because you have free will, that can change. How about in my own instance? Again, what is your current understanding? Or if you will be willing in that sense to share that with us, you open the door. We, 80 and his most obvious, is there another? No, I just didn't know anything about play and ease or whatever, or how that was connected with me, and I was just curious. Our simple suggestion would be that there is particular literature available upon your planet. That, in that sense, are communications from that stream. Many times, not all, there is a degree of filtering by the individual who brings it through, so simply therefore, when you are engaged in absorbing it, absorb it through your own particular filter, and allow what is relevant to you to stand out and what is relevant to simply not. Can you see us here right now? Not in the sense that you would consider to be visually. I sense you all as relationships of energy both to each other and your entire civilization. Again, we have used the analogy that if you were to view your civilization as one giant spherical crystal with many facets, we view each of you as each facet in relationship to the whole and to each other. I have just one of the quick questions. If, right now, in news, there is a lot about a doctor out west who is helping people who are terminally ill to die, and I wonder if people do do that, and we finally get it squared away in law wise or any other way, where people are allowed to take their own lines. Is that upset any kind of plan of all that is? I mean, I know suicide is never an answer to that. The idea is this may or may not sit well with you, but this will depend solely on the belief system of the individual. For all that is, or God does not judge you, it is not judgmental. Judgment is a human quality and other civilizations, but the idea is you are created in God's image, not the other way around. So therefore, the judgment that seems imposed is imposed by each individual who has their own sense of integrity and always knows on some level whether they are within that integrity or breaching that integrity. If in that sense they feel that they are truly within that integrity with their understanding, they will not create a negative effect. If they hold that they are breaching some agreement, they will create the effect of having breached the agreement. Now again, it is quite valuable from an individual to an individual. Does not breaking any great karmic law or anything by someone committing suicide or killing themselves or doing away with themselves? Well again, also understand one of the things many of your particular teachers do not share with you is karma itself. It is felt imposed and not alone. It is a particular style of balance, more or less many times when you would label a retribution style balance. Balance will be maintained and we are not saying that they will not be, but the ways to balance out energy need not by any means always be tipped for time. In other words, if you, in a sense, from your own perspective, your own set of standards do something wrong and you know what is wrong. There are many ways that you will balance out that energy. One of them is to have somebody else do that to you so that you can feel how it feels. But that is only one of them. Another way to balance it, and perhaps a bit more of a pleasant way, is next time a similar situation comes along with which you now have the option to do that out of integrity thing, simply don't do it. And in that moment you created a balance and used the very thing that you did that was out of integrity as a lesson. We think so. Wonderful. Thank you very much. And to you. Sure. Sure. You. When you were talking about abundance, you used the word need. How would you differentiate between what you need versus what you want versus what excites you in your definition of abundance? In a sense, they are interchangeable. However, perhaps the one difference is what it is you require in order to continue to do the things that you are doing versus insisting that something that you want need come right now. So the idea of what brings along with it the nuance of timing. You can have whatever you want, though not necessarily, particularly at first when you want it. Because of the idea of what you believe will be most unlikely of the unfoldment in a timeline, not because of some overall idea that you can't have it. But at first, in general, when you integrate your beliefs, you do so with some footholds and the old beliefs, and you will only do so within the acceptability of your own beliefs. So to capitalize overall, they are interchangeable. When you first begin in that sense to begin to take back your power, there is the appearances that what you want can come when you want it, but not always. There are sometimes the idea that you will impose upon yourself that you must learn certain things to be able to appreciate the thing that you want even more fully than you would right now. So to be accurate to say that abundance is the ability to choose that which will support you in continuing following your path of excitement. That will do. Thank you. My concern with the word need came from a require in order to continue to do. Yes. It was a sense of a lack versus having everything that you need with synchronicity being there. It needs to be sounded a little bit like timing was unfolding rather than the instant that you choose to move in a direction. Timing is not a prerequisite. It is a representative you choose it. Many words in your language have what you would label many meanings. And we will continue to say the ability to do what you need to do when you need to do it. Because this is what individuals perceive and understand the clearest that they need to do this. We understand that there is no overall need. You create the needs. But if you are going to create them, you can have the ability to do them when you need to. Thank you. Add you as well. Very good. Over there. Michelle, when I have heard you speak on tape, I've been very touched by the sense of love. Oh, thank you for touching yourself, by the way. I wonder if you will talk to me about how you understand the dynamics of love and what plays that dynamic or energy plays. In a person and when you see. Oh, thank you very much. First of all, understand the distinction between conditional and unconditional love. When we speak of love, we mean unconditional. No conditions. Love, no matter what. And the idea is that the primary energy of all that is, is love itself, unconditional love itself. When you speak sometimes of the white light of infinite creation, that is an unconditionally loving expression. Love is the glue that enables realities to hold together. It is the unconditional love of all that is, that enables all of creation. Therefore, you each contain being that you are made as your literature says in the image and likeness of all that is, just as much unconditional love as all that is. And therefore, when you have that feeling, you are simply in that sense experiencing something which you contain by definition for it is the essence of your soul itself as it is the essence loosely speaking of the soul so to speak of all that is itself. So therefore, it is the emotion that corresponds to your direct connection and your direct origins within all that is. Is there something else? Not now, thank you. And we thank you as well, for again. You can only feel something if you first contain it. So though you may in that sense utilize external symbols to reflect this back to you, never forget that you contain it. And what you are feeling is your version of it, which means you can muster it up at any time. Are there people who are evolved who are not loving me? In the way that you mean no, not really in the way that you mean. That's no question. Thank you. It is. I am hearing a lot of words on me. Oh, I understand I am doing that to me, but I don't know how to get rid of it. Like 80 months. Well, first of all, are you doing what excites you the most? In my job? Yes. In your life? No. Oh, through a coincidence of language, what are you waiting for? The idea is that when you are not doing what excites you the most, in a sense you are waiting around rather than doing it. When you begin to engage actively in the doing of the things that excite you with integrity, you physically move about more. Therefore, you begin to equalize and begin to be an expression of motion rather than an expression of in that sense dormancy. Does that make sense? Yes. So even physically speaking, there are two ways to approach it upon your planet. Eat less, which seems to be a bit difficult for some individuals or simply do more. Of what I like. Of what you like for that will be effortless. And you will find you are doing many things and not tired. For it is only tired to resist the things that move you. It is not tired to do that. It is quite effortless and you will find, shall we say, a reserve of inner energy that perhaps you have not experienced in a long time. But when you deny what it is that truly excites you, you do not move as much. You remain static. When you move around, you become ecstatic. I understand. I have another question. I get divorced in here and my ex-husband has appealed the decision of the girls in regards to the better one. She asked it. Everything was wrong. Is there anything I can do to bring another decision upon in my favor, and the first one was, should I just let it be? It is in the end of the entire lecture. Let it be the way it is and not do anything about it. Our simple suggestion would be to stand your ground on the one hand and on the other hand, retain your composure. This would be our strongest advice. Would you clarify that for me? Think about it. For one, see if what we are saying dawns upon you. It will become more obvious. For specific reasons we will leave it at that. But concentrate on the composure part. Simply do not allow in that sense to compromise who you are and you will put out the particular vibration. That will be more conducive for the result that you seek. For now, trust us. My last question, my grandmother passed away this past Sunday. She died and I did not accomplish going to see her. It is in another country, a country, a country. I promised her to go back here and see her before she died. But I didn't do that. I didn't do the commitment that I made to her. I was an easy about the situation, but I had come to get the situation complete. I saw my grandmother and spoke to her. All very good. I feel good about that. But I still question two things. My mother is in our meeting and I was touching her here. For so many times she wanted me to touch her straight here. She had never seen the light that she would come to her hair tight. But in our meeting she had a loose and she wanted me to touch her hair. So that's one question I have. Is there a meaning to that? Oh yes. But we will allow you to explore the meaning and simply add to this. From the perspective of having transformed in that way, when you soften your focus as you die as you say. There is an overall understanding of certain ideas that while you are alive, you have a tunnel vision or a narrowness to not perceive. What we are saying is that she understands from where she is sitting so to speak. She understands you are not being physically able to be there. There is no love lost. And the willingness from your part, from your perspective, from your heart to engage with trust in post-transformative or after-death. Communication with her is greatly appreciated. Simply trust what you get from her and understand, though again we will leave this to you, that the touching of the hair in that fashion was quite an intimate, trustful thing. In a sense relating to the idea of her letting down her guard for you and being that open. Yes. She died without being able to tell us how old she was. So we don't know how old she was. We get maybe 102 years old. She didn't know when she was born. She didn't know how to read or write. She had no record. Can you tell me what was her age when she died? Her perspective and again it is only our perspective is 103. Thank you. And you as well. Sure. Okay, I'll play after meeting. What craft circles I've heard recently that certain Native Americans are saying that they are communicating with us that the Mother Earth is crying. Could you give us some insight into what they're all about and what we're trying to learn from them? Our perspective is that they are direct communication from what you would label to be extra terrestrial sources. Although understand a proportion or a portion of them are, shall we say, copy text. The idea is there will be particular ones in general. If you were to compile shall we say a list of pictures of them that have particular qualities that are less apt to be able to have been copied. If you begin to compile these and focus upon them in a sense you may call them pictographs. And there is an elaborate code within them. But the timing of the unfoldment of the deciphering of that code will have much to do with your own individual and collective personal unfoldments. For again, it is all a matter of timing. But in a sense you may say it is a greeting card of sorts. Could you tell us what they're saying to us? The reason being is that there will be a particular intensive style of joy in that discovery. And the willingness of your civilization to take the steps to decipher it is in a sense symbolically representative of meeting us halfway. Therefore not asking us to do it for you being willing to take responsibility for the interaction. Okay, thank you. I hear a lot about us as we evolved into the fifth dimension living in light bodies. Does this mean that we will no longer be in the physical body? Our perspective of the definition of fifth density, and these are varying densities of consciousness to from more compact consciousness to more diffuse so to speak in the physical sense. Our particular definition of fifth density is the first level, if you will, that your vibration in a sense increases to that would be considered non-physical. Again, well this is a nuclear proliferation of radioactivity, have anything to do with facilitating our evolution and species and perhaps to our light bodies because it adjusts the atomic structure. There are certain individuals that may avail themselves of that idea, but overall that is more the exploration of personal and collective integrity. When we began in the beginning of this interaction to state that there is a particular gateway through which it becomes more conducive to do what excites you with integrity and that which you do which is not representative of integrity and not representative of who you are will fall apart more quickly, there will be some blatant examples of this fall in the part more quickly when particular individuals will insist on doing things with that medium so to speak. That is out of integrity, in other words there may be a few of what you would label from that perspective allow us to scan for language. Negative seeming events which in and of themselves will be localized and not allow individuals out of integrity to perpetuate this style of exploration. In other words, the actions that you are speaking of will result in particular but affects what will bring everything out into the open and allow the people as a whole to decide. Thank you very much and to you. Also, if I am observing myself in the gathering to change, certain things will come up and I will see in myself thoughts or feelings and that I would think, oh I don't like that, I don't want it. Is there a way to at that moment, I sometimes almost wish that I could have just disintegrate in front of me and that it says you can't. And then it no longer exists, like I say, oh I have that thought that I don't like that in myself, I see it, I don't want it functioning that way. I see it dematerialized before me at this moment and it no longer exists, it is no longer mine and I am clear of that from now on. Allow us again to draw the distinction that being the entire universe, there is no where, there is no outside to get rid of anything too. So the idea of instant, shall we say, change in result, is the integration of that idea. And when you find yourself with one of these notions, again, emotions are always directly the result of a belief. If you feel that way and you do not wish to feel that way, ask yourself, what do I believe to be feeling that? When you get the belief you'll go, ah, I do believe that, don't like it, but I believe it, alright, alright, I admit it. You now admit it meaning what yourself is to what you truly believe. If you sit and reflect and extrapolate, you can say, okay, since I believe that and allow myself to feel this way, what have been my actions. Then use your imagination to draw up what the actions would be of an individual who believed the thing you would prefer to believe, compare those actions to the actions you are performing and it will be quite obvious how you can change immediately, how you can take the new actions each and every time that comes up and get the preferable result, then you will have a meaning of change. I'm scheduled to give a presentation concerning nuclear information and I would like to ask you what would best serve the evolution of our species and the upliftment of the inner lioness? I would like to ask you what would best serve the evolution of our species and the upliftment of the inner lioness with what you've been teaching us in relation to this subject. In an unconditionally loving way, without accusing or blaming, point out what you feel to be ideas that are out of integrity and provide alternatives. What people can do, actually do.
