 All right, I'll say I bid you greetings this evening of your time as you create time to exist and I welcome you all to a session which if you wish you may entitle the beginning. Thank you for being willing to applaud yourselves in what is truly your own beginning. You understand the following. We have discussed with you many times over many different interactions over what you call the last several years of communicating with your society in this way. The mechanisms through which you already express yourself as conscious being, the mechanisms through which you express. You'll create a force to create what you call your lives. It has been discussed many times between you the idea that you do indeed have something to do with creating your own life, creating your own reality. In interacting with you we have reinforced this idea and perhaps enhanced it to include the idea that you actually created all no exceptions. You do so through a very finely honed mechanism that has become what you call second nature to yourself and that you are not even always aware that you are doing so. And perhaps one of the main contributions that we have made when discussing these ideas with you is the idea that simply being aware of how you already create your reality gives you the opportunity to change that reality if you so desire and for any reason are not satisfied with where you are at. Not needing to learn anything new but using the same mechanism that you already have always used to create your lives and your reality and your experience in this way. Simply we have discussed that generally speaking you do this in three stages or steps although this is truly an expression of one idea. It can be broken down for easily understanding it to the idea of number one. In each and every moment you always decide who you are. Perhaps you can say you set up a premise. Number two you trust this decision about yourself or another way to put that is you maintain that decision constantly reaffirming it constantly remaining committed to that idea. Number three is you then act or perform an action or have an experience or in some way. In that sense output into your reality utilizing the decision about who you are as a foundational premise and the trust and maintenance of that decision as a foundation. This is what you already do. You already always have and will continue to the idea being that when the decision itself is random when you allow it to seem to be dictated to you then the results seem random and your reality and the results and experience of your reality would seem to be dictated to you. However now we introduce and have been introducing the idea of as you say consciously making that decision about who you are not dictated to by any set of circumstances or individuals who have you so labeled in a particular way but making that decision consciously according to your own understanding of who it is you prefer to be according to your own understanding of perhaps what you may refer to as your ideal version of yourself which as any other version of yourself also exists and as a proof that it exists your ability to imagine it your ability to even see what it might be like your ideal self tells you in no uncertain terms that that ideal self does exist because you simply cannot imagine non-existence go ahead and try. Therefore understand in no uncertain terms that you're willing that to define this is who I am because this is who I wish to be this is who I am because this is what I see as the vision for myself allows you to register who you are rather than have that experience of who you are seem to be random. All of these discussions that we have had for these many years have in this sense reinforced mainly the idea we have just discussed we have called it different things you have used different definitions to allow you to define yourself but more or less it boils down to decision trust and action and perhaps being that we have in that sense persisted in having these communications occur between us for so long and so often may leave you with a feeling or thought that once I have in that sense made my decision conscious accomplish that decision according to who I am created the foundational template for the life that I prefer that I am there that it is the end of the process no the idea is from one point of view that once you have the tools readily at your disposal and are in that sense willing to utilize them to apply them truly consistently utilizing who you are this is truly the beginning of your conscious life and not in any way shape or form the destination or ending so we introduced this simple concept of the beginning so that you can in that sense feel the end of your decision about who you are a freshness a newness because although you are an eternal being and although you have existed always in that sense you will never quite be the exact version of yourself in the same circumstance that you are right now and so in each and every moment truly you are renewed you are a new if you will often when discussing with you what you call the turning of your year the entering into your new year we will from time to time provide labels for what you may understand will be the overall energetic experience gateway or doorway within an upcoming year of your time and so understanding that this is the precipice between what you refer to as your 1996 and your year 1997 you may understand that from our perspective your year of 1997 will truly be a year of renewal the idea being that you will reestablish you will recommit yourself you will repurcify if you are so inclined your commitment about who you are and begin to see in a very blatant way as you say across the board obvious evidence and effects that your decision about yourself your positive decision if you are willing to persist with it has stuck and that the reality around you begins to really seem to be a one-two-one reflection of your positive decision as we have discussed with you when your decision suddenly becomes conscious after being unconscious or random for all these years there may seem to be a period of transition where even though you have shifted your decision your outer evidence may still seem or look similar to the evidence that the old you would have gotten in effect even though this may seem to negate the change in your decision this is your very opportunity to really truly register your decision and prove that you have indeed committed to that decision by being willing to look at any evidence that comes along and looks as old evidence through the new eyes of the new decision and that is what allows the effect of any seeming old evidence to be new effects to have different outcomes for it is not truly any circumstance that causes or results in anything in your life it is your interpretation of a circumstance of an experience through whatever your point of view is and then your assessment of meaning to that particular event and then you then act accordingly or respond accordingly to whatever that premise is and so if the situation remains the same on the surface but your approach toward the situation is completely different only only can you get a different result and so this is what makes the change in your life being willing to maintain the decision particularly at first when you decide to make it in the face of any other seeming contradictory evidence and in fact using any seeming contradictory evidence which are truly a neutral set of props from the new point of view and again when you are beginning to establish who you are decide who you are in conscience we stated everything that happens to you from that point forward can only be a reflection of that decision no matter how it appears so if it appears as old evidence where something is happening to you your particular opportunity to transform its effect upon you or the effect that you create from it can simply occur from not being willing to accept that it is the old idea not being willing to accept that it is evident contrary to your decision but asking yourself in very sincere terms how is this of service to me even though it looks like old evidence how is this of service to the new me how can I use it it is obvious what seems negative about it but it is a package deal there are other aspects about the evidence that I can now interpret and actually see what is the advantage in them being there in exactly the way that they are so your system of interpretation as it changes so will your response and when your response embodies your new decision no matter what the circumstance that you are responding to is you can only get the result of the new preferred you and so therefore establishing who you are is by no means in any way shape or form the end of a process and in fact is the beginning of the process so to speak truly there is no longer even the necessity for a process because once you decide who you are and are willing to express yourself as that being consciously from this point forward you remain very highly focused in the moment and are so busy dealing at that self with whatever is right in front of you that you do not have time to plan ahead and lament behind all of which were in that sense approaches of the old you anyway and so therefore have no place being in the moment with your intentions being in the moment with your interpretations and your actions truly allows you to let go of any so-called baggage and simply express yourself as the being you prefer right now even though there is the apparent that there may be some lingering evidence from the old you truly in the moment that you decide who you are you are already that person and it is only an apparent this evidence catching up because of the tendency to interpret circumstance through the old eyes simple reminders to yourself simply allowing yourself to literally renew your decision about who you are is what allows you to quickly move beyond this and transform it so that even the evidence catches up with the decision on a very visible and obvious level so these are the things that you are now either beginning to experience or will be beginning to experience shortly if you are indeed willing to remain committed to who you are and again though others other individuals other circumstances other feedback will constantly give you the opportunity to take their opinion about who you are I remind you in no uncertain terms that no matter what only you know you anyone else is simply guessing and building up their version of you that serves whatever they are exploring so it is up to you to maintain who you are and if someone else should give you a very compelling argument for why you're truly not that person only you know who you are and until and unless you agree with their argument and then shift your decision you truly are a new person in every given moment when you are willing to embrace everything in every moment with more of the attitude and more of the interpretation of it being brand new a new beginning fresh then you can continually generate the excitement that the discovery of new things brings along with it and when you allow unexpected evidence to simply be icing on the cake simply be the spice and use it to enhance the flavor of the situation rather than to drag yourself back down you can be consciously using everything in your creation to support who you are understand this is a very exciting time both individually and collectively for you and the members of your society next year as you say sensing the energy available right now if nothing is to change which of course it can because there is no prediction of the future only sensing of energy in place at the moment but there is a high degree of likelihood that next year will be a very exciting and active year in your lives there will be what you call great change and there will most likely be what you call some tumultuous transformation though that is not likely to take place in your part of the world because of your global communications you will be quite aware of everything that is going on no matter what happens it is my strong suggestion that you are willing to maintain who you are that you are willing to build into your decision your own contribution which often will consist of unconditional love and peace of mind as you are willing to be the vibration of unconditional love as you are willing to be the vibration of peace of mind anything else that you perceive externally will in that sense fall into place anything else that you perceive to be happening in your world will follow where you are going no matter who you are and what you do and although this seems like a paradox it is nonetheless true and so therefore keep your eyes open next year and in that sense if you are willing to allow the transformation rather than in that sense assume you must resist it it will be quite effortless it will be quite automatic and you will not in any way shape or form experience anything but the unconditional love joy and ecstasy that you will experience once you are willing to put that out and so therefore you will all act perhaps you can say in a certain way as a type of pressure valve which will allow these circumstances to play out in the least of negative terms this was not that likely but two or three of your years ago and a grand shift has occurred which means that the tumultuous shift that we speak of next year of your time may indeed be far less severe than was originally anticipated because of the shifting energy and for that we thank you not because we have any invested interest in any outcome but simply because when you do choose positivity when you do choose unconditional love you shine as more of a like vibration that we can perceive and as we have said the possibility exists for us to interact with you face to face perhaps not for what you call ten years of your time but as you are willing to maintain who you are and live in such a way where your vibration is literally raised by your willingness to align with many of the ideas that we are sharing not because they are better but simply because it is your timing this allows us each to perceive each other physically in a more concrete sense for I remind you even though it is your perception that I am a person speaking to you as a person and this is true in the ultimate sense our particular society our particular physicality is indeed different from yours vibrate if you will at a different rate and without adjustment from what you call consciousness which can also take the form of what you call technology we are literally invisible to each other at the present time ironically enough a shift in your own personal attitude changes your whole entire frequency or vibration and this is all it takes in that sense for us to be able to enjoy such blatant face to face interactions which are again a distinct possibility within the next decade of your time if things stay in the way that they are for your willingness to interact with me and members of my civilization I impart to you the most deeply and heartfelt and sincere appreciation and thank you for the idea is that we gain very much from these interactions and interacting with you to us is a great joy a great gift many of the things that you are willing to share with us are things that we do not explore in our civilization in our society and therefore by being able to perhaps temporarily perhaps momentarily see reality through your eyes we learn more about ourselves for just in the way that I have shared with you that reality exists within you this is true regardless of how paradoxical it sounds for each and every individual everyone perceives that reality is merging into them this is part of the paradox of a finite existence within an infinity of consciousness therefore from my point of view one way to look at it is that you all exist within me you are all reflections of me and because many of the approaches of members of your society differ greatly from our particular societal approach I can learn about different aspects of myself that are not necessarily available in the day to day happening upon my planet in my society we cherish this and we thank you very much for your willingness to function in this way obviously I also function this way for you as well for anything that you feel inspires you in these interactions already existed within you to begin with and in fact if it did not you would simply make no sense of it therefore whenever you have a spark of recognition of revelation and inspiration pat yourself on the back no matter where it seems to come from it is only a reflection of something that must first exist within you otherwise it would make no sense to you only can you understand something if you first contain it as a notion to begin with and conveniently being fundamentally infinite beings you contain it all anyway the point of these statements is that when you are willing to assign the credit back to yourself this has an effect of being willing to honor and reinforce yourself and the effect of being willing to be most responsible for being who you are most fully for that we thank you I now ask you how we may mutually be of service to each other in a more direct way through the segments of our interactions we refer to as the sharing my one of the hottest topics on the metaphysical internats websites these days has to do with extraterrestrial face-to-face interactions oh honey there have been a lot of things that have been called by attention lately as you know I could come up with a big Courtney Brown fan previous discussions Courtney's website is filled with allusions to the year 1997 and interesting events that are going to be taking place regarding Zeta reticulums and Martians and volcanoes and presidential disclosure how it's not sources of other things oh right here's that one end of the spectrum and then on the other end of the spectrum our references that both you and Vishar have made that perhaps you know our society perhaps me individually for that matter and I'm not quite ready for that type of interaction I just want to ask you what your perception of the energies at this time were and also specifically in reference to Courtney Brown and some of his research utilizing his remote viewing what do you think about the substance of his research as well first of all understand that what you can expect is perhaps more than you thought you were ready for but less than perhaps has been stated somewhere in the middle something along these lines will occur but I will not say what for that would be a disservice in terms of the value of what you call remote viewing it can be very precise it can be very precise and it will be filtered and it will simply depend upon the individuals involved their agenda but mostly their trust in what they're doing and their trust in themselves to interpret what they're doing with the least amount of color in other words what you refer to as remote viewing does have a similar phenomenon that is generally referred to in channeling as filter if indeed an individual were truly attuned willing to trust and factor out what you call opinion there can be a very precise measurement that takes place by those means for it is simply expanding your consciousness consciously to encompass more of physical reality whereby that then seems to give you the ability to be other places in a sense you are literally being those places rather than going to them is there something specific you are seeking in this thing well yeah specifically what group of interactions are most likely to take places the upcoming years involving which extraterrestrial species and to what degree would have been the idea is that I will simply put it the following way when your society interacts with what you call extraterrestrials in a blatant and open way there is a degree of likelihood now I understand that that is not a committed term but again here is where your free will comes into it and even hearing this can shift your decision there is a high degree of likelihood that the first interaction will be with the beings that are being referred to as the zeta or gray that is as much as I will say along those lines two Mars pros that should be transmitting information back sometime around the 4th of July 1997 what is it what is the likelihood of having a clear transmission there is a high degree of likelihood of having a clear transmission as this would be in very many ways in ideal timing it will depend upon sociological events upon your planet from now to then however and literally are more dependent on what is going on that day than any discussion we are having right now the idea is that as it stands now there will not be interference with these crowds interference from the perspective of you know our government releasing that information you have built in what you call perhaps a nice safety valve in the installation of your system of global communication you refer to as the internet it is my perception that there will be direct transmission available from that network in other words as the craft is actually transmitting you will be able in that sense to see the pictures somewhat speaking lies there is a delay if this phase in place that is as it is now planned it will minimize any likelihood of what you call intervention but understand in more ways than you might imagine it would be who those in power to allow this information by and you will perhaps find their willingness to do so may seem to have changed in understanding it only empowers you as a society and as individuals to become aware of more of the galaxy more of in that sense your own perhaps you can say all right cosmic neighborhood there has been what you call the notion that you could not handle this and in many ways societally perhaps that was true until recently however because of what you call your media because of what you call your entertainment industry and the many different gradients of exposure to the possibility of contact with extraterrestrial races that your society has gotten a chance to try on through your technology and so forth has truly served as a buffer and individuals will be far more receptive than perhaps in that sense you would have imagined but even five to ten of your years ago so everything in that sense is lining up in a very exciting way so this is the media and the entertainment industry is still you know broadcasting a lot of this information from a fear based are you really that's the prime well understand the following let us factor out what you refer to continually as governmental manipulation and let us simply factor in the way that your entertainment industry bases its successes statistically speaking what you call negativity gets more attention than positivity not only is this true and what you call your movies what you call your television what you may call your radio but this is also true in the factual sense in what you call your news each and every day upon your planet there are as many perhaps more accurately more positive things done by individuals coming to each other's assistance banding together for several different causes in that way expressing their power and yet the perception of the industry is that that is not so called news worthy and so therefore is it not surprising in a more broader sense that your entertainment industry does the same as well this also is prone to shift and to some degree has begun to already aliens with ray guns are very popular I will allow you to write the specifics I cannot confirm that for very specific reason and all right that will do for a stop is that all oh shit oh hi oh excited one yeah if you say so I I have a question but before I ask my question I want to just take a little bit all right may I ask you one first are you beginning to do more of what excites you are you finding that many of the other things that we discussed in terms of discomfort are beginning to resolve particularly while you are engaged with the exciting thing yes oh thank you do proceed I mean I've even had an hour to where the pain that I experienced in my body is not even thought about it oh get used to that yes I can oh I would like to understand if I'm making choices for instance I have a negative aspect that you would spoken about having an idea that negative aspect and then looking at the opposite of that and then making for instance the idea is being that when a so-called negative thought or option occurs to you sometimes individuals say one of the voices within me said this but the idea is to remind yourself a it is only an option no matter whether it seems to have the power to generate negative emotionality and be posed at least one alternative so that realizing you're going to choose one of them you give yourself a positive useful productive choice with a particular individual that we were discussing it with we went one step further to say in providing an option provide the exact opposite of the disempowered thought to simply give focus and to simply give polarity and to simply allow the negative choice to stand out very very brightly in relief for when you provide yourself a positive and negative alternative and truly remind yourself that they are choices and you will choose one anyway it becomes far simpler to choose the positive and if it is directly opposite of the negative it is the polar positive do proceed well I and I really feel that I am doing that oh congratulations and I feel real strong about that I also in terms of the situation that I've been dealing with for the first time I really see the gift in it I couldn't for a long time to say how to observe me because when I did I got angry before you proceed were what you call your physical pain to have abated earlier would that not in that sense have resulted in you not coming to that recognition yes oh do proceed yes so that it's the gift of this it's really I don't like to use the word but feeling what I know forced me to really choose what it is that most means what it is that excites me and out of that enjoying the process of that as well as doing what's available in any given moment that's exciting to me so I still would like to understand why you know a time like I look at all that I've done all that I've worked through my journaling which helps me every day has changed dramatically in the past month and a half oh perhaps the missing piece of the puzzle is simply this it is an assumption it is an assumption that there is just one thing that you will realize that will then allow the idea to play out now first of all it will play out by choosing something else as we have discussed but each time for any reason you feel in this case pain it has a different reason than any other moment you have ever felt it there is the key if you come up with any explanation that you have already come up with that's not the explanation if you are willing to look around and to remind yourself that this particular sensation is occurring in this moment it is unique to this moment no matter what I did yesterday the day before no matter if this feels similar or different it is this moment that the meaning lies within and the meaning will be different than it ever have been in any other moment do you see the distinction yes I do and I that is the hope and I also I can like feel what you're saying when you do what I am saying you will find the quick transformation of the pain for each time you give it the same meaning you do not allow us to deliver it moment specific message and that is why it lingers in the most fundamental sense so be willing to be more open minded and in that sense more exploratory in what it means to you in a given moment but not compared to any other pain you've had before only in that moment perhaps as an aid picturing that you have never had that before I'm having a little difficulty understanding what you're saying oh if you are right now sitting here and suddenly became in pain then you would ask yourself all right I feel this and it's not something I prefer in fact I choose wellness and feeling well however in this particular moment I'm sitting in this chair I have this person next to me that person next to me this person in front of me I am doing this right now what does this pain mean to me right now what does it tell me right now what does it force me to look at right now having nothing to do with yesterday yesterday's pain this is different what is it what's in the moment that is all I am saying the willingness to do that will bring up a surprise which is not visible when you search with old eyes right okay now I understand I think I've been doing that I think you have been doing it you have not been doing it all right when you do it you'll know it you on the shadow of a doubt and again I proceed you will do this from this point forward which is all that matters if you choose to I am not telling you to know I'm telling you something I just want to share something all right my dad's 82 congratulations and he's a great guy and of course being around me you've been exposed to a lot of things and for many years he refused to you know he didn't believe in it but the other day he said to me for the first time he said I really don't think I want a meeting extra extraterrestrial on a dark road alone at night would be quite a lot of fun but he is waiting and it was first time he actually said something he was willing to acknowledge that there was something here all right well allow him to know that in general the illumination from our craft make it seem as though it is day right thank you as much shitty mail I guess the question that I wanted to ask if there was one thing that the reason why we are still here is the as a human beings that we need to learn is that a specific this particular point in time not from my perspective for my perspective is not that you are here to learn I understand that that is a popular way to interpret yourself and to interpret that indeed you start out less you gain you gather you accumulate knowledge resources timing and then lo and behold you are more that is an illusion remember fundamentally you are an infinite all-knowing being that is already complete and already contains it all and perhaps our particular explanation for why you are here is not to accomplish anything to learn anything to work through anything but only only only because it is available as an option in other words because it is there and it is the type of thing that your particular shall I say nuance of consciousness or soul was attracted to to express yourself in these terms which may seem limited but allow you to focus on specific things and experience the expression of yourself in these terms when you in that sense translate or what you call physically die you immediately become a more aware of more of yourself and you immediately understand that what you seem to have learned and gained in this life were things you already knew had imposed a forgetfulness upon yourself so that you can experience them from a slightly different point of view with a slightly different nuance as you say in your society you have a penchant for saying and expressing an appreciation for the first time there is nothing like the first time you say the paradox is that forgetfulness allows you to experience things as if for the first time and in fact if you express yourself as an all-knowing being already you could not have that particular experience you could not see things as if for the first time nothing would surprise you you could never seem to learn you could never seem to discover so these are the prerequisites to the joy of discovery the joy of learning the joy of unexpected outcomes and the appearances of expansion the appearances of growing into more than you are more accurately you are expanding into more of what you already are you are expanding your recognition about what is already true about yourself we share this with you not to confuse you or invalidate your purpose in life if it has been for this growth but to allow you to see that you already have access to all of it when you go on the assumption that you must learn and you build that as a strong premise you withhold things from yourself unless you have in some logical way learn them and so you shut off your intuition in the deepest sense you shut off your access into more of your great wisdom so by all means you can continue to go about thinking that your soul has a particular job it does that job and it graduate but the idea is that you are assuming a structure a hierarchy which does not truly exist because you are the creator and we mean that literally and again the paradox is that that is true for each and every one of you and to each and every one of you it seems like you are the only creator this is one of the slender paradoxes of finite reality that exists within infinite consciousness does this help or completely confuse the matter well it does help us at a point do we other in other words rather than having to learn and become more or better it is simply your opportunity right now to express as much or more of yourself as you are willing and begin to reap consciously the experience right now what changes the assumptions what changes the assumptions that a person has simply coming into awareness of assumptions that are more preferable and plugging them in for again an assumption is another way to say a decision I have made this decision this is what I assume will happen but as we now have the opportunity to share this with you how would we know that there would be more assumptions that could be changed I remind you that I am simply one reflection and that when you are willing in that sense to expose or express or experience more of yourself and you're still coming from the premise that you're in a reality that happens to you you will do it by external reflection therefore were you not to have attracted the synchronicity of this interaction you would have attracted something else picked up a book picked up what you call your newspaper turned on your television had a conversation with a stranger that you've never met when you are ready to express more of yourself you will attract the path of least resistance which ironically is this in your case to reflect that back to yourself and so always will there be what you need there even if you're not aware of it but when you are you can facilitate this is one of the reasons that we say that it is not important to us in any way shape or form that anyone believe anything that we say because it is we that say it and by all means if something that we said does not work for you you will find something else it is simply the law of your own attraction is this true also linearly speaking linearly in time is this this to be true in our so-called past or the teachers such as you available in the past there have been reflections in very many forms throughout your history less from what you call an extra terrestrial point of view but understand that there are many humans walking around with much of the same ideology that I share with you and that is what has at least provided in your language the vocabulary to communicate it unless you say so in which case you will experience the appearance of isolation but even that is an appearance as well thank you I have done nothing you've done it all my perfection to yourself thank you shilling may reading and to you where are you this evening? I am for myself where are you I assume you are upon your home world yes ah turning it around it just so happens that I am in your neighborhood at this time I am within what you would call your solar system I am upon my scout craft with two other individuals I am in that sense performing a particular observation that I will not discuss will that suffice no your boy has changed I just do oh so you ended up with a subject that you brought up apparently until you brought it back up you ask my question oh what? you do not have to ask if you cannot simply proceed would you please tell us about light the nature of light is purpose and meaning you think we depend how you mean that term now in a very perhaps you can say ultimate sense the energy of creation can be seen or understood to express itself as a white light much of this is arbitrary however because light is a far broader form of energy than what you call simply your visible spectrum of light your visible spectrum of light is simply one life from perhaps you can say the overall bandwidth if you will of light of infinite creation light that we sometimes refer to as the light of all that is or the light of God does have a physical bandwidth but extends beyond that physical bandwidth in both directions reaching its fingers perhaps you can say to whatever degree this will make sense and translation into non-physical reality into infinite reality so light would also seem to exist so to speak as a pervasive element in the infinite as well as the finite what you generally refer to as white light which would seem to be the combination of all the different types of light to you is again a very fine bandwidth a very fine perceptive sense on your end to be able to interpret that bandwidth in a particular way does this help yes do you and Estesani have visible to you more than the spectrum of light than we do and so do you see different colors to some degree yes so this would not translate into your language for you do not have in that sense vocabulary for perhaps you can understand that our sensitivities are a little bit above a little bit below what you call the visible spectrum of light from your perspective although if we were interacting with you the adjustments that we would make would have us being similar thing our scientists we believe that light is of a dull nature it is far more than that but it can be perceived in either one of those states when you in that sense attached to it the variable you call time we think of it as both particles but also in a wave form both of these only making sense in linear reality yes you are describing what you would perhaps call an infinite idea and finding different. Oh I think of light as transmitting you said energy maybe also information. It need not necessarily be perceived as being transmitting in the infinite sense there is no transmitter and receiver for these are linear ideas it is simply infinite multi-dimensional and eternal as are you all. We enter spirit form non-physical when you shift your perspective to no longer seem to express yourself through a physical body yes proceed. Oh you will assist the channel in washing his hands when you are through. You have a fascinating language. You will perceive yourself in ways that are similar to the way you perceive yourself right now because of your close association with this type of pinpoint consciousness there are versions of yourself where you can see in that sense to experience yourself as perhaps you would say a spark but a spark implies a very small pinpoint of light and size has no meaning at that point so it would appear from your perspective to be an infinite spark. I heard somebody whether it was Bishar or you where somebody described that they could see with their eyes open that's a little sparks of light in their vision and somehow the idea was oh well those are entities that sound familiar. That is one way to look at it I understand what you are saying and this can have a multitudinous number of causes. We believe that the speed of light is always constant throughout the universe if you agree with that is that important that it is that way. I do not necessarily agree with that though in what you would call your neighborhood it would apply for now. I think the sea word serves as a reference to our scientists but is there any other purpose? Do you understand that some of the characteristics that you are speaking about only become true when you label them in that way and then when you change your perception so do the so-called laws also seem to change because you are now focusing on different aspects of the same reality. One more aspect of this thing. It depends how you mean. If you were to transmit electricity through what you call space yes when you in that sense introduce what you call a resistor which can be even a wire or cable no. You will often tell us that you tell us what we are able to handle at any given time. Is there anything more about like you want to tell us right now? You are full of it. And perhaps but several days ago you would not have been able to handle it. I think there is a call for that and all the time. Oh I guess you insist. I meant it that way as well. Thank you very much. Oh I have done nothing. Thank you. See you. I will not force you to have too much fun. Do you wish to interact? Yes. Thank you. Proceed. As you are breathing. I have three questions. The first one is about love. Oh. I wonder if you can. Well personally when I do not feel loved I feel extremely depleted and when I shine. Why do you do that to yourself? Well we have. In other words what I mean by that is when you say you do not feel loved I remind you. Make your ability to perceive something be as good as your ability and willingness to put that out. And so when you are willing to unconditionally love yourself. Not love yourself if you do this and that only. Then you will only feel that from others no matter what they seem to put out because you will know the fundamental truth is that that is the stuff in that sense that reality is made of. In other words if you say to me I do not feel loved I say to you then you are choosing in that moment to not love yourself or to love yourself with a condition that you have not fulfilled. Well I agree with you and that is my problem. My problem is that. By the way you have no problem. Simply a situation that you have not allowed to transform. You are discussing it now and entertaining the idea to transform it. So no problem at all. So I am ready to I would like a tool to take me to transform that place if I do not feel loved and I know in a higher state when I get into a meditation and I am in that blissful place that is only about love. May I ask you a question. Do you wish to be loved in each and every moment? I wish to love myself in each and every moment. All right. Do you wish to be loved in each and every moment? Yes. Then love yourself in each and every moment. And I am not being fictitious. I am not being sarcastic. I am not even displaying irony at least not for a moment. But the idea is it is that simple. Allowing yourself by simply reminding yourself oh yes I love myself. I've forgotten I remind myself is all there is to it. Well I did that tonight as I was doing dishes and realized I really was not in a place of feeling very lovable. And I looked in the window and saw my reflection and I tried. I do understand that insisting that you must be lovable to be loved is a condition. Unconditional love means I love myself no matter what. Well I'm doing things I don't like right now. So I'm doing things that perhaps I wish I were doing. So I'm doing what I was doing. My point is when I said that I didn't feel it. So I'm trying to figure out how do I get to the feeling. What did you feel? I just love myself. So then you didn't truly make the decision. You act as though there is a two years going on here and there is truly one year. And the you that says I don't feel it is the same you that would say well I don't need to feel it I know it's there I've decided I love myself. And perhaps in the state I may not feel it but it doesn't change my commitment. And it doesn't change my decision that I will settle for nothing less than my own love. So even though I feel something else in that moment that's just. Well let us say this. You say I love myself. Then you feel something. That something can be what we have referred to in the beginning of this interaction as evidence to the contrary. Certainly if that's how you label it and that's how you treat it then it will seem to be. But if you say well I don't feel it. And that would seem to be evidence to the contrary but wait a minute I am looking at that evidence through old eyes. I know I have just chosen to love myself. I know I can do that without condition. And now I also know that I can love myself and still feel this way in this moment. It is not preferable to me I would prefer to feel that love but I know that it is possible to still feel this way and yet still renew my commitment to love myself. That is what will shift it. If you say there is the evidence I must not love myself you then don't continue to assign that self love and so you then don't feel it. But there may be an interface, a threshold at which you make that decision. Do not feel that and then it is up to you to interpret that circumstance and you can't interpret it by saying oh it's interesting. I don't feel it but that doesn't change my decision. And if you change your decision it is not truly the feeling that changes. It was your very rigid interpretation and insistence that it means that and then making the new decision and therefore I must not love myself because I didn't feel it. The understanding of the distinction it has to do with persistence and commitment to the decision no matter what. And by the way as a fringe benefit when you do that you will feel it. Maybe not on the first or second time or third time but if you simply decide you love yourself and have no conditions not even that it must feel a certain way you will get the benefits of that love. The emotional, the spiritual, the physical benefits of that love. Also then that will reinforce your willingness to express unconditional self love which paradoxically is the only thing that will make it seem as though suddenly others love me so much. Does that make sense? And that was only the first question number two. The second question I related to this I have a very uncomfortable shoulder which has bonded me for a very long time and I've lost his health from different people. Now symbolically and you will understand immediately what I am saying. You do have a tendency to do what is called in your society bear the weight of others upon your shoulders. Oh there's your symbol. I am aware of it. You do it you're aware of it now what will you decide. Will you notice when you're bearing that weight will you understand that that's taking responsibility for them rather than to them will you allow yourself to shift yourself to be responsible to them and allow them to be responsible for themselves when you do that the shoulder will seem to subside. I guess what I've been doing is when I get to that awareness and think I've done it and then feel the shoulder cracking and hurting I go well it didn't work. Well there you go you take evidence interpret it through all the eyes make a new decision that looks exactly like the old one and the appearances that nothing has changed in fact it has and you have gone on a little ride. What's happening is I'm trying to learn an instrument a heart. Why are you trying rather than simply learning? I'm learning. Always think. And the prerequisite is that your arms are in such a position that it really is very difficult for a man, you know a shoulder. Well then you have a lot of incentive to stop carrying around other people's weight. And in fact upon doing so not only will you have what you call the subciting of the pain but you will also have what you call perhaps the music of the angel. Nice touch. Number three. Number three was the side of not been able to afford or felt like going on vacation in many many years. I thought maybe you could like take us on and I just feel like it's chasing. Notice how the individual asked the question in which I cannot fulfill the answers. Do pursue this. Is there any chance that you could take us on a little journey tonight? Yeah, let's go. That's a body or your face factor really anywhere. Not the seasoning of your time. The reason being that there is an essential shall I say focus on remaining grounded so that you can in that sense walk very firmly into what you call your coming year. That will be a possibility next year of your time. Okay. How about a grounding? By the way never would be performed to fulfill even the mildest need for an escape for an individual for that is exactly opposite of what we discussed in terms of reinforcing your empowerment. Okay. What's the vacation? Is it not like a little bit in this game from just going on around you right now? That is completely up to you but were you to ask me to take you on a vacation to get away from it I would say no. Okay. So can you do something to ground up? Have been the entire interaction and we'll continue to do so. Thank you very much. Thank you. After timing we will pause for what you call a break of your own choosing in terms of timing and resume contact upon your request.
