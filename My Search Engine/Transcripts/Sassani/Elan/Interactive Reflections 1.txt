 We think this evening of your time, how are you all? Are you all awake? Oh thank you very much. Allow me to begin this interaction with the entitlement. Interactive reflections. First of all, there is a common notion upon your planet, in your society. It is by the way not unique to your society, but a bit shall we say rare in the overall scheme of things from our perspective. And this is the notion that your life happens to you, that you exist within a life. One of the things that it is our pleasure in that sense to share with you, is that from again our perspective, more appropriately, could you consider that your life does not so much happen to you, but actually through you or from you. Another way to put this is, again sometimes you believe that you exist within a reality. And that is one perspective, one particular point of view. But another point of view, perhaps you can say a bit more of an expensive point of view, is that the reality exists within you. Anything that you perceive to be external to you is literally existing within you. And therefore again from the perspective of seeming to exist within it, all the external ideas, all the external events, all the external places, all the external seeming people, are but reflections of ideas within your overall consciousness. Therefore one of the reasons we entitled this interaction, interactive reflection, is that being that they're reflecting back to you, portions or ideas within yourself, they are doing so for a reason, they are doing so in a particular timing by definition. Our suggestion is that you can interact with these reflections, you can allow your becoming aware of them to be the action of the reflection, but your willingness to glean from any reflection then allows you to act on what you learn from it. Because it all does exist within you, anything that exists, any of these reflections belong. There simply is no such thing as something slipping into creation. It is either there or not there, all the things that exist in that sense exist. So therefore you may understand that there are no pointless creations, there are no extraneous creations. There is however the tendency to label something as extraneous, which is then not using something that you are reflecting back to yourself in a positive way. Therefore allow us to begin by saying that there are no pointless or extraneous creations, and any reflection, any idea that you become aware of in your life, you can use inaction in a positive way. Now all situations within your life have no built in meaning. You supply the meaning, and according to the meaning that you supply, you then get an effect out. So perhaps something happens, it has no built in meaning, but you decide, perhaps because society it is a tendency in a type of case such as that, that this is bad when you do and then act with the premise that this is bad, you can only get from that neutral symbol with no built in meaning a quote unquote bad seeming effect. But it also works the other way around because they have no built in meaning and contain equal potential for positive and negative interpretation. You can always, even if you initially label something negative, always remind yourself that this is a reflection within me, that all the reflections that I create have a reason to exist. If I now begin to consciously decide to use this, I can now rather than looking at why is this happening to me, have the perspective and point of view of using the reflection by simply deciding to glean how is this of service to me. For you're approaching a reflection from the point of view that you get to choose how to label it and therefore get to choose the effect you get out of it, always gives you in any given circumstance the option to ask how does this serve me exactly the way it is. You create these reflections again to mirror back to you ideas within your conscious. And when you use interact with a reflection, you allow it to deliver its positive message in a sense you can say the true reason that you created the symbol is fulfilled. So therefore, many times individuals will create the idea of seeing repetition of negativity in their life. Now understand from our perspective, each time anything occurs it is a new event. And also do you make a connection to a path by labeling it that way. But each event is discreetly anew. If it seems to be coming around again here it comes again, it is truly a new creation. You are giving it the significance. You are giving it the connection to the old unpreferred idea. But you can use this as well. For understand that all symbols simply are a reflection of a message. And if you get the message then there will not seem to be a repetition or a re-presentation of a similar seeming symbol. Now very often individuals will begin to look at this idea. And they will say when a particular symbol comes along, well on the surface it means this, this and this to me. And this is of service to them perhaps and they learn from it. However sometimes they will perceive that it keeps coming around. Now again it is a new creation but may seem very similar to an old reflection. We understand this. Therefore you may assume the following when this occurs. Not that you have not gleaned from the symbol something positive, but that whatever you are assigning as that meaning for that symbol, if it seems to keep coming around, is not the only meaning. But a symbol seeming to repeat after you have looked at many issues tells you that you need not keep giving it the same label for you have already looked at that label. So it gives you an opportunity to assign a new meaning. And if you are creative about it and really are honest with yourself in a given moment, you will find the meaning relevant to that moment. And if you get the message that you created the symbol to give or reflect back to you, the symbol transforms and no longer seems to come. One of the keys to doing so is to remain as you say in the moment about it. For example a particular scenario comes along which you say here that comes again. Now I have looked at this symbol, I have gleaned many meanings from it but here it comes again. Her first suggestion is to remove saying here it comes again and say here is a discrete reflection occurring right now in this moment with these set of parameters that are in my life right now. Now perhaps on the surface it seems similar to something else but let us put that something else aside for it is not relevant to right now. Once you have done so you are isolating that reflection in the moment and it has come to you in the moment because that particular moment is precisely the most conducive moment for you to glean from the symbol and transform it. So simply you can say to yourself if you wish, how does this symbol serve me exactly the way it is exactly right now when it is occurring. Giving again any references to a past which is the only thing that creates the seeming continuity to the past. Is this clear? If not we will discuss it in the interaction. But again understand that you are all reflections to each other. We only in interacting with you are reflections to you of what you already know. However you can only perceive something if you first contain it otherwise it would make no sense at all. If you ask a question you already by definition contain the answer and are simply phrasing it or placing it outside of yourself for outer validation. But obviously again when someone comes along after you ask a question and gives an answer and you say oh that is right how did you know. You only knew because you already contained the answer. Therefore in interacting with you we are not truly teaching you anything you do not know. We are reflecting back to you what you feel will benefit you to interact with but in a way where you still have the removal one step of responsibility in that you are seeking that validation from us quote unquote externally. That is one way to learn. And in fact now that you recognize that everything is a reflection simply by treating it this way you are equalizing yourself with all the reflections in your life. Again most obviously if you look in the mirror anything that is reflected back to you is exactly equal to who you already are. Therefore allow us to thank you for allowing us and enabling us to reflect back to you. As we reflect to you you also reflect to us and allow us to see just how many more ways all that is what you call God expresses itself throughout the multiverse for there are an infinite number of expressions of all that is and each time in that sense we are presented with another one that is that much more of ourselves that we are aware of. For we also understand from our perspective you are but reflections of us as well. And this is one of the basic paradoxes of creation for you all create your own reality and everything within that reality is but a reflection of you but the paradox is this is also true for all other individuals and from your perspective sometimes this can seem a bit overwhelming a bit confusing but all that is is infinite and you are a finite exploration within infinity. So finite exploration translates pretty well to infinite consciousness but infinite consciousness by definition has a certain difficulty in translating into your finite consciousness. So when you find something that appears rather to be this or that and find that it is this and that you are beginning to skate on the edge of non-physical reality and that paradox is an expression of the infinite nature of creation. So therefore you are each at the same time creating your own reality but so is everyone else and from each one of your perspectives as you grow as you expand as you begin to integrate the reflections back into you so that they are no longer separations but integration it will always seem as though all of reality is merging into you. But again, paradoxically this is true for everyone else. So nothing is ever lost. Individuality at least in the overall sense is maintained and this is true for everyone. One last idea before we proceed to the interaction being that this is perhaps a conducive atmosphere to discuss this briefly. You have what you call animal consciousness upon your planet and we wish now to draw this into the main theme that we are discussing. For animal consciousness is a reflection within you although it is manifested as a consciousness reflection. So therefore you can understand animals as well to be symbols of ideas that are within you. Now there are some general overall mass agreed upon ideas of what a particular symbol will stand for but in the overall sense that can be as individual as there are individuals. So there are some common themes into how individuals will interpret these reflections but there are shall we say quite a bit of the interpretation that will simply be individual. So what a particular animal might mean to one person may simply be different from what it means to another but both are correct for both are reflecting back to themselves and only can you in reflecting back to yourself get a reflection of a portion of yourself. So the reflections of you are appropriate for you the reflections of someone else are appropriate reflections for them and it need not be that it is this or that it can be both. Because we have also shared the ultimate truth very often individuals in your society will say well what is the ultimate truth but paradoxically again the ultimate truth is composed of all truth and the mere leaving out of one of those truths then does not make it ultimately the truth. So therefore all truths are true to those who believe them all belief systems work for the individuals that exist within them. By beginning to use your reflections in a conscious way you will reflect back to yourself many things very often as you are beginning to take back your power and decide to create your life according to preference you will give yourself the opportunity in perfect timing to reflect back to yourself the limiting belief that you still hold that when you transform will allow you to begin to realize experientially that you do create your own reality what accelerates this process most greatly is your willingness to use those reflections to interact with those reflections not just simply have them be nice ideas but when you glean something from them ground yourself and allow yourself to see how you can use them how you can do something about what you have learned from any reflection once you do something apply what a reflection brings to you then it transforms and then it becomes part of you and not separate from you needing to reflect back to you. So your willingness to use all your reflections use all your creations to see what you still believe that limits you is the liberating notion for only only only can you change a belief that you hold if you first old acknowledge that you have that belief by simply denying a belief and acting according to the preferred belief the denial of the old belief holds it firmly in place and you cannot as you say escape that particular belief but by acknowledging your old unpreferred belief seeing how it has allowed you to feel think and act acknowledging that you have felt thought and acted according to that old belief realizing that it is alright that you have done that stating the new belief projecting how you would then feel think and act with the new belief and then acting like a person with a new belief having acknowledged the old belief this is the simple way to change a belief but again you will never do so by denying a belief that you hold and if you do that is not the end of the process for you will then anything that you deny you will then reflect back to yourself in some way that you are still denying that and give yourself the opportunity to look at that belief many times the reflections that bring to you your most limiting beliefs may on the surface look like events which are negative but your labeling of those events as negative in the past put them back into the closet of denying your willingness to use the reflections in a positive way now allow you to own and acknowledge what you already believe individuals in your past have feared to acknowledge what they already believe not understanding that that acknowledgement is the liberation from that idea for it is not the mere having of an belief emotion or thought that creates the reality into your life it is the actions that you take having that belief emotion and thought as a premise so you need not fear your thoughts you need not fear the reflections but simply not be willing to act until you have acknowledged an old outdated belief chosen a new belief so that your actions are then reflective of the new belief so therefore you can evaluate any idea you wish no matter how negative and never have it affect your life in that it will become an experience however the moment you act the moment you do things with that negative belief as a premise it subtly by definition affects those actions and those actions with that affectation is what gives you the negative result by using all your creations realizing there are no negative creations only negative interpretations you do not keep stuffing your beliefs back into the closet of denial you acknowledge them choose a new and transform them for the acknowledgement of the old belief equalizes it to all other ideas giving you then equal choice or access to all new ideas again the denial though it would seem to give it less weight actually gives it more places more attention upon it so therefore interact with your reflections allow them to deliver to you positive messages allow everything that you create within your life to be of service to you then act and this is interacting with your reflections interactive reflections for your willingness to interact with us in unconditional love in exchange and willingness to exchange information ideas concepts feelings the least that you have we thank you and again revel in interacting with your consciousness in this way may I simply ask you now how may I be of service to you sharing a reason I have a reason my time there with you and our consume the yellow green thing that I'm using. And I have myself one day, I started getting red, broken up, tall as my absolute question. With the props that are in place, so to speak, in your life right now, is there an area that is immediately obvious standing out as an area in which you are still squashing or squelching your communication? When I look at that, from our last impression, now we are not talking about what you have already in that sense integrated, but right now with what's in place right now, is there a particular scenario whereby you are not communicating who you are bottling up this idea? It's green, high, tall, and green. Pay attention. It will be obvious. Now also, when you perceive in your psychic adventures that certain communications are coming through, do not resist that either. For that form of resistance is also a form of squelching. It is very quiet, it's not happening to you. Yes, but understand that within that silence is the sound in that sense that you wish to hear. It is literally embedded within the silence itself, again as paradoxical as that may sound. I understand that. What can I use for myself? I know this is the example. I know this is the example. I know this is the example. Oh, one of our suggestions would be in that sense. To avail yourself of a cool, clear body of water and allow them to swim. Allow them to spend some time emerged in that particular substance. Visualizing, if you will, the cleansing and the releasing of, shall we say, bottled up ideas within yourself and allowing them to diffuse into the substance of the water itself. Purify, if you will. And that can apply to yourself as well, though perhaps for you in your bathtub. Oh, that would be a physical reflection that in that sense, if you remain quite open, you will find will deliver to you a particular message. So I should just go without it on how to do projects. Well, that is up to you. But at least you can now have some fun. Okay, because the symbol is so it's there something you can see in my own magic. Hey, interestingly enough. As you and your society understand what you call the metamorphosis of what you call caterpillar into butterfly. And the physical changes and the rotations thereof that occur in that process, perhaps to some degree on some level, you are judging that particular symbol within yourself. Perhaps placing a set of rigid expectations of a pace at which the metamorphosis must take place. And this is one of the ideas we focus your attention upon. And to you. Shitting! Yeah, he's female, then my. Hi, my name is all may share the gift that you want. There are three issues in my life now that I'm looking back. Oh, three issues, only three. The first one is typical metamorphosis. This one. Oh. It's quite common. We just had a natural path, only there was tropical and I've been treating it, but I've got a lot of information about it, which is a lot of different issues. And the treatment that I'm going to really see for our not-for-notch, and this, but it is all up. May I ask you a few questions? First of all, do you perceive that there is a physical source of this aggravation? Is there something that you do when that symbol then becomes more prevalent? I believe it's related to stress. Oh, very general. What does the symbol of the bloating mean to you? Um, inversion, protection. Ah. From what? Here. Oh, protecting yourself from your own fear. Very interesting. Now, this is not using your reflection, but denying it. For there is nothing inherently wrong with fear. And in fact, fear is an emotion, is a reflection that is most useful, but not when you deny it, and not when you attempt to get rid of it. Again, we will share that being that you are the entire universe, there is no outside. So where will you get rid of it, too? There is nowhere to put it, but you can transform it. So therefore, when you feel it in the moment that you are feeling it, use it, ask yourself some questions. All right. First of all, feel it by cutting off your feeling of it. You do not allow it to deliver its messages to you. So first of all, feel the fear. There is a notion that the feeling of fear is a negative idea, and in and of itself that is simply a judgment. Feel the fear. Dive into it. If you're going to create it, create as much fear as you possibly can. Object terror, if you can. Then while you are feeling that, ask yourself what must I believe right now to be feeling this, for emotions are always, always, always a response to a belief. Now in general, fear is the symbol that tells you that you believe that a reality that you do not prefer is most likely. In a given situation, you can question why you would believe that, and in fact perhaps ask yourself if you really still do believe that, for you may choose now not to. But again, the symbol in and of itself would reflect to you your need for protection, which is the same as saying you expect an attack. And the setting up of protection in and of itself is the same as the setting up of the attack. So next time you feel the fear, use your reflection. Interact with your reflection. Number two. Number two is the tranquility I have had for about the front. There was a lot of heart-tolerant to my heart doing this, because of the Americans. Well, this was a connection that was very near and dear to you, and you have begun to walk, shall we say, in those mock-asseers. So, we'll follow. If we're ready to interact with the communities, because when I last started to do five things by myself, we started to do five things by myself. We've got to do five things by myself. So, I'm supposed to... I'm supposed to... It's so funny. I sort of... It's ingrained which I've been worried with, and we have to act on what it says to the most, but not to be very much into this matter, and you can't just write me to the matter. And this is one of the things that we share about excitement. You have something you consider your overall most exciting thing, and many times that will simply not be available as an option in a given moment. When you choose from what is available, the thing that you are most excited about may seem on the surface to have nothing to do with the most exciting thing. But the excitement, the fact that you have that vibratory reaction to it, is what tells you it is related, again, as stepping stones in a pond, which may seem unrelated, but you cannot get to the end stone lest you first walk on the beginning stones, and that is what tells you it is related. So, there is the concept of establishing your purpose by establishing what excites you the most in your life, but there is also your moment to moment purpose, and that will always be from what is available with your integrity, choosing that which excites you, and you have created the thread from seemingly unrelated ideas. Thank you. Rosie? Well, I'm going to ask you a question that you have. Perhaps what have you found? Well, I'm going to ask you a question. Where exactly is it you are going? Oh.. Do, by the way, continue to speak up so that all may share. How are you enjoying them? Yes. Congratulations. There's a lot of people. First, you don't have to. You don't have to. Well, to some degree you identify with a symbol from in a sense having lived through your version of it, but you may find much of that particular issue to be somewhat surface oriented to get you there. And once you are physically there, much of what you are asking will simply unfold. There are deeper connections that you will establish, what you would consider to be spiritual connections with a particular perspective that you will attract to yourself again when you physically visit. And I mean in that sense, 2017, yes, for I would not unwrap that present 40th. And now I can hear your stand. I'm way not necessary and you may be creating a connection where none need be established but should you decide to create it then it will seem like that was the only way. Well have you created a memory? Some degree. Oh then simply understand that that memory that you have created is the history perhaps you can say of the unprepared you. So now go back in your imagination recreate perhaps similar set of circumstances except do what it is you wish you had done when you recreate it so that you can now also on the menu of the past of the many use create a you a past you that corresponds to the new preferred present you does that make sense. Therefore if you are going to in a sense play that game play it from both ends give yourself two histories to choose from. Or where in a particular situation where you sense you may be in your interpretation violated split up for your rights or perhaps if you feel that it had occurred then was able to express what you felt you were not able to express them. If in this exploration you are excited to do so yes otherwise it will not be necessary but you will simply know but one thing at a time first recreate the preferred past. For when you say you remember a past it is truly not that past it is a recreation through the you that you are right now through the belief that you have right now and not generally very accurate of what actually occurred. Or it is a tendency in your society in what you label the relationship of what you call cause and effect to believe that each present moment is the result of a past moment and it is not now this is not to say that past moments a b and c do not lead to the but b is not at all affected by a b and c once you are at the until you say it is and you are creating the connection is the only thing that gives you the effect of the whole of the past on you right now but another perspective just as valid is that the present is not a result of the past it contains everything you need right here and right now and anything that you perceive to have been a past event you can simply use as a lesson in the present. Is this absurd? Yes. Oh and we thank you as well. Male. What are you doing tonight? Perfect. Adar you all. A perfect reflection of whatever you are exploring at any given moment. I have a number of questions tonight I thought out very carefully. Oh do you speak up? So that all may enjoy them. My first question is what was the red craft I saw Thursday night at around 11.40 p.m. driving over to Connecticut this object appeared to my left going in a north by northwest direction slightly wobbling but moving very fast and just disappeared. Can you tell us something else about it? Well it was it wasn't like it looked like it was a round craft it was sort of box shaped. Oh were there like what are like it was just all red. What was the time of day there was a night and it was at 11.40 p.m. One moment. For a particular understanding was that it was a misidentification of an earth craft. Okay. I'll leave that one alone then. My second question also two thirties ago my friend Tom and I after our intergalactic information was staged and that signed off. We went outside to look at the exceptionally clear night sky when I suddenly noticed an object of pure light that was different from the rest of the stars in the sky about 12.30 to 12.30 a.m. to 1 a.m. in that area in the morning it was moving in circles and a big guy back and forth and a smore which to the human eye seemed to be out of our earth's atmosphere. Can you expand on this for us who these things were and were they aware of our radio operations. Oh. In a sense you may understand that that would represent extraterrestrial craft the origin of which would be from our perspective. Pleiadian in nature and it is not so much that they listen in on the broadcast. No. Okay. Well you were going to say something more than that. Okay. Now what's the reason then for them being at that time or is it just going to. Well now now now. We have had many discussions with you. As we'll always always share that everything is as significant as you choose to assign it from our perspective it obviously had a significance to you now be bold and tell me that's significant I will. I had been thinking about tonight during that evening and I had. By the way is a Pleiadian female. Yes. And I was with myself falling out to Niai's name. Very lonely, very loudly within myself. And then when we went out after the thing was over I looked up and I saw what perceived to me to be like a craft in my vision street. Then you may understand that the significance was that that was a response. Is that Niai's craft? For the purposes of the question yes. How many people were employed here. It is our perception that at the time of deciding there were approximately five individuals present. What would perhaps be called a scout craft or beam ship if you will. A small of craft. Well that is very easy to just internal saying just whatever I said to have that happen. I'll be saying to Niai and me. Well it is not that it will always be necessary for there to be a blatant symbol. For understand you need not seek your validation as to whether or not this is occurring from external sources. What you may understand is that you are beginning to validate what you are perceiving internally and that is the only way you can then have an external reflection. It is not that they will present their craft to prove anything to you. No. It is that your reflection of simply already believing and accepting it and validating it will then be reflected back to you externally but only when you first internally validate. So that is a strong symbol but will not always be necessary and should you feel that you are requesting it out of a need for validation you will not see it. Right. I understand that 100%. Now we simply also suggest continuing in when you feel this way interacting internally for you are as we have said a conduit and can allow direct communication to whatever degree you are willing to begin to validate what comes through and we have been sharing this with you since the very first time we physically interacted with you in this way. And I actually have used that ability to go within interact with Tania. Obviously if I was invalidated with myself the fact that they were in their scholarship at that moment would not have not occurred. Well also understand that you need not necessarily ask me not that we don't enjoy interacting with you obviously we do. But you can ask her and that is the point your willingness to begin to rely on the agreement that you have made will strengthen the definition of that agreement and any information that you may require as to where and when you would need be to have a particular interaction occur physically will come to you directly. Do you have that much trust? Yes I do. I have complete trust actually. I have two more questions over now. Can the association of worlds along the scribe in depth the post-Hondel that the Earth is now entering and our solar system as a whole what affects world is having life on this world human animal mammal all life forms that exist in the now moment of Earth's transformation. Our particular perspective is that there will be no deleterious effects and that this is simply a symbol of the intersection shall we say of more than one reality and an outward external reflection of your individual willingness to begin to open up to new energies open up to the possibility of new reality. There need not be the negative expectation of this. My last question is a line as life beings from various civilizations from many solar systems now incarnated on Earth as a joyful choice on assignment and as equal partners in this transformation using creative ways to bring more light to all living beings on this wonderful planet. My question to the association of worlds is we all have an integral.
