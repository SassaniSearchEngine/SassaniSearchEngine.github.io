 All right, I'll say greetings to you this evening of your time as you create time to exist. I will not ask you how you are, for I know you are all perfect reflections of whatever it is you are exploring at any given moment. Allow me to proceed in the following way. Most recently we have been, perhaps you can say in the process of simplification or simplify many of the things that we have discussed with you about your lives, about our lives, about our co-created interactions, and about many of the things that we share with you. And your civilization. I remind you that anything that we do share, you already contain, and therefore any inspiration that you derive from either our source, our stream of consciousness, or from any source that you perceive to be external to yourself in your own reality, that you already contain all the knowledge, already contain all the resources. And simply these particular timings whereby you become aware of information that seems to inspire you, seems to set off a spark within you, is simply the timing of your willingness to express more of who you already are. And therefore you can either, as you say, lament in your timing or you can revel in your timing and understand that it is far more purposeful than perhaps you have been taught in your civilization. Therefore when you become aware of something, it is simply the external reflection from yourself to yourself of something which you already knew, but are now ready to express in your reality. Therefore as always we take no credit for anything that you feel that you may gain from these interactions in that we are simply a mirror and you are the originating source of light and therefore although we enjoy these interactions and get as much out of them from our end as you do, remind you that it is all you. We have discussed and again simplified many of the concepts that we talk about with members of your society down to the idea of deciding in each and every moment who you are trusting that decision and then acting as though you trust that decision. This is the mechanism through which you already create your own reality and therefore nothing new, nothing to learn, no muscles to develop. You already contain this and do it. It is simply a matter of shifting your purposefulness, shifting your approach, shifting your focus and beginning to factor in the idea of desire and preference for you deserve to live the life that you desire and at the same time can be a productive feature in your reality. We also have discussed that always do you create entirely right now, right now is the only experiential moment that exists and although you will play the game of a seeming succession of now's one after the other, it is all truly most accurately speaking the same one now moment which you roll out in front of yourself to experience it in a linear way because it is always right now you always have all your power at your disposal right now. Decision, trust and action right now. Understanding this and sensing as you say the collective energy of the group presence this evening of your time, I have made the following decision. I trust this decision. I will act upon this decision right now and that is that we will begin this interaction with sharing. Sharing. Ice. And to you. Good day. I was short and sweet. Oh well why? If you say so. It caught us all off guard I believe. Oh what? Always a pleasure. I have made a decision about a week ago or more. How to do it Christmas and I purchased an item, a cloak if you will for my friend and I did it over the phone to a person far away I never even saw the cloak I just purchased it over the phone. All right. Remote control cloak. Do proceed. Now this cloak had not arrived and I've become quite concerned. Ah not trusting your cloak. Proceed. Right. So driving here I was looking to trusting your decision and I did. I went through the so-called process if you want to call it that. And I did make the decision and I said what's wrong with the situation because maybe it's one more test that I have created for myself to see if I really do feel that I deserve. Well it's all well and good and by all means test yourself if you feel the need but you need not in that sense continually lay out your reality in such a way where you are not committed in your decision and feel the need to test it in order to establish your commitment. Simply perhaps utilizing the physical features of this particular circumstance perhaps a phone call would be in order. I'm checking on my cloak. That would be the action that trusts the decision of buying the cloak in the first place and then having it occur to you I am wondering whether or not I did the right thing. All right. I've made the calls and I knew that when I purchased it the lady said she works out of her home she's a craft person that's not a store or a business and she had physically moved to Florida. So today I took the action of calling Florida trying to find her and I still haven't found her. I tried doing that. Oh. And you are trying since we find her. Well that's it. I've taken that action. Now I think it's my fear that I'm creating some fear that it's not going to arrive in time and that I'm wondering where it is and I think I may be ripped off and all these terrible negative things. It is not my perception that that is the case but you can play around with what comes up for you with that supposition and look at what you are truly deciding. Should you choose to continue to test yourself in such a way? I've decided that I deserve this great gift. I need this. So what? What do you ask you a question? What is it that you wish to cloak? My girlfriend. Oh, perhaps there is another issue here. Simply toying with the language. Okay. So you think that perhaps if I look at that issue if there is one, that will help manifest? Actually no. I was kidding. Okay. But in a short sweet way I want to move this along and I want to transform it right now. How? You just have. Now do you trust that? I trust that. Do you understand that you do not need to test yourself? For that is if you wish to nail it down as you say the issue. Feeling the idea that your decision does not completely stick and that your decision must be tested in order to again commit to the continued establishment of that decision. I deserve, I do not deserve is a decision. It is not a judgment placed against you from an external source. Perhaps again I can turn this around and simply ask you do you deserve? Yes. All right. You have decided that you do. It is no longer an issue. Trust as though that decision has stuck because it has unless you change it. In which case it really did stick now and only when you change it does the new decision stick. And again another way to word the idea of trusting the decision is to simply take for granted with absolutely no movement that it has stuck that the decision is registered. Okay. Do you feel in your interactions with others that your integrity is fully present? Were someone to for instance order a product from you? Would you send that product out on the agreed upon timeframe? Absolutely. Oh, interesting. Yes. But that's it. Well thank you. You deserve nothing less. That's not the issue that I will think. Oh. I kind of sense the woman wasn't quite coming from integrity when I spoke to her. In what way? Well my sensing when I first spoke to her on the phone was a little bit of chaos and kind of a person who has a lot going on in their lives. Oh, now is that out of integrity or is that simply confusion and lack of organization? Yes, that's all right. Okay. Now what will you do? I've made the decision. It's coming. Now each day I hope future but each day that it does not arrive in the mail I will align myself to this. When is it that you will not future or you are doing so right? I can say. That's a great way just to tell you what I'm going to do. I'm just going to do it. Can I get away with that around here? On what? Of course I say you can. That's it. I've made the decision. That's all I can do and that's what I was asking you about. Oh. I guess. I'm the employee of the wrapping as well as the gift. I will. I can't wait till it comes. Oh, but I will. If you say so. Apparently you will wait till it comes. But I understand what you mean. I understand what you mean. Do you have plucking devices by the way? No. We are not in that sense hiding from anything. And our relationship with physical reality is quite different from yours. Our ability to simply relocate instantaneously and spontaneously in that sense no longer necessitates the idea of needing to become quote unquote invisible. I suppose where I could get completely accurate it is an ability that we can in that sense express invisibility. And we have no reason to do some perhaps unless we're playing around. May I ask you one more brief question? By the way, interesting idea. I think I'll do that later. Oh. Funny. Perhaps it will take the form of something like boo. Okay. I went over my head. Not brief. Okay. Can I ask you another question? You just did. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm not getting on. I'm doing a lot. I'm doing a lot. I'm doing a while about a week or so much two weeks ago. I engaged with some sort of energy and she meaning a female identified herself as Star Fire. How exciting? It was. Very much. And she said, I am Star Fire. But I think it had something to do with what I was engaging in that day and that night. But you have anything to say about her because my idea that she is a physical being who in human life in shape who lives many, many, many galaxies away from us. And that it was giving me for some reason. And what exactly would you need me to add to that? I believe that I know it. I'm wondering. And thank you for boldly sharing that with me. I believe you. I do too. And in my soul's journey, I'm wondering, you're part of my soul's journey. How can you add more to this about who Star Fire is? Simply as you have said, a relationship on one level that you are establishing, but that on another level has already been established for many years. And she is now re-communicated with me just to say hello. Nothing distracts you from your reality, but as you have said simply to say, greetings. Why now? Perhaps Christmas. And now I am not kidding. If you explore what I am saying, it will become apparent. Well, Earth energy is becoming very loud to me, not in a true way, but Earth energy is really blossoming. And the idea of Christmas is rebirth and rebirth in everybody that cries with them. And Star Fire for one is an example of somebody who is far away but has a connection with our inner Earth being. And who can relate to the willingness to express that energy from within you? Yes. So in our Earth, there is an energy of people perhaps worth a fifth density. Do you agree with that? All reality exists simultaneously. So literally speaking, yes. And the way that perhaps the question is phrased and with the meaning or the idea behind how you are asking it, perhaps not as blatantly. It overlaps, but it isn't physically corresponding in such a way where it would be a distraction to you. I'd like to stop talking right now. By all means. I just made that decision. Thank you for your willingness to express yourself. Shitting. It's been a long time since I haven't spoken to you. If you say so. To me, just like yesterday. I'll wait. And the question about human. Oh, wait. Prose. So do others. I believe that everything is possible. I believe that in practicality, most things are possible. I believe that there are spontaneous healings, but in my experience, I've found that where people have had spontaneous healing, your greatest system. And many, I will say most, and I won't even say many, but in some cases, they re-manifest the problem to an even more serious degree. And I'm wondering if there is any rule of belief system, energy that creates that effect. The idea is that what you generally refer to as this is. It's issues that individuals have been unwilling to acknowledge within themselves to the point where they become overwhelmingly clamorous and then demand an individual's attention. In general, there are core ideas and then subsidiary ideas around them. Individuals can sometimes be addressing only the subsidiary ideas. And if the core idea is not acknowledged and a decision is not made regarding the revelation that comes from in that way, exploring the core issue, the main idea, then you can have the effect you have described. If you look at the core issue, what is this situation forcing me to look at that I would not have looked at without it? And then look at that and then make new decisions understanding that those core issues simply were decisions in and of themselves, then the quote unquote spontaneous healing, which is simply the re-establishment of equilibrium physically will be, as you say, more permanent. It goes back to the idea of foundational understanding versus putting on a right, a band-aid. One person in particular for actually giving me some information on him, his name is George, Max Cancer Flat in a short period of time. It has been, he went about a year or more without any indication Dr. Toldham's issue had been dead twice, but he was doing perfectly straight. Then he developed cancer in many areas simultaneously. I would be curious if I'm allowed that information to know what message he needs. The allowance would come from him and in that sense perhaps him asking the question would allow me to have access to specific information that is not apparent to me now. But again in a general way, the idea is that there are certain issues that he did look at and other issues surrounding them more core that he did not address. He can address them at any given moment. He can reestablish his new decision and he can't have the same complete spontaneous healing effect once again. Just one thing to go home to be an adequate reason to manifest something like that? Going home meaning what? Expiring, dying, whatever semantically you use. Understand that my particular perspective is that you are home itself and there is nowhere to go to that is any more you than where you are right now. So in the way that you phrase the question my particular response would be no. It is more of an escape perhaps than the idea of going to more of his own. Do you understand where that element is present? That is by the way one of the very common core issues. What you would call the notion, the idea that somehow death would liberate one from themselves which is somewhat of a paradox from my point of view. Because anywhere you are is you. Anywhere you have been is you. Anywhere you are going is you. So ultimately one place to the other for the purposes of going toward yourself is simply constantly being yourself the entire time and perhaps simply not acknowledging. Does that make sense? Yes. Oh. Now can you tell me understanding that individual what your intuitive perception is of the core issue as it is evident to you? I don't know. Well it would have to be intuitive. I think he still has a feeling of the best way of his syndrome that even though he got his healing, the miraculous healing, I'm not sure we can believe it. Oh. Well do you understand, fluctuating belief is simply fluctuating decision. And the idea of having a belief carries the assumption that either you have it or you don't. And if you have it and it's not constructive, you have to get rid of it and get a new belief that is constructed. That particular interpretation and then the decisions that correspond from that interpretation are rather limiting. And in that sense constantly have individuals running from one idea going to a better idea needing to get something that they don't already have. And what we remind you of when speaking to you is you always contain every belief and it's reciprocal. And it's simply a matter of which one are you expressing, not which one do you have and you don't have the other. So he has the belief that he is a complete and whole being who deserves to serendipitously and joyously live his life as well as any other belief that he has. When he is willing to decide this is who I am from choice, this is who I am from decision and desire and then trust that that decision has stuck, everything immediately shifts to accommodate that decision. Let me approach this from a different direction. If one does not address the core belief that is creating or bringing about the distance, what other mechanisms can be utilized if any to de-create the disease? Either ways around it. In the sense, in the sense, none. Again addressing subsidiary beliefs can seem to gloss over the situation temporarily. But again these beliefs are not something bestowed upon you that you are stuck with, that are locked in your subconscious and very difficult to get at, and once you get at it all you find out is what a miserable person you are. That is simply one interpretation of what core beliefs mean. Again you contain in your core every belief and it's reciprocal. Simply understanding that you are functioning, that you are deciding, that you are interpreting your reality through a specific belief gives you back the decision making power to choose something else. So it's common to all healings that the person you would address a core belief to be successful. On a fundamental level, yes, it can take many different faces or forms in the way that individuals do that. For instance, in acknowledging your totality, in deciding to be the fullest you you can be, that decision can replace a decision from a disempowered belief that you have been expressing and spontaneously healing can occur without any of the emphasis upon the idea of sickness and wellness. And without examining that belief specifically also would you just be more of an empowerment? In a sense, by choosing its reciprocal you do examine the idea of the existence of the belief. But you do not empower the belief, you do not act as though that belief has a hold or a power that is apart from you and your power. When someone chooses a symbol whether it's a church, a medicine, a healer or a cheerio, if they believe that will do it for them and they attach themselves to that symbol saying now it's done, then they also empower themselves there. Although I have not heard before the reference to cheerios, I would agree. Is this a healing substance upon your planet? It's a breakfast. It's a breakfast. It's a breakfast. I think that clarifies the bell. Oh, if not by all means, share again. Shutting. It's too many. I've been to a channel in recently where the information was given that December 31st signals the end of the free will design on earth. Could you comment on your understanding of that situation? Absolutely. That is not my perspective. What is the approach, the point of view, the rationale for such a statement? Do you know? The rationale. And what does it actually mean? It means that from what I understand that at that point rather than being given the choice between love and fear, will be given the choice between truth and illusion. And if there may be a, let's say, those that choose to live in truth will have an ability to more fully co-create without limitations. All right, allow me to ask you a question. And I don't know if I quoted that correctly. Understood. But given the idea of what you are saying, exactly who is it that has decided this date? It was channeled from a group of amorphous beings. Oh. Do these amorphous beings have authority on your own decision-making process and sovereignty of creating your own reality? Now, the answer is yes and no, both. Your decision, this looks evident to me, makes your effect yes. Your decision, that is an opportunity to see an example of who I absolutely am not, gives you the no effect. So either way you decide, and either way it has been of service to you to allow you to define yourself still further. Only you can decide. Whatever your criteria is for rendering a decision, is almost irrelevant it is the decision itself that's fixed. So therefore, outside authority has decided this particular date is the end of the road for free will. And you decide, sounds reasonable to me, you can actually get the effect of living on such a world. Therefore from that perspective, they were right. But from the perspective of understanding, that is very interesting. And I can understand where some people would have a tendency to believe that. And I validate that as a viewpoint. It certainly is not representative of what I am learning about myself, understanding about myself, and choosing to express about myself. And this goes for anything. Something you read, something you hear on your radio. See on your television. A conversation that you have with some great being. Simply only with your agreement, which is decision, do you create any effect in your life including that one. Now it would seem to me, particularly given the very slim time frame, that that perhaps would not be quite an advantageous point of view to buy into to continue to expand your awareness. But it is up to you and I do not invalidate it as an option. As far as some overall tendency, some mass agreed upon idea. My view, my understanding is that that is not so. And that there will not be a date. There will be thresholds. But even those may only be relevant to certain individuals. There are no mass thresholds which are felt by all per se. There can be this idea. But per se, in general it will not apply across the board. So individual may come up to another individual. I am completely transformed. Second individual may ask why? First individual may say because yesterday was 1111. Second individual may reply, strange. Seems just like the next day to me. And both are correct. And individual number two has now become aware of a threshold. At least another individual's version of such a threshold. When you begin to expand as a society into a more cohesive society, there may be certain agreements, there may be certain understandings that will play out in certain timing. Not unlike what you refer to as your holidays which are simply mass agreed upon timeframes to express certain ideas which are by the way expressed very, veryably and not consistently at all between individuals. These types of thresholds may be agreed upon as you begin to function more in tandem. Is that all? Yes. Are you sure? I have it yet. Form another question but I'm sure I have it. All right. All right. Male. Other male. Greeting. Greeting. Proceed. I have a dialema or at least what appears to be a contradiction. All right. Let's take the idea of the course that we create our own reality 100%. And then compare that with that in a relationship with another person, we are co-creating and therefore I say well gee, no longer am I 100% in control of that relationship. Well interestingly enough this is how most of you interpret and decide your relationship function and simply it is perhaps a word play going on here. You are always 100% responsible for your version, your interpretation and your output into a relationship. The other individual also has that same responsibility and ability. The co-creation though it may appear to be a single entity is truly still to interpretation. In other words, we speak of co-creating this interaction with you. And so there is the idea that this interaction is one thing and then there is you beholding it and me beholding it and all the other individuals. But truly that is not accurate. The actual idea is what we are calling an interaction is as many versions of what is going on as there are individuals present including myself. The co-creation is rather arbitrary for you will have as many descriptions of what the co-creation actually was as there are individuals. So it all boils back down to you being responsible for your decisions, your reality. By all means being able to share 100% of who you are with another individual enjoying 100% of who you think, who you interpret, who you decide that they are. But you do not need to go the next step of using the idea that the co-creation is an independent entity as an excuse to not take full responsibility for your input and your particular shall I say role in the co-creation. I understand that there is confusing language here. Does this clear this up at all? Yeah, I think that is very helpful. The fact that a relationship is really not one item. There are two sides of that coin because there are two people involved. There is 100% 100% which is distinct from each giving up half of who you are. Part of the challenge of American beauty to have both people reasonably close to seeing the same and their desires of that relationship and that both sides of the coin are pretty close together. Perhaps of the relationship, a common template or overall idea would be most conducive. Yes, but in terms of needing to be the same person with the exact same interest, that is not necessarily so. So, take the idea of eventually maybe the ultimate goal of every one of us is to become quote one with God. Well, if you say so, that free supposes that you are not already and have somewhere to get that you are not already, have someone to be that you are not already and that is the decision that is a commitment to the idea of separation. A decision in separation, a trust that you are separated and then acting as though you must get somewhere and of course when you actually get there you realize you were there all along because it is all you. But if I have got free will then by definition I am not one with God or anybody. I am an individual, I am unique. Why do you assume that individuality and uniqueness is not an expression of what you call God? It is. An equality that you can possess, all that is also has perhaps you can say a version of but you are the same energy fundamentally experiencing yourself as if you are not but only during the time where you perpetuate the decision that you are not. We talked that each one of us is sort of an aspect of all that is, all that is exploring how it can recreate or know itself through each one of us. Well in a sense that is arbitrary language, all that is already knows itself completely and rather than interpreting your life and having the purpose of allowing all that is which already knows itself just by to know itself better which is impossible. It is an infinite all knowing all seeing being so to speak. You may understand that your choice to explore from your point of view is simply your choice to explore from your point of view because it is an option. Exploring all options is one way to state the purpose of physical life. Linear time as we have created it we can only explore one path at a time. Well that is part of the unique advantage that you build into the appearances of physical life yes. But perhaps it would behoove you to understand that you get to revel in the joy of focusing on one thing at a time rather than well this means you have to only do one thing at a time. If you bring the concepts of eternity again and I know that in third density I am rather limited as far as grasping all those concepts of eternity. You can actually grasp them to the level that you can use them to continue your linear life with perhaps you can say an infinite foundation. You have the ability to interpret the idea of infinity to the degree that it is useful to you. Meanwhile I am enjoying the moment. Oh thank you very much. Oh thank you. Is that all? Yes. Lael. You have to be loud. Proceed. Me. Okay. Okay. The energies that Martha talked about earlier are they call themselves the ones with no names. I know Martha and I others have had several readings with them. They have been great help to me and would never ever presuppose to tell me what to do or act in authority over me at all. I was wondering if specifically if there can be a confusion of language or if specifically when Martha says that they say that the free will experiment is over and I don't completely understand this but when they say that I was wondering if you tune in then to the source. If you're turning into them and their intention and what they mean or perhaps the language itself may trigger a response that in you that does not necessarily conform to what they intend. To a degree it is both. In general I will interact with your words. From time to time I will tap in where it is necessary for an understanding to take place to what you are referring to as the source. What may be valuable for you to look at here is the following idea. Perhaps you can call it a light under the title of not throwing the baby out with the bath water and this is that any source that is meaningful to you by all means including us. Whatever you get out of that point of view by all means take it and use it. Whatever does not resonate with your understanding idea or choice or decision of who you are, don't use it and you need not throw out what has been useful to you along with the idea of something that you feel is no longer representative of who you are. In other words be willing to drink what is relevant to you from any source and if that source also has information which is irrelevant to you you need not invalidate it and can continue to derive inspiration from that source and not need to take everything at face value. This allows you to express your own individuality, your own individual sense of discernment and your own individual ability to choose. Again it is my perspective that what you call the free will experiment would not be interpreted by my stream of consciousness per se as an experiment to begin with. So yes there are differences in the languaging and way of looking at it but to answer the question I generally did interact with the languaging that she used. Thank you. Is this in that sense assisting you or more confused? Oh no it is assisting me. I wonder if you could tap into the ones to that source and give me your impression. By all means do go on. That was my question. It is really not necessary. It is not necessary really. If something else in this regard comes up by all means do speak up again. Oh my. May I? I was wondering if you might talk about, there are so many books written these days on the ascension topic of the ascension. I was wondering if you might talk a little bit on how you in particular see this event as it is occurring as these books are stating that there is about to be a mass ascension. The idea that you generally refer to as ascension generally carries the connotation that as physical beings you are about to transform your physicality into non-physical beings together as a society in tandem if you will. And although there is this idea, this threshold, societally within what you call a mass consciousness, the way that it is generally portrayed now makes it attractive to individuals who use it as a tool to escape this reality. Having made the decision that this reality, a white is not pleasant and somewhere that they have been placed is an expression of a type of jail or hell and so the attraction to the idea of physical transcendence into perhaps you can say a light being generally has the foundational, shall I say, nuance of escaping from this hell. What is not generally discussed is that there is an intermediate phase between physical expression, limited, separated, contracted physical expression and ascension as a being who now no longer wishes to express itself through what you call physical bodies. We use the arbitrary designation that third density and this is simply a label, a description, not a law, would represent contracted separated physical experience that what you call fifth density would represent the first degree of non-physical expression in a linear sense from physical expression. What we point out and what we discuss is that there is something in between obviously in your numbers between three and five comes for fourth density is an awakened physical expression whereby you no longer build in the definition of separation from each other, separation from the reality, separation from what you call God, all that is and you experience physical reality in physical body, in purposeful, desirous, serendipitous, effortless terms. Now when I put it this way perhaps you can understand it is a step you would not want to miss, ascending straight to non-physical in a sense you would miss that particular midpoint which is again a tendency in the way that physical beings expand their consciousness seemingly in degree. Now you can circumvent this altogether, you can immediately ascend and expand right now if you close your eyes to do so and open them and are still here as a physical being you can just assume that somewhere in your being which you can get in touch with and need not keep at a distance you have decided to allow that transition to be more perhaps you can say natural. But ascension in its purest terms is simply being more of who you already are not denying who you are not running from who you are or the reality that you have created. So therefore there are these levels of distinction you are always ascending because you are always expanding into more of who you are ascending is not becoming someone you are not it is being more of who you already foundationally and fundamentally are. So generally speaking ascension in your terminology has certain connotations which denote escaping from an unpleasant circumstance. The tendency again is to smoothly transition through what we refer to as force density which is again less limited physical experience and if you understand that natural progression ascension in the way that it is portrayed is not actually timely right now. Now does this make sense? You are saying that the process we are not really going through that process at this particular time. There will always be individuals and pockets of individuals who may choose in that way to spontaneously create the idea of non-physicality. In general if they accomplish that they are doing so simply for the understanding that it is their timing to simply express themselves differently without again the connotation of running from this reality. But in mass as a planet as a mass consciousness it is not my perception that there will be an exodus ascension to non-physicality within the next many decades of your time. It simply is not timely and in that sense negates where you actually are which is at the threshold of a more limitless physical expression which again understanding what many of you tell us about your desires you would not want to miss. And when you are there sometimes and I mean this facetiously you need to drag yourself kicking and screaming to non-physicality because limitless physicality is so much fun. And also the following any ascension into more of yourself any ascension from one seeming level to the next always brings along with it an interesting realization and that is that the level that you just have previously believed yourself to exist within exists within you. Is there anything else? How about the 144,000? I believe you just said that it will be several decades at least before we have as a mass consciousness would reach that threshold where we would get. It can be longer than that by the way it simply depends how individuals enjoy so to speak fourth density. Generally speaking fourth density can last what you call hundreds of years thousand years or so it will depend again on the particular idea. Is the would you think that a hundred and forty some people said when 144,000 people on the earth get to this point to make good affect the entire planet and cause a raise in consciousness? Only to the degree that everyone else was willing to create their own version of it from the perspective of that number of people it would seem to them that everyone else followed along but not necessarily from the perspective of everyone else. It is all a matter of timing, expression, agreement. I give myself five minutes for real quick. Okay, now see you have four minutes left. See when this starts to occur. Well people say have a at the onset of it. Well they have like all of a sudden they'll spend like a minute over in the fifth dimension and they'll say oh that's going to be a little bit gradually move over more and more interesting question and I was actually about to say when individuals express themselves in fourth density though they are still physical their investment in the idea of physical being the only way there is is perhaps you can say much lighter therefore already by expressing yourself physically in a less limited way you begin to glimpse the idea you begin to familiarize yourself with the idea with the notion of the idea of non-physical consciousness and yet although there may be a math threshold individuals will pop in and out but when they do so it will be out of choice it will be out of simply shifting their perspective again rather than running from any particular undesirable set of circumstances. I guess what I'm saying what I'm talking about is in this book I get the name of it it's a new book just came out. Lady said that how people will ascend will be on a gradual process rather than in the click of a finger and then they'll sort of gradually get used to the fifth dimension by going there a little bit of a time so they don't shock their system. Well in a sense understand that the readiness is so complete that such a shock is only an interpretation from the third density. To answer your question directly individuals have the choice they can stick their toe in pull it out or dive right in. Thank you. Oh I have done nothing. I thank you. Shitting. Hey. We have been talking about ascension I wanted to ask you about what Jesus Christ did. I understand after the crucifixion and actually he didn't die but he suspended the motion using yogic techniques and after that he traveled back to India. He had lived there before but he went back to India and lived there a long life. He was an ascended being by that time and my understanding is he went back and forth to wherever he was needed. Can you tie that to the discussion we were just having? Well simply that is only one version of what you call the life of Christ. There is the assumption that there is one historical event and just as there are an infinite number of probable futures there are also an infinite number of probable paths. In one of those infinite number of probable path the scenario that you have shared in that way has occurred. In what you call perhaps the more mass agreed upon probable path the individual did die upon the cross and then did quote unquote symbolize the idea of the eternal nature of the soul by making it evident that though the body had died the soul lived on. That is the most literal interpretation from my perspective. In terms of the history that you are sharing whereby that individual would act as an ascended master perhaps it would be in that sense an example of an assisted being who resided perhaps you can say mainly in the non-physical and became physical for specific purposes. Now not to be confusing but again when you assume one path then our discussion cannot take on the multifaceted meaning that reality actually expresses. Does this answer the question? So the book the well-known book Jesus lived in India that is the name of the title of the book according to the author and he has done a lot of research. These are two of Jesus in India in Kashmir India and a lot of evidence that he was there he lived there. So according to your understanding that someone else or that is not true. Now again my perspective in the most accurate way to state this in one infinite probable path that is the case. But again you are asking the question assuming there is the past only and from the idea of the path only I cannot accurately answer your question other than to say that is not the mass agreed upon the past however from the perspective of individuals who manifest that as their path it is accurate. Is this translated? So what happens to on the evidence it means. As you know quite well evidence is very arbitrary. What one person uses for evidence for something another individual can completely use as evidence against the very same thing and it is simply a matter of the fact that believing is seeing and not the other way around. When you establish and essentially this means decide I believe this you then draw all the evidence to prove to you that that is so so does everyone else. Is arbitrage. I understand perhaps to some what I am saying is unsettling. What do you mean there is no path. My whole foundation is set up on a path. What am I going to do? I am falling apart. But the idea is there is a liberation in the now moment from understanding that the path is variable. As you shift who you are right now the past that completely supports that decision becomes your path and therefore the past is no longer a ball and chain it is simply the icing on the cake. I would like to make a comment statement that I see a lot of interaction on prodigy for instance the networking service. A lot of people are realizing that the Bible was not accurate and was changed a lot and added the information was. Before you proceed to use this as an example many people as you have said do entertain the idea you are sharing and they find whatever evidence they look for to prove it has been altered. There are perhaps you can say just as many are more accurately from my perception more individuals who take it unintended as gospel and therefore we will find the evidence as to why it is precisely literally true. The paradox is that both are correct and arguing one choice versus another choice truly cannot yield any results. It is simply a matter of being willing to make the choice of who you are who your path is and if you are willing to validate the path of the other as being accurate and relevant for them you still get the supportive feature from the chosen path that you have for you will acknowledge no matter what happened were there even a singular event no matter what happened each and every one of you function from your interpretation of what you think happened you act as though that happened and how you live right now is absolutely an example that that did happen for you in your history and so you get the effect of it having happened whether or not it even happened. Now again where this gets more complex and I do not wish to add to the complexity is that there is also no one singular event but this again is getting on to the edges of infinity and for now I will refrain is there something else yes I would like to ask something if you can comment on how we are going to I use the word drop the karma then and how are we ever going to come to the point where we are going to say enough that's it whatever I owe you whatever you owe me that's it the balance is zero and when and how are we going to do that simply by deciding simply by understanding that you are perpetuating that notion that what you call karma is an interpretation of what karma means and an imposition upon yourself of that interpretation if you interpret your reality as being the product of karmic debt then you will in that sense position your reality to pay back the debt if you simply understand that balance is instantaneous and that right now you are completely in equilibrium then you have done what you are asking instantaneously so you can instantaneously decide that and proceed debt free or you can linger on and pay back your debt or any gradient in between I understand what you're saying my question is how is everyone going to understand well how is the way to be quite succinct it is none of your business what anyone else decides that it is my business very clever then perhaps your job may feel like it is never done for what you are deciding is to take responsibility for the decisions of others now if you are willing to take responsibility for your own decision being a living example of your own decision you will attract whatever others are inspired by that decision and in that sense have the effect that you are sharing but never can you in that sense affect individuals who make different choices other than them looking at you and saying that's nonsense so perhaps if that is your decision you are taking on a monumental task and think again of the balance necessary for that if you live in equilibrium understanding that there is no karmic excuse for who you are right now that you simply are who you are right now others will notice and those will be the individual who will benefit most because of his their timing to reflect back to themselves what they are already willing to entertain and what you are a physical blatant living example of that is the mechanism does that make sense be an example less producing well if you wish to impact others but convincing others making them see doing it for them all these are fancy words for taking responsibility for them you can only be responsible to them and for yourself talking about taking the responsibility by just spreading the word that's just talking about the idea because a lot of people have never thought about it all those and by all means your attraction to the subject allows you to be a proponent of the subject when you are living the example of the realizations that you have had individuals willing to do so will benefit by seeing you as an example more than hearing you say something that your life is not an example of so by all means be at equilibrium right now that is a decision I am at equilibrium then yes there will still be balanced whatever vibration you are being in any given moment will be the reality that you experience but it will not be the result of something that you have to pay back that is not relevant to your now moment experience thank you oh I have done nothing at this timing we will pause for a short break and continue contact at that time
