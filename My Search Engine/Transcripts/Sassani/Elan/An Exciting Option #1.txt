 All right, I'll say I bid you greetings this evening of your time as you create time to exist. I will not ask how you are, for I know you are all perfect reflections of whatever it is you are deciding to be in each and every given moment. And so therefore you can never be anything but who you are and many of our discussions are focused or aimed in the direction of consciously presenting yourself as the being you desire to be thereby allowing you to live a life that is rewarding, fulfilling in many ways in whatever form it takes productive and satisfying for the idea is you will continue to create your own reality anyway why not at least entertain the idea of interjecting some desire, interjecting some purposefulness, interjecting or deciding in that sense to have your life be a purposeful reflection of who you know yourself to be. And so many of our discussions take the tone of elucidating and discussing the mechanism through which you create your own reality already and now beginning to do so according to preference by way of a very brief review, keeping it as simple as as you say possible. In each and every moment you decide who you are. You then trust that decision perhaps you can say over time and you then act as though you trust that decision and this is something you automatically do when you begin to impose the idea of purposefulness and be conscious about that decision then the trust in the decisions and the actions become consistent with the decision and those are the things that make the statements that give you the feedback that you call your experience or your life. And so therefore always are you making in each and every given moment a decision I am this person I do this type of thing I react or act in this type of way and on and on and on. You do this automatically we are discussing doing it purposefully at first for when you begin to live who you are consciously and purposefully it also seems to become automatic over time thereby being effortless and natural sometimes when you first begin in that sense to begin to live consciously and make your decisions consciously it can take on the tone of feeling as though there is effort involved for so long have you made your decisions automatically and perhaps in many ways seemingly unconsciously that it can seem a bit strange at first to make your own conscious decisions however the thing that allows you to have your reality come to fruition according to your decision if indeed you are experiencing some seeming difficulty in the transition it's simply the idea of persistence itself being willing to commit to the decision of who you know yourself to be and persist in maintaining the decision of who you know yourself to be not allowing anything to talk you out of it for if you do allow something to talk you out of it so to speak always still the result of that is that you change your decision well I must not be this person I must be that person and that is in and of itself a decision so always are you making a decision about who you are when you begin to entertain the notion of having the decision be conscious and according to preference you have a very convenient barometer a very convenient shall I say neither that allows you to align to who you are in any given situation and we have discussed this using the term you call excitement for the things that you are truly excited about and can act upon with integrity allows you to know in no uncertain terms that that is from whatever is available in any given situation or timing most you and so therefore we define excitement as that vibration that vibrational discernment that allows you to know that this is most me and that is why I am passionate moved excited stimulated about this particular thing you always make the decision I am this person utilizing the unique set of options in any given moment and situation and so another way to put this is that you always choose your decision from options that are available allow me to entitle in that sense this interaction an exciting option for you can use your excitement in the decision making process understanding that whatever you choose will be perhaps you can say committing to one of the many available options and always in every given moment from all of the options that are uniquely available in that moment will one or a few of them stand out as obviously being more exciting obviously being more compelling and therefore by extension from our definition obviously a true reflection of who you truly know yourself to be and it will always be up to you to choose an exciting option versus any of the other options that you choose for whatever rationale or reason you assign for choosing them though choose you will for you always decide you always define yourself it is part of the idea of physical creation it is part of the idea of the separation from complete knowing this and separation allows you to reflect back on who you are and see yourself from seemingly an external point of view therefore of the options again one or several will always stand out as being more compelling or exciting and your willingness to entertain that option and in fact go further and act upon it is what will allow you to cut through much of the red tape that you seem to create in your reality and simply be a living expression of who you are understand if you choose an option that is not at all exciting that is not a reflection of who you are you do so in lieu of the exciting option which is more akin to who you are and so therefore if you continually make decisions according to some other criteria you literally take up your time expressing yourself not in preferred terms not at the being you wish to be and in that sense are using that time to do something else other than the most conducive thing that you have decided that you would like to do or being the person you decide you would like to be and so always are you deciding something always are you trusting something always are you doing something and if that something is not a representation of who you wish to be you are using that time instead of being who you are so to speak and so always will it seem to take the decision to commit to your excitement and thereby seem to leave other things behind but when you leave those things behind you make more room you make more time to express yourself as the being you say you prefer and many of the things that you hold on to out of what you call a sense of security actually take up the time that you could be as you say spending so to speak to express yourself and get the results you say you desire therefore when deciding that you are perhaps slightly different from who everyone thinks you were from who you had presented yourself to be there is the apparent that you may stop doing certain things and we understand that again these things may represent the idea that you call security but I remind you if something is providing any degree of security to you that is truly not a reflection of who you are there is no reason to assume that something that is a representation of who you are would support you any less and in fact it makes most logical sense that are you to leave behind those things that are no longer representative of who you are and embrace and revel and jump into the ideas that you know yourself to be that you will see that change immediately and you will find that nothing is lost but quite the contrary everything is gained you've made room you've made time in that sense have made your decision be more shall I say committed to being who you are and trusting that if who you are not has supported you in any way that who you are can only support you at least that much but I will go ahead and tell you that it can support you far more for when your output becomes your work and that is your joy then you are literally being paid to be who you are in the way that your society creates exchange and abundance and so therefore anything that you find most exciting can be lucrative if you allow it to be can support you if you allow it to be and need not be understood in the terms that everybody knows if you do this you get that that type of thinking is counterproductive to understanding that anything that excites you can support you if you commit to it and if in that sense you dive into it with no hesitation therefore it's all right at your fingertips as you say and always from any set of options in any given moment and I remind you each and every moment has a unique set of options that are particular to that moment always will there be something that stands out as being more exciting now there may be the occasional incident where of the things available the most exciting thing is not truly an overwhelming exciting thing but that is not really that important it is the most exciting thing from what's available that you have the ability to act upon in that moment with integrity that allows you to get the result no matter if that excitement is as you say barely perceptible or absolutely overwhelming so therefore doing what excites you the most with integrity from whatever is available in any given moment is the quickest way to take everything that we have ever discussed with you and put it into action right now which is the only time there is therefore as we proceed to what you call the interaction my simple suggestion would be the idea of always allowing yourself the advantage of observing all of the options that are available and allowing yourself to choose an exciting option for that is the option that will bring you what it is you say you desire regardless of if that action and circumstance has anything seeming to do with that overall thing that you desire or not for everything that excites you is actually connected and if it is in surface evidence that it has anything to do with another thing that excites you you may understand that it is the excitement itself about it that tells you that they are connected and very often things that seem completely unconnected are the very things that put together the groundwork and foundation that allow you to do other things that you say excite now just briefly for those who may think they are new to these interactions the idea of acting according to your excitement with integrity there is shall I say a small explanation for the idea of integrity is not necessarily someone set of morals for that is very arbitrary obviously what we mean by integrity is simply the no weakness the knowledge that everything is a reflection of you and is one integrated whole unit expressing itself in a multitude of ways but one whole unit and therefore literally everything is an integration statement or it integrated with each other and so understanding this and then acting with the demeanor that honors that everything is an integrated whole is what we mean by integrity and generally that will seem to take the form of what you call moral behavior though again the idea you call morals are quite arbitrary and sometimes can be completely contradictory depending upon whose morals we are disconting so therefore integrity as stemming from the word integration of the whole is a little bit more understandable in each and every moment when you are deciding what excites you is that in that sense allowing you to express yourself with complete reverence and honoring of the whole therefore again gives the idea of integrity a slightly different twist and also makes it a bit more usable for your willingness to share with us an exciting option allowing us to interact with you in this unconventional format many years before we will physically interact I thank you for we do not take this lightly well perhaps you can say in many ways we do take this lightly in terms of the fact that we are not very serious about anything that we do but we are committed and we are dedicated simply that we treat our reality in a light way and do not ever get as you say heavy about things and this is not because of the gravity on our planet it is purely an attitude when you are wow yourself to lighten up you become enlightened a coincidence of language nevertheless very accurate and true and so therefore in return for your willingness to share the gift of the consciousness that you are with me and the members of my civilization when that sense are piped in and ready and willing to listen and interact through what you would call me so to speak I thank you and I ask you how we may mutually be of service to each other by sharing sharing. It is. Greetings. Yes it has been a long time. Not really but I know what you mean. Proceed. First of all I want to send my love to you and also to Bashar how it is easy to say. All perfect as you might imagine. Receive and return in kind. A lot of exciting things have been happening in my life and I want you to help me with one little area of my life puzzle that I am having a hard time realizing in my own mind. That is the statement that you have made so often about our bodies being contained within our consciousness. Oh. The other way around. A. If all of our individual consciousnesses are connected without anybody then is the purpose of coming into our bodies so that through our life creating we can come can compartmentalize lots of our reality which we constantly create moment to moment and through discovery of belief systems learn and discover how to integrate all of our decisions on all levels. That is certainly one way to look at. To understand the paradox of how this plays out however when I say your body exists within your consciousness. From your perspective everyone else's body everyone else's consciousness also exists within your consciousness. However from each of their own perspective you exist and they and their bodies within their consciousness. Now I understand this is paradoxical. It is the type of explanation that doesn't lend itself to easy comprehension in finite terms. However when you begin to grapple in that sense with infinite terminology some things that would seem to have been either this or that actually wind up being this and that and it may be a little bit more difficult to understand but if you open your mind up you can get a sense of the fact of how such a thing is possible. So therefore what you are sharing is one of the ways to express the breakdown in gradient of consciousness and then the interaction of the seemingly separate consciousnesses. Is there something specific you wish to know? I just wondered before we're born into this body our consciousness is by the way you are not literally are not in that body. This is one of the reasons that we say your body is within your consciousness to give you a sense of the fact that though you are focused to create the appearance of existing within a body that the mere fact that you can understand the idea that your body actually exists within your consciousness allows you to know and know in certain terms that you do grasp on some fundamental level the size the largeness so to speak this is very arbitrary of your consciousness and so even the idea of coming down into these bodies would not be an accurate representation it is more as though you are expressing yourself as that body in addition to the many other ways that you express yourself. From the perspective of expressing yourself as that body it seems as though that is the only way you are expressing yourself but when you begin to entertain many of these more expanded concepts you can even experientially get a sense of how much larger you actually are and actually experience the idea of your body seemingly or simply rather being a mere point and perhaps you can say arbitrarily the middle of your very infinite consciousness. It is a function of exchange that can be viewed in many ways one of the more fundamental ideas is that it simply represents the idea of balance the balance of what you call inflow and outflow or intuition and exploration or inspiration and exploration any way you wish to put it you may say in a sense it allows you to create a type of relationship with your environment or atmosphere by all means. We talk on this planet of being oh he or she is unbalanced I would imagine your fourth density you are a completely balanced perfect individual. Well we simply are willing to acknowledge that the individuals that you judge as being unbalanced are perfectly balanced expressions of whatever it is they are exploring and expressing and it may seem to be paradoxically an expression of being unbalanced but that is simply someone else's judgment call. So balance is the same as the integration of all the polarities that we are ever going to do to discover. In a sense though we will be experienced by individuals in very specifically individual ways. A person can understand themselves to be in perfect balance and have that experience and perception in their lives and others can think they are absolutely insane. So it is very arbitrageous. I have one last question that I hope you will be able to help me with. Hoping flies out do proceeds. In one of our past discussions we talked about Tom's and my lifetime during the French Revolution. Was I a female then and Tom a male? Why do you not straighten out that question mark to an exclamation point and tell me? Because I might have been a male and he might have been a female. Which is it that you most strongly perceive however? Well I thought I was female but then when he talks about my having cut his head off I was I a personal executioner. I might have been the person that dropped the guillotine and not someone behind the thing who is kind to another word I can't imagine myself being an executioner. Do understand that who you are now is unique and specific. That you have all lived many many many many hundreds of lives. You may only perceive one or several of them for only will the one that have some relevance to what you are exploring now stand out. But literally you have done it all. Now I am not by the way confirming that you have done that and I will leave that specific designation up to you so that you can begin to develop your own sense of trust and discernment. But I will say that you have done it all. Things that you find most appalling things that you find most joyous. And so therefore as individuals in a society who is now transforming both individually and as a society it is not as though you have not already amassed a rich great amount of experience. The ideas of murder and so on and so forth all of you have participated in many times on both ends. If you do not remember them it is simply because it is so completely foreign to who you express yourself to be now. Just because we are going through a lot of healing work together right now on the integration of male and female polarities and that kind of thing but it still keeps sticking in my mind and my abhorrence to slicing myself in any way accidentally with something sharp. Oh I do you perceive that you would cut the head of that individual off now. No. Is that not all that matters? Well it is just that anger and that morning when he was sitting there reading the paper and we were having quite a heated discussion and I said why would you have any reason ever to fear me and he just looked up at me and said because you cut my head off and then he surprised himself you know he would not talk about it any longer than that. Why have this nagging feeling that maybe some of the anger that he still feels and being afraid to be really close to me on an inanimate level have to do with another lifetime when I access it. Alright. Understood and you know generally really fraying in that sense from giving much information again to allow you to explore but do allow me to say in this case it is my perception that he is experiencing a metaphor and that that would not be literally accurate. Now do understand the metaphor as you have it in your language you have bitten my head off and so forth. No it is that you cut the head off and you it's just you backed it up by saying we had a lifetime during the French Revolution and I said something about the guillotine and I said I yes so right away I I didn't know if I was somebody behind the scenes that had caused him to have it sent out or if I was the actual executioner there because the last time we were down in Florida we had occasion to who was a young man there I don't remember now where he was from boys allowing people to wrap him up and change from what she was going to was case and I volunteered to be one of the people that go up and really wrap him up and checkies and I will never ever do that again. All right why not because well it was the most awful thing and he kept saying make him tired and he had him round his neck and all I could feel it was like I was doing it to myself. All right. And another lifetime I thought maybe I had been in chains or something it was it was terribly the young man that was with me he said the same thing when we got done he would never ever do that again and then watching this poor man struggle to get out of these chains. All right. I thought that might have been from the same kind of a life. I do understand however and it is more literally visible that that was his choice and in another way of looking at it as you all have lived the many lives did participate perhaps through unconscious choice or not being willing to acknowledge that you can make conscious decisions about who you are many of these things did occur through the agreement of the allowances that were in place. Then the most shall I say important idea is right now who you are now what you would do now. You need not drag the path around as a ball and chain and I remind you once again that the present is not a result of the past one series of events may lead to a condition or experience but how that experience is then had how it is interpreted and what you do is always up to you. And so the path does not result in the present or have influence on the present until you build into your decision that it does and simply in a case like that whether such a thing occurred or not the willingness to forgive and move on and be in the moment is the result. I have your telepathic phone numbers so I may contact you directly whenever I want to share. You already have it. How do I do that? You simply in that sense close your eyes and relax in your case have a dialogue and trust what you get and to whatever degree you trust what you get act upon it. That is what allows as you say the connection between us to strengthen when you use the information it is in that sense a statement of trust that allows you from your end to widen the ability to communicate but the idea is you do not need assistance or help from me. Anything that you perceive is reflected to you from me originates from you to begin with or it would make no sense to you. So by all means place a call now and then though however perhaps more to simply give a progress report than a cry for help. You are completely the power that you need to be to in that sense express your life and anything that you hear and say how brilliant is simply you or it would make no sense to you. It would feel brilliant it would not seem brilliant and you would have no charge on it unless you first contained it and simply are awakening it within you. So therefore you already contain the phone the receiver the long distance call and the answer. I've done nothing thank you. Shitting. Hi. Hi. Gristi. Long time no talk to. All right. Nice to hear you. Nice to send you as well. Okay I have some maybe silly questions. The first one sent a silly. I know. All right no such thing do proceed. Well you said I think you said that Andrew is your past self or your. In one way of looking at it. So my question to you is assuming that that's not 100% the total of who you were on earth. With your life on earth did you have the same difficulty we or myself is having in putting some of these concepts into practice. The idea is that I was through the life of Andrew able to reality test our concepts here and what you would perceive as difficulties what you would perceive as challenges. I have already lived and so therefore I speak with a certain degree of authority even though where I am now many of the ideas of negativity that you explore individually and society are completely irrelevant to our exploration because I and others of my society have lived singular lies on your planet as members of your society. That gives us the knowledge that what we say to you is absolutely 100% applicable. Are you saying did I as Andrew have what you would perceive or what Andrew would have perceived to be troubles absolutely. And in that sense would not have been able to truly reality test the idea unless I truly abided by all the limitations that you in that sense express as humans. Now not to give away the ending of Andrew's story but shall I say the outlook is very sunny and that applies to all of you as well. I can perceive this that is true. This I guess you would say are a start. Yes. I just need a glimmer you know. A glimmer of who you are alright. So okay thank you. Thank you. Can you tell me anything about archetypes and spirit guides and angels in terms of well in any terms you want. And is it something that you have access to in your world or we have our own version of what you would perhaps refer to as archetypes. The idea of angels and spirit guides from our perspective would have a slightly different experience for the idea is we are more aware of varying realms and dimensions of consciousness and so therefore to up there are not so perhaps you would say a theory. They're more solid in terms of archetypes they are merely tendencies or shall I say math agreed upon anchors or pivotal ideas that are expressed through everyone so to speak in their own individual way to keep it quite general. There's something specific you are seeking. Well I guess it to my limited mind you know an archetype is just some mythological figure that appeared in a book. Well in a sense you can say it is perhaps the origin of any idea and archetypes of a mythological figure would be the first presentation that was then retold in many different ways down through what you call the many millennia of your society. I guess the confusing concept for me was because I thought that was what it was not really anything that could have existed. Very few times I have actually experienced what I would say would be the archetypal energy of let's say iseth, feminine whatever whatever you call. I would beg to differ with you. You have experienced this many times. Perhaps simply not called at that or perhaps in such a natural way that you assume that did not represent such an archetype. Okay so all right. So well the few times I was aware of it as being a very powerful something that came from some other place. This is making much sense. Then it became very real to me and other people have experienced that energy. Oh but now is the time to trust who you are without the need in that sense for the external validation. In many ways you are correct in assuming that an archetype being a pivotal common point will lend itself to much external validation. Do you feel the continued necessity for such validation understanding that only will your transformation occur with complete internal validation and once you do that the external validation has only ever been a reflection of the degree to which you internally validate or invalidate yourself to begin with. I think just to bring it back home. I think I'm some love of life. I heard you. The idea is validate yourself and everything else will follow. Conversely invalidate yourself and everything else will follow. So it's my own security that needed to like find out what this archetype is. It's the idea of you are the decision maker. Here are your options. The power lies with your ability to choose any option. No option has more weight. And so therefore you can choose to express yourself right now in those terms that need not have external validation which again will always come later because the real mechanism in play according to consciousness expression is believing is seeing. Is this making more sense? Yeah. I still want you to say like an archetype is this person that existed in you know 500 feet in that without our this will vary and it would be a disservice to actually nail it down to something also much of what would be considered the ultimate archetypes. Don't have translations in any of your languages for your civilization is far older than you imagine. So can I just go by the time what you call for instance as an example your story of Noah and the arc reached what you call your Bible. It is already a retold tale from many different civilizations farther and farther back into your history and was actually perhaps you can say a representation of a particular event though not exactly the event it portrays. There was what you call a very shall I say in. Yes local flooding which made it appear to those in the area as though the whole world was flooded. Yes. All right. That's good. There was no period from our perspective and understanding of your history where your entire world was submerged in that way while there was life upon it. The local reporters just picked it up and magnified you have a game called telephone. Long line of people one individual whispers something into the ear of the one next to them by the time it gets down the line generally it does not even resemble the original story. Here you have a small group of people right next to each other. Can you just imagine what happens over the millennia. Many of your stories do contain elements of the actual event if there was one. Often they are completely distorted from the actual event though each distortion. Each distortion serves a purpose. The way that you get the story is the way that will in that sense benefit you the most anyway so it all works out in the end. Is there something else? Yes. All right. Keep going. I just asked. Okay. This one is personal. Given what you were talking about about the action. It's two things are exciting. There are times when I want to know where fear of commitment, accountability, responsibility might kind of obliterate or diminish the excitement of a certain choice. Oh I'm understanding again that fear and anxiety are the same vibration one with a positive trust one with a negative trust. Can I get you an example? By only two choices. Yoga teacher training was very exciting to me and if I can get rid of the what would I do with it, how would I do it? Oh my goodness. By the way you can't get rid of that. You can't get rid of anything. Where will you put it? It's minimized it. The idea is that it becomes irrelevant because you are focusing on something else. Not running from this. It's so affixed to this that this is no longer visible. It is not gone. There's nowhere to put it. You're everything. It is simply irrelevant. So therefore do not focus on it and rather than even saying do not focus on it, focus on something else. This is where the exciting option comes up. This is where your ability to define yourself comes up. Decide who it is you want to be and make that the point of your focus. Everything else goes into the periphery where it cannot be seen at all. Still there, still honored, still valid but irrelevant to your choice. Okay but very specifically we have this yoga teacher stuff. And then there is something called an earth walk which involves like 10 sessions of doing some very deep shamanic journey and reiki and energy work. And that's really exciting. But that to me has no practical consequence down the road. I can't translate that into something except that's very exciting. So my question is one of the reasons that's so exciting is I can't give it a label later on is what I'm going to have to do with it so it doesn't have the commitment thing in it. I do understand the idea of attaching a desperation that what excites you must pay off in that sense. However, the idea is to follow the excitement nevertheless and the pay off is incidental. Perhaps using your own example my question to you would be which one is more available. At the moment, the earth walk. That is another indication. In other words, as I have said, of all the options available one or sometimes several will stand out as being more exciting. Now here is the opportunity to discuss what happens when it is several of the several things that are exciting invariably one will stand out in that timing as being most able to act upon. That is the sign. That tells you in that moment the thing I can act upon, the thing that is available right now allows that one thing to stand out from the others. And so in my own experience without all the other baggage that you have named I would simply choose the thing that was most available. Well, not necessarily let go. You will find your entire range of opportunities changes once you begin to act on the things that excite you. For now you are doing something purposefully that represents who you know yourself to be. You are most conducive able to express yourself when you are walking in sync or in step with who you are. You perform actions while you are engaged and while you are excited and these actions have repercussions or shall I say results that bring up new sets of options and this is how the face of your experience changes when you begin to follow your excitement. The idea is not so much only discerning this excites me but when you act on that excitement you put out and when you put out according to that vibration that is what you begin to see coming back so to speak. So therefore as long as what you are doing is exciting it will lead to other exciting options that wouldn't have been there if you had not done that and that is why things change. If you do not do that and go as you say status quo that is why things seem not to change because your actions will continue to be reflective of things that are not according to preference not a reflection of who you desire to be and they will have results and those results will come back seeming to you as evidence. So it is a matter of determining who you are. Maintaining the focus on that no matter what the evidence seems to say for the evidence is all dated old evidence from actions that you have performed perhaps you can say before that is the appearance anyway and if you allow those to play out the new results catch up with you so to speak does that make sense. That is why it may seem when you transit over to this type of approach that there may be a period of difficulty and what I had said at the beginning of this interaction was the key is persistence. Persist in focusing on who you know yourself to be no matter what any of the outer evidence seems to dictate and the evidence will catch up to who you know yourself to be. Perfect thank you. Oh thank you. Shitting. Hey. And who you good day. I have a new age joke to share with you and your esthensonie friends. Oh right. Are they listening. Let me check. All right just for you. Hey say those that are attuned to that vibration. This fundamentalist approach this guru and pointed his finger at the guru and said I think you're an atheist and the guru after a pause answered. Well at one time I didn't think that until I realized I was gone. One moment. Allow me to say they're rolling in the aisle. That is very akin to our style of humor and I think. Would you share a business on your with us. Perhaps one moment. All right two individuals walking down what you would call a road and one individual says to the other. What would you like to be when you grow up. The other individual responds more of myself. That is the punch. And they are also rolling in the aisle. We do a lot of rolling. I have a question. Oh what. I wanted to ask what energy source do you use for your scalp craft. Is that the same as used for your mother's ships. There are different ways to look at this. What you might perceive on the most fundamental level is that the fuel source where you to call it that is pure light. But it is not necessarily light as you understand it for light. White light pervades all space and all time. We are able in that sense to attenuate perhaps you can say our machinery this is very arbitrarily worded for your convenience to be able to utilize it on all levels. So for the purposes of keeping it simple that will be my answer. I do understand most fundamentally that consciousness is light. Proceed. That's interesting that that leads into my next idea or question. Mary and I last night attended a meeting held by Colin Andrews who as you know since maybe 1983 has devoted his whole working life to studying cross circles. He had a very short video maybe it was only 15, 20 seconds long maybe but it showed the formation of what you call a circle by extraterrestrial means. Right right on. How did you know that? Just a coincidence. By the way it is not the first of such thing though it may be one of the first to get what you call publicity. It showed two white lights circling around and while they were doing that in about maybe only three seconds we could actually see the crop circles being formed. And I guess my question is well Colin Andrews felt that the white lights were maybe roughly 18 inches diameter and my question is what was. Okay. Yeah we missed it there. Ooh how was the Christmas? From my perspective you did not. You got exactly what you need. Are you ready to book these? Don't die on your craft circle. Darn. Alright is your machinery prepared? Alright. When you tell a port let's say from a society to get into our neighborhood. Alright perhaps you can say dimensionally relocate to be specifically more accurate. You change your coordinates in the universe. We change one specific element of the vibration that corresponds to time and space and pull. Now let's say you have two other comrades or coworkers in your scout craft. Do you all together synchronize and do what you do to the idea is that from inside our craft the apparently is that there is an isolation field that is emitted around the craft. And so from the perspective of the occupants it would seem to relocate as a unit. All of us together. The same kind of source. The same kind of thing happens when your mother's ship with it. The same type of thing. Which also all of these crafts can also in that sense propel themselves in ways that you are more accustomed to from point A to point B. So they have the option of utilizing both types of travel. I get that a lot. Thank you very much. Thank you for the joke. Shutting. Eugh. Nail. Greeting the line. And so you? Greeting. I guess well we have the attention of others I assume Beshar is there. Available in that sense. Well it has to do with him a little bit. Lately I have just been attracted to this tape. This meditation on the shot for us that he and Darryl had presented to us. And it's been fascinating to me. I wanted to ask you in your perspective and maybe his perspective too for some uses in it and exactly what is it doing when I am practicing or using this meditation. Well the idea is simply to expand your version of yourself. To expand your understanding of who you are. And that in that sense allows you to see yourself as more than you previously assumed you were. Perhaps you can say in many ways is a gradient to under your understanding yourself as the whole. It is merely perhaps you can say a gradient approach to expanding your perception of who you are. That's great exactly what is going on. I feel like a shift in my, every time I do it my visual imagery becomes more, it becomes stronger. It is very strongly aligning and in that sense in doing so generally we will put you up the conducive mindset to allow you to make decisions that are more conducive representative of who you know yourself to be. Still goes back to decision trust and action but by all means rebel in the process. So it changed, it should be my vibration of who I am. It's a method of alignment for you. Ultimately what are you aligning to you might ask and I answer you are aligning to the decision of who you are. So as a finishing touch after this meditation what else can I do? Make the decision of who you are and get shaking. It's been great. I want to know this. So I want to thank the Sharpe for that because I felt I kind of merged with him in a way I never have before at this point. Oh why did any process is only as good as the participants willingness to use it? So you are thanked as well. I had a really neat dream of him the other night and I never dreamt of him that is at least where I'm aware of. All right. Do you wish to share it? Well he was a short one but we were in obsession and he was. By the way he is a short one. It was short. But you were saying that she actually couldn't really tell but there was another guy sharing and I know it's all made which is funny but this guy was describing his question and Beshar couldn't understand what he was trying to ask and I was viewing it from like a transatlantic field I was just kind of floating out there watching this happen and Beshar had to stop and ask assistance to somebody else. What is this guy saying? That was about all my. How brilliant. That was really it and I woke up just in the sense of how that was Beshar and I remember and really touched him in that way. How did it feel? It felt different than you. It felt wonderful. Well he was quite different than you. Quite a character is that Beshar. I'm not sure. Okay. And he was absolutely. He mentioned in that meditation that about the alpha state and I wanted to ask you about that like what? I've been attracting that word everywhere I look I keep seeing the alpha. The word. The first letter in the alphabet. The primary source simply represents in this case a vibratory state of awareness which can be achieved in but a moment's time of aligning to who you are. In many ways a pragmatic way to use it is that when you are being who you are fully, purposefully you are in a consistent alpha state so to speak. I've been wondering why that's popped up now for me. It's allowing you again in the tools that you are creating to align. Tool of alignment but ultimately it is you doing the alignment. Not the tool. Yeah to me it felt more like a grounding for me like a starting point of something where my power really comes from and when I exert that it's coming from my alpha place. That's all there is to it. You already did. Would you like to ask something else? Of course he is. It's about another dream I've had about this black wolf that seems to be chasing me and I wanted to hear your interpretation of that and other than the symbology of that. Can you help me with that? And the idea that you can be overwhelmed which you cannot and are you too in that sense turn and face the wolf again then you will understand what I am saying. It is simply you running from yourself in most literal terms but when you face yourself always is there a pleasant gift and surprise. Yeah it's just reoccurring. It has been reoccurring for a long time now. Do you recall turning around to face it? Yeah. All right. And he was I turned around to face him and then he chased me when he was just walking behind me. Then he started to chase me and I found a tree and I climbed up the tree. Oh, like perhaps that is not a representation of continuing to face it. No, I'm not. Hold your ground. I was scared. All right. Understood. Hold your ground. Understand when you do there is the gift. Yeah. He's been my friend before but I never did. He is a symbol of the very strength that you are. And so therefore cannot possibly overwhelm you. Yeah, a little bite away. All right. You may find again that will not occur. Perhaps you'll simply take a good licking. All right. At this timing allow us to pause for a short break and resume contact at your convenience. I will not do it as it will me until...
