 All right, I'll say, how are you all this evening of your time as you create time to exist? Are you all alive? Thank you very much. We begin this interaction this evening of your time with the following entitlement, if you wish, present time. There have been, in your experience, many ideas. It is no accident that you are present for and within this interaction, whether that presence be physically present, whether it be astraly present, whether it be simply experiencing the idea of this interaction, in your tape format, your video format, it is no accident that you are now participating in this interaction at this time. Your very presence, your very awareness is in and of itself all the prerequisite that you only need to understand the idea on some level that we will communicate to you this evening of your time. Very often members of your society have inquired from members of our society. The idea that we do exist within the next dimensional realm. You are, as we have said, third density, or as you sometimes say, within your vernacular third dimension. We are fourth density or fourth dimension, as you say. Many of you have inquired from us what it is that does distinguish the idea of being within third density and which allows you to transform into fourth. Very much the idea that we will impart to you this evening of your time is the key that if you do turn, it is always your choice. Nothing will be forced upon you ever from our stream. It will unlock your present reality and allow you to change drastically in, as you say, the twinkling of an eye. For it is that simple and simply your conscious awareness being brought to particular idea allows you, as you say, to transform. Therefore, the notion we shall share with you this evening of your time may be new to some of you, may not be new to others. However, even if you have any sense heard this idea before, it will be in a very sense the first time. When we impart it, do not place expectations as to what you must get out of such an idea for, however, and whatever your imagination does do. However, it changes it. However, it alters it. Is your particular personalized method for integrating it? And again, it is not as though, at first, if you feel, well, I conceptually understand what you are saying, I intellectually understand what you are saying, but you do not feel that you emotionally feel it, do not worry, for everything occurs in and within its own timing. We have said many times, one of the key explorations within this type of existence you have chosen to explore is the idea of timing and illusion, except while you are creating, seems very real. Therefore, again, do not place expectations upon yourself that you have not gotten it, you have. Otherwise, you would not be present in this interaction this evening of your timing. We are shared with you the idea of how many individuals within and without your society, that the only experiential time that you do ever have, ever create, ever exist within is present time. Now, now is the only experiential time that you exist within always, the paradox being that it is always now. Creation is at the same time, already existing, and at the same time, being created anew. This idea of paradox, seeming things which cannot be mentally reconciled, is a symptom of forced density, the recognition of paradox, the recognition that it is not this or that, it is this and that which do you prefer. The idea that we shall share with you is as real as its converse, is as real as its adverse. It is just as real and valid a reality, as the reality you have chosen to explore, which you may consider up till now has been the opposite of this idea, though not really. Therefore, realizing that all ideas have validity, all ideas are real, and again this or that but both, and you get to pick, we shall then present to you this idea which will allow you to unlock from what you have considered the quote, trappings of your reality. There are many experiences that occur within your society, that given individual the idea that they are within a trapping cycle of existence whereby things are repetitive, whereby it is not that things are always created anew. That is a valid viewpoint, you have experienced it so you know it has substance, it has reality, but just as real as that idea is the idea that in any given moment you are creating anew your entire reality. The idea of kind that you are experiencing has an apparent of continuity. That moment leading to the next, on the next moment leading to the next, that is the nature of the illusion as you have heard timing call the illusion of continuously, the illusion of being a continuum. In another perspective, just as valid, it may be stated that your reality is recreated each and every now moment, a distinct recreation, a distinct new reality. When you do by into the continuum theory, you do in a sense bind yourself up to the effects of that continuum theory. When you proceed in action with the idea of time being continuous, then you are bound by your perception of that continuity. The notion we shall share with you made it sound be what you label, a revelation for it will rewire in a very real sense your brain. This again will never be done against your will. When we shall utter the phrase, you shall absorb it at your own rate and only with your own allowance. Therefore, the idea again, your scientists have begun to understand that each thought that you have literally creates new pathways in your brain. I am not saying that pathways which are there are being used and different pathways which are there are then being used from thought to thought. I am saying that pathways are created where there were none before. That pathways that did exist are no longer there. This is more the reality of the nature of your use, physical use of your brain. This is one of the reasons that your scientists have, so am I, that you only use a small portion of your brain now. From our perspective, you always use 100% of your brain, even if you use 90 to make it seem as if you are only using 10. You are always using 100%. With your present technology, much of this idea is unmeasurable. However, when a brain is simultaneously, suddenly, totally realigned in the moment, you refer to this phenomenon as revelation and you do in a very real sense emerge from this idea a new person, a completely new person. You may create the illusion of continuity if you wish. You may because you are not ready to be 100% a new person. You choose to use that continuity to ground yourself, to allow yourself to maintain individuality so to speak. However, it is a new and although you are creating the new you with the thought that it is connected to the old you, it is only your belief that it is connected, that connected. So therefore, it is connected if you believe it is. If you do not, it is not connected. Therefore, again, we shall flash this evening of your time a seed, a crystalline seed. You will provide in your own imagination, in your own experience, the soil, the fertilizer, the water, the light. Then, again, according to your own particular timing, the seed will burst forth a blossom that will not be the reality you have known. The reality you can create will be if you choose according to your conscious preference. You no longer need to experience anything in your reality you do not prefer unless you believe that you must, then you must, but only when that is the underlying belief. Therefore, again, relax, allow this to be delivered to you in whatever way you will accept it. Like that whenever you are involved in any interaction, that your imagination, putting in its feedback, adding little things within your mind, within your consciousness is not an interruption. It is part of your learning, part of your growth and your acceptance and willingness to validate what you get is what allows it to forminate, most quickly, as you say, and seem to, desire. Quick transformation toward that which you do prefer. Therefore, we shall continue with this idea. Allow yourself to relax. Close your eyes if you wish. Take a deep loving breath followed by two more deep and loving breath, allowing yourself to relax. When you do feel yourself at the center of your being, simply again, allow what we are about to utter to dance within your consciousness to play with your imagination. If at all afterwards, as you say, any questions about this idea, please ask. We wish that you are the clarifying for this simple, singular notion is the key, as we have said, to unlock your present reality and allow you to walk in a very real sense into force density now. Therefore, as you do, allow yourself to relax, as you do again sink into the center of your being, as you do create within your imagination the idea of your play of perfect. Peace. We shall now simply utter this idea. Your present is not a result of your past. Your present is not a result of your past. Your present is not a result of your past. Your present is not a result of your past. Now allowing this idea to swim within the sea of your imagination. Allow yourself to react to your surroundings. Allow yourself to absorb at whatever rate you will this idea. As you do, find yourself drifting back. You may then again open your eyes and allow your surroundings to fill you back up. You realize you are not the same person you were when you closed your eyes simply only as you will continue to create it to be that way, but very literally not the same person. And by the way, happy birthday. Now before we do proceed with the sharing, we have one brief message. In a moment. All right, I'll say to you this evening of your time greetings, my nomenclature that I have within your society, claimed as my own although we have no names per se, is Anima. We have chosen that particular vibration as our label for it very literally within your society does mean a female aspect as expressed by a male. Therefore, I am also a discrete being upon the same planet, if you will, as the shard. We are contemporary beings within the same society. And I simply have joined you this evening to allow you to share in this idea. You have heard very, very many times within your reality, the idea of one being the masculine and feminine size in your personality for each individual does, even though you have expressed yourself physically as a particular polarity, a particular gender. Each does contain both your higher self, your over soul is both. In a sense, the dichotomy is simply the exploration of polarity. But you may realize and recognize this in a practical way by simply considering that. We will simplify this greatly and in your quote, future may elaborate upon this but for now the idea of that your female energy side per se can be expressed by the idea of receptivity, by the idea of willingness to interact with your environment in such a way to receive and wow the inflow of information and allow yourself not only to listen to information but to hear it also. But we see that there is a distinction with this idea. Then the idea of your male aspect or personality or construct of your overall being may be expressed again simply as your aggressiveness, your willingness to act. Therefore the brief message we wish to share with you this evening of your time is as follows. Our stream in communicating with your society has desire to point out to you that options available to you are to use your excitement, what excites you, what floats your boat as the criteria for how to proceed in your life. Realizing that along with proceeding in that manner, you get three things. A, you get what is most you. You are excited about it. It must be a reflection of who you are. Down inside, B, it is most effortless, needless to say, if you are enjoying yourself, does not take a lot of effort. And C, and this may interest many of you from our perceptions of your society. The thing that excites you, brings along with it any and all of the abundance that you would need to do that particular thing. Therefore it is itself supporting structure. It is a non-failing way to proceed, be the best you you can be. And at the same time, put out, serve and live your life. Therefore we shall bring these two ideas together and blend and balance them in saying this. When functioning within your excitement, it is a prime opportunity for you to blend your female and male aspects. For you do use your female aspect to detect, to receive your excitement. Step one would always be to determine what does excite you. Many of you do get hung up at that step. But the idea being that by exercising your willingness to allow yourself to explore the idea and receive what it is that does excite you, you are exercising your female energy. Then now that you know what it is that excites you, you may then blend it with your male energy. For when something does excite you, generally, you don't just sit around and do nothing. The male energy, so to speak, is what allows you to then act upon what it is that excites you. So by simply realizing what it is that excites you and then acting upon it, you are blending these energies in a most effective way. Many of the ideas of integration that you seek for you feel your scattered being, some of them, will automatically take place when following your excitement. For you are combining and blending those two energies. Therefore we do say to you to go in love and life and do what does excite you. In the idea of future interaction, we shall again speak to you. Thank you very much for your time. All right, I'll say, Shanny, we have the show. We have the idea, generally, within your society, that you refer to as the Orion energy generation, the We ask that you would tell the story of Orion. We know that it was a wonderful story. All right. The idea, generally within your society, that you refer to as Orion energy, although there are exceptions, has to do with the idea of integration of negativity. The symbology of the Orion system may be most closely associated with your society to the idea of the exploration of extreme negativity. The symptoms, the outcome of this extreme negativity is rigidization, structuralization, to the point that you might label within your society, fascism. Therefore, you have had examples of the Orion mode of thinking in your society. But shall we say, the actual Orion event is a bit more negative. This, however, even within your flow of time, is history. For now, within the Orion system, there is the presence of life. There is the presence of truth. There is the introduction of unconditional love. So therefore, what the Orion energy most strongly relates to within your society now is the integration of negativity. And there have been many structures upon your society that have shall we say been influenced by Orion energy in a sense. Realize, none of you are inherently native to your planet. You are in a very real sense star our children. And although you have lived many thousands of lives consecutively upon your Earth, you are not shall we say born in a sense here. And you have existed in other systems, existed in this system, and may, if you choose to create it, exist again in other systems. Again, this is very colloquial. But the idea is that within your society, individual have, in a sense, reincarnated as you understand that term from the Orion civilization. One of these shall we say, and we do not mean that the wrong is orally, as much as an observation. We do not mean to shred on any toes with a statement, but an example within your society. Of shall we say the initiation of blending that energy as an institution you label, Scientology. That type of structure is a very heavily Orion influenced structure. Do you understand that nomenclature? Yeah. All right. Does that answer the question? Basically, I'd like to ask you it. Does it mean that someone who you may need on the street or know who has a very negative attitude, maybe doing very negative things, would be someone who had come from that energy, surrounding energy? Not necessarily. It may be the idea of that idea. But you also, as a society, shall we say, have, at least up to now, explored heavily, negativity. Then for it could be either ideas. Now, as a matter of interact, as you say, the polar opposite of the Orion energy is the idea that you have come to call in your society the alien energy for the Pleiadians, the civilization that doesn't, in a sense, originate from the system you labeled the Pleiadians, or very literally your brothers, sisters, and colleagues. Very literally. They look much as you do. However, when Orion did explore extreme negativity, where you did explore, shall we say, colloquially speaking, mediocre negativity, the Pleiadians are an example of extreme positivity, and hence their ability, shall we say, to travel and traverse time and space, for they are one of the civilizations very heavily involved with your civilization at this time. What's that else? Very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Share it. Be sure. Yes. How is it? It's beautiful. One moment. Can you all hear this individual? Speak up so that it all may share. I was going to get a close enough. And what we were wondering was, where is it now? One moment. What we are allowed to share at this time is that that individual, as you understand them, have reincarnated in your contemporary time, but that is all for a very specific reason that we shall share. So you have another question regarding that individual. If he's here now, what are you doing? You are, as you say, very sneaky. However, I must, in a sense, decline to elaborate. Thank you very much. Would you like another question to replace the one we would not ask? I don't know. I don't know. All right. We suggest don't work with it. Play and have a good time. Share it. I have a few questions from my life. I have these questions. Prote? I've seen what you would call, or they call on our few UFOs, I call them spaceship from other ships. We call them IFOs, Rosie. I need to know. I had one sighting that's always been me all my life, and I've never known whether it was real or not. And I thought I saw what I thought was a ship when I was in my childhood. Describe. It was a pensive glass windows, and I was living in Long Island, New York, in the early 60s. I cannot remember the dates or times, but I did see things that looked like us. I didn't see their faces because it was dark windows and lights blinking. And I'm not sure. I know as I went downstairs to tell the rest of the family that this was happening and nobody came up, and I looked out and I know I did with smile and then closed the shades and go to sleep. All right. I bet he has a great white handle, lots of situations. And realize the other, since you can only experience the reality you are, the vibration, we're not of the vibration to have such an experience. Proceed? I don't know whether to do any stuff that, is there any way I could meet these people directly at some time? In a sense you have. Can you describe subsequent events? All I can describe is about two years ago an event where I did see what I considered what you call an IFO or a mothership. It was a big, big vessel and it was a solid object and I was blinking lights and I was driving my car and I saw two little lights shoot out of it. And I watched the discverver here in Connecticut for at least 30 minutes and then I just, I tried to follow. It was going by I lost it, you know, and I traveled. What, what did you say the shape of the mother crap? And I couldn't tell, you know, it had many different angles to the bottom of it. It was very solid and it was very big. And I just, well, I was just watching and looking at all these lights and seeing nobody else was, you know, I was by myself and that was it. One moment. What we all allowed to share is this time and this fall, the findings that you have in a sense interacted with first of all from our perspective were real. Secondly, involved the civilization that we have just coincidentally mentioned, the Pleiadians. There is much information upon your planet available about interactions with the Pleiadians. Part of an exploration of any idea involves you utilizing within your reality the things that are available to you now. Therefore, our strong recommendation, as far as we will recommend an idea, is to get in touch with the information that is already there for that will allow you to open up the next door. You may, as you say, begin in the idea of your book, stores and we sense that you, although it may take a bit of time to pipe into it, we'll find the information that will lead you to the next step. Do you desire a next step? Yes, I do. Can you describe to me what that would be? I feel desire to do something more than I have done in the rest of my life, for most of my life, because of you, the connection I felt between my early childhood and this, I feel the connection to want to be with these people, since they are a part of me, I'm a part of them. Alright, let me suggest again, if life's out of docks. You have chosen with no bones about it to be here, for specific reasons, to explore specific ideas. Ironically, as you say, your best chance to facilitate such interactions would be to proceed as an earthling, living as fully as you can your earth life. For that puts out the vibration of your conscious recognition of your choice, and that is the very vibration which enables another civilization to touch you. Is that a service? Rosie, there is no limit. Will it ever be in contact with me again in some way? It is our perception that if you do absorb the essence of what we have just said, that that opportunity will be available to you, although, initially, you may find it too. Begin. In your dream reality. Simply realize your dream reality is no less real than this reality, other than the fact that that is a common belief in your society, that dreams of fantasy and that this is real. To us, this is the waking dream, just as real as the sleeping dream. Therefore, by opening up those lines of allowance, allowing yourself to experience within the dream reality, with the recognition that it is no less real, validating what you get within the dream reality, that will be a more direct initiation of these contacts, and in fact, it is our sense that you have had these communications, or you consciously aware of them, dreams of this nature. All right. Simply realize that the ones you need to be aware of, you will be. The ones you don't need to be aware of at that particular timing, do not worry about. That puts a lot of undue pressure on you. The information gleaned from your dream reality, most appropriately, comes out in the doing of your physical reality. When you do what excites you in any given moment, you are being the best you can be. You are the most consciously recognizing who you are and acting that way. That puts you all the vibration of total receptivity. So therefore, it is okay what I am saying is, it is okay to have your end in the cloud. Simply maintain your feet, firmly, on the ground at the same time. All right. Is something else that will only lie to cut us to you? Please do share. All right. Thank you very much. Shay. Hey. I have a question one night, my family and I were sitting outside watching the stars, and I saw something fly over our house very low that seemed to be transparent, and it just sort of whacked it over the house, and nobody else saw it. And I would just like to know what it's, what that could possibly be. And sometimes I have a feeling that my pet sees things. And they do. They are tuned, shall we say, in a different way. What was your perception at the time without invalidating it? I was sitting at school over the house. It looked like an angel. All right. And everyone was laughing at me and they said that I was seeing cellophane, and they were joking around and saw a thing on the bed. And all of that never allowed you to see you about what you had seen. Well, I felt kind of silly. But I really saw something. I'll run then even when, quote, invalidated from without. You did maintain your inner conviction. Very good. It is our perception that you did see something. In a sense, we will only loosely define what our sense of what it is was, but understand this in no uncertain terms. Your brain can only perceive what it is wired to perceive. Your eyes can only see what they are within the frequency range to see. Very often within the interactions between our society, our respective society, and your society. But all, as you say, spacecraft sighting taking place, where individuals are congregated in age. Common areas. And only certain individuals can see the craft. For that is their orientation. Can be that two individuals are standing right next to each other. One sees, one does not. It is again a matter of vibration. When that's undercurrent, you can realize that there is much less commonality between you than you realize. You are all truly in a real sense your own universe. And although you have made agreements in a sense with each other, to expand the end to each other's energy, they are not shall we say across the board agreements. There are variances, nuances in each particular agreement. What you label it in your not to be all saying that supplies to you in any way, shape or form, please understand. But what you have labeled in your society, insanity, where individuals do hallucinate. From our perspective, they are experiencing real, solid reality. No less real than this reality. No less real than the dream, reality. However, they are not within agreements with others, that the others will also experience that idea. And because your society has a tendency to be invalidational, rather than allowing that individual to express themselves, watch them up. Therefore what I am saying is do not worry so much about the idea of being normal. You worry so much in a sense, don't worry about being natural. If you saw it and you know you saw it, you saw it. And it does not matter who else did or did not see it. Individuals that vibrate at a similar rate to you will benefit from the information that you will impart having seen such a thing. And you will attract yourself as you have within this interaction into conducive atmospheres for discussing, integrating and understanding this energy. But for now we will lead you with this idea. What you saw was not so much a physicalized spacecraft. As a symbolic representation of a type of energy that does originate from a particular star system, you know as archivists. So you may begin in a sense to do your research, as we have suggested to that other individual, on archivists. That will allow you to understand some of what you have seen. Some of the ideas that have been labeled in your society, angels, are in a sense representations, symbolic representations of that stream of consciousness, are notorious. Is that a service? Thank you very much. Shady! Yes, Beshar. Can you tell us anything about the meteorite that we refer to as small device? Yes, and you may find this a bit interesting. Within your solar system, there is a space. You have labeled the asteroid belt. This particular space, in a sense, if you view the way your solar system lies out, seems to be missing a planet. It is. It now is inhabited by asteroids. These asteroids are the products of a planet, which did destroy itself. In a similar, though not exactly the same manner, that is available now to your society of such destruction. The name of that particular planet, in a sense, was Mount Deck. The mineral you are referring to as, mold device. More! Shall we say appropriately, might be labeled, Malzakite, for it is, in a sense, pieces of that planet. That planet was representative of NID. That of... You have played out upon your planet, a similar scenario. But this time, explored the possibility of such destruction, without... Shall we say, eradicating the entire planet? It is your Atlantean scenario. Now, you have an opportunity. That opportunity is to be within a somewhat similar set of circumstances, within your society, within your world at this time. But you now have the choice to not blow yourself to smithereens. What we have sensed, approximately 13 of the order years ago, and in fact, one of the ways that we have been allowed, in a sense, by you to communicate with you was from this decision, having been made, that your mass consciousness has decided to not destroy themselves by that means. Therefore, it is our perception that you are now playing out loosely speaking, the scenario by which you do not destroy yourself. Therefore, mold of light, as you say, is symbolic, and in a sense, can now be integrated to allow you to not play out that scenario. It's already been done. Does that help? Yes, thank you. Thank you very much. Sherry? Yes, for sure. Hey. To that mean that all of us, or many of us, were inhabitants of that planet at that time? Some, not all. Okay. All right, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Shady. Yes, for sure. Hey. Can you tell by sensing the energy of the individuals in this room, what dark systems or planets we mostly consume at this time as well? In a sense, that is a nebulous question, which can only yield, an nebulous answer. Forty-one existing, all of your lives right now simultaneously. So in a sense, you can pretty much take your things. Okay. Don't move the debate, but that's how it falls. Mostly, mostly those who choose to explore physicality. Shall we say, mix the rounds? More or less. Thank you. And most all individuals involved in this interaction have most recently been earthlings, for many lives consecutively as you lie out consecutive nets. Does that help or are we being a bit confusing? No, not at all. Can you tell if anyone who is in this room right now also is just on your planet? Yes. Maybe. Thank you very much. Shading! And don't be shy. Shading! Last time. One moment. You can view this as an extremely long-distance call, but you don't have to pay for it. Last time I heard a hear, I was telling you about an entity that appeared in our moment. Yes, very exciting. And after speaking with you, I decided to agree to contact that being. And since then I had just two experiences, possibly only one. I don't know if the other one would connect to it, but the first night I awoke in the middle of the night, and in like a mega-second, I knew everything. And that quick instant also, I forgot everything, but I knew everything about it. All right, you have not really forgotten it, but go on. So I don't know what happened that night, and something happened. Basically what you are saying is, because you have a loud agreement to begin to play out according to agreement, you didn't receive a burst of knowingness, a innocence, revelation. Now, never put the pressure on yourself to think that you had the brass ring in your hand and it is slipped away. Now, you have the brass ring most firmly within your grasp. However again, in one particular now moment, you had a line and integrated all these ideas simultaneously, which came as a rush of alignment. But because you are exploring timing, you now that you have flooded in so to speak, are going to play out each nuance at Iraka, so again simply live your life. And things will be obvious when it is of most service to you. For it is not always beneficial for you to understand every little detail. If you drive your automobile, if you are so much concerned about which gear, as much as which gear, which belt goes with this, which goes that you would never get out of your drive way. Simply drive. Allow the details to take care of themselves. And when you pass the appropriate road sign, it will be obvious. You have made, from our perspective, a great leap in this direction. Simply allow yourself and listen to the wording. The joy of continuing to unfold your acclimance. Alright? Was there a second as you say a current that may have been reminded? Okay, but the next thing, three nights later, I was looking forward to a stronger contact with this entity, one that I would remember. And that night, I don't know if I ever saw this, but I had so much energy in my body, my feet, and my legs felt like they were just falling off. They were feeling, so feeling you get right before you put all these things. Alright, you will acclimate to this idea, not be concerned. Okay, it happens all night, and I think I said it even out loud because of science, there's too much energy. Alright, but realize you do not create anything that you cannot handle, so it may be that you are just acclimatizing to it. If you do feel all of it suddenly that it cuts off, do not hear that you have lost that energy. Think that you have acclimated to it, just similar to, as you say, a smell that pervades your old factory sense, and as you sit in a room with it, you then begin to not smell it anymore. Very similar to the idea of acclimatizing to energy, so simply relax, or realize that what the indicator is most neutral. And that if you are, of course, label it negatively and freak out, you will get that effect. If, in a sense, you label it positively with positive truff, then you will get the out effect. Are you having a good time? Yes. I think think it was negative, I just thought maybe my body couldn't handle whatever was going on, and all night long, I just broke my legs really hard. Alright, that is very common, as you say, symptoms, and will subside as you get used to it. But you never get too much ever, ever, ever. You may create a scenario whereby you interpret it as too much. It is, by definition, not possible. Forget too much, it will not blow up. Okay, last time you told me you might be able to share with me more about the answer to my rule. Yes, and, not to be evasive, we will, at a further future timing, do so. However, you are still quite in the midst of that discovery, and I suspect you will be able to tell me what you are asking, and that is what we are asking. But we are not here to do anything for you. Simply remind you quite strongly that you can do it yourself, and you can, and you have. Okay, thank you. Another question not related. I was listening to a dissent by Linda Kuber's law, and she was talking about information she got from the people of the ladies. And she was saying that there three and a half years ago she got the information that there was only ten years left clean water on our planet unless something would be done. And she wasn't sure how much we had started to be supreme apart. Now, realize again, all truths are true. And for that individual, she may very well be on such a world. However, our perception now is that that was a filtered communication. You understand? Do you follow me? In other words, not as directly pure as transmitted. Very often, ideas of this nature will come across to motivate individuals in your society, but the interpretation of them may be somewhat inaccurate. That is not our sensing. Our sensing is that you are moving positively, not negatively. Now, which do you prefer? Realizing both us will exist, we suggest if you are prone to thirst, being on the one with the good water. I really feel that the earth is getting better. Very good. And what I don't understand, what I'm thinking, and then the least is being contrary to my belief of what it has. Very often in your society, you have experienced what you label trials by fire. A common and very strong mass consciousness belief system within your society. Is that in order to build up a new, you've got to shave down and break up the old. That is one way to do it. And much of the turmoil that you do perceive is that aspect. However, do not be mistaken. Nothing is etched in stone. It can still go either way. Act as you wish it to go. And that will be the world that you are on, for there will be an earth where that does become a war. There will be another earth where that does not become a war. There will be an earth in the middle where it sort of becomes a war. Do you understand the idea? I understand what you're saying, but it's just so right to your grasp. That's all right. You are actually grasping it quite well. Simply sometimes in order to grasp, you need to loosen up your grip of it. So widen up and realize that you get what you prefer. Just don't let any outer quote evidence convince you otherwise. You can label anything any way. You can take any circumstance and make it a better circumstance. For instance, your middle east situation, one may say, this is very bad. We are very close to a war. Another may say, look at the unprecedented unity upon our planet between nations to not condone the activities of such an individual that only 40 to 50 of your years ago, that scenario was able to play itself out. So we see much progress. Do not quote get hooked on the result. One other idea. There is an extinction between the idea of expectations and expectancy. Expectations are your idea that something will occur in a particular way. Expectancy is some idea that things will occur, period, without walking it into how it must occur. Therefore shift your perspective slightly so that you have expected. See and not expectation. That very simple shift shall we say will get rid of, in a sense, all the disappointment you create. For if you don't expect things to happen in a certain way, and you are just simply having an expectancy for them to go in a certain direction, you don't walk in how it has to happen. You give it more leeway to play out. Does that help? Can we delve further along these lines? A long line of privacy on all kinds of things I just knew. I asked you, the last time I was here, you were here, you were here. I was about a cost I had for special years, and had to do the psychic interference and a woman myself in a prior life. And you told me to talk to them. I have a very good imagination, but it was difficult for me to think of what's changed her. If she died violently. One moment. Partly you understood our intention. The idea was not to talk to her, but to talk to that entity, which you have done. How is your cost? I still have it. All right. Simply again, do not get booked on the results. When you open up communications in general allowing them to come out in a flowing manner, you will not have to cough them up. This one had a pouring brush, a filing half-time. And it all kind of is happening simultaneously. Is that always going to go on? You're innocent. It will only include you when you choose to pipe into it. However, and you never have to again. It's up to you. So innocent is open. In a sense, yes. Within this set of circumstance, within this exploration of this life, you are creating it all from now anyway, and then giving it varying significance. It is what we have said at the beginning of this interaction. You create the path from the present. You don't send your memory back and relive a path. You recreate it now in the present. Therefore, it's effect on you. It's only determined by how you are willing to allow it to affect you. It has no experiential causal effect on you now, other than your interpretation of it when then looking back to it. And you literally recreate your path and your future when you change your presence. Because in order to be an individual with this present, you have to have slightly different things occurring in your path to make that allowance. And needless to say, if you change in the present, that then changes your future. You understand? So when you get to talk to the entity, simply by allowing that interaction to play out, you may find a cessation of that ideal you label the cost, not withholding communications that you have made agreements to have. These are not unpleasant agreements that are made against your will between life guides now. These are joyous agreements with a particular purpose. May it possibly be one of the greatest reasons for incarnating within this existence at this time. Not that it is necessarily just one, but by moving on with it, then allowing yourself to flow. You don't block things up and then have to cough them out. Sounds that out? Thank you very much for your willingness to delve until you are satisfied. Four-hour information is only as good as your willingness to glean it. Thank you very much. Shady! Yes, I have another question for you that came to my mind as we're talking. Oh, right. I sometimes hear a tone, it's like what I call frequency tone, in my ears, and not all the time, but sometimes when I'm... So does the physiological channel before you, proceed? I'm not sure what it all means. It feels like it just gets loud and then it'll just go very low and disappear. I think it's a sending of a message, I don't understand. Thank you very much. Realize that it's nothing that you are not understanding that is occurring unless you created that way. Simply that, there are vibrations which comprise reality. Reality, very in a real sense, is the manifestation of difference in vibration. That is what determines one object from another. One situation from another, one position in space from another, one position in time from another. There are, on what you might label, loosely speaking, primal tones that are inherently present within the universe, the multi-verse. And from time to time, for very reason, individuals will have into those tones. Simply, if it has a relative significance for you, it will be obvious. If not, enjoy the song. Isn't as you say, annoying? No. All right. I'm very excited to always try to stretch this to what it was, and I can come back to it for a moment when I didn't expect it to happen. We may suggest that your most loving conscious recognition, that that is part of everything and not extraneous, would be next time you hear it, have a long. Then you will be synchronizing to a primal tone of existence, and may find if you have physical elements, they mysteriously disappear. For this is an aligning process, and aligning with an align bio-energetic field cannot contain the ideal you have labeled this ease. All right. Okay. At this time, we shall take a short break. We will resume contact in this fashion in 10 to 15 of your old minutes.
