 That does explain me that whole thing, how I came about it. You know, I actually got to the point of do not my intention of doing anything like this. But before I actually begin, what I was wondering is if anybody had any questions for me personally, I'm glad to entertain them prior to challenging. And it's okay if you don't. All right, so I had to make that available anyway. The only one thing that I do ask is I'm going into this slightly altered state that I go into. And when I'm coming out, both now at the break and at the end that you just kind of maintain a little bit of quiet. I get very diffused and can get very distracted. All of a sudden there's a lot of noise when I sort of come back. I don't retain anything that's actually occurring until afterward I then listen to the tape to hear it. Enough of me is, I guess, pushed aside to allow him to come through. I think what happens is that bypass is a lot of my belief systems, although many of them are in agreement with this and becoming more so all the time. I guess it gets there, still won't totally have it down. What we were kind of made aware of in the last interaction, however, was that as I do integrate and incorporate this into my own life, that there's more of a chance that I won't have to be into such a deep state myself. And then I can actually participate on a different level which I'm looking forward to. So I'll be doing what excites me and living the philosophies that he speaks about. The other thing I might say is that the degree that you're willing to ask a question is a degree to which you'll answer it. If you're very general, you'll usually get a general answer. If you're very specific, you stand the best chance of getting a specific answer. I say stand the best chance because the one thing that he won't do is take away anybody's discovery. Anything that they might have a great joy in actually discovering himself, he'll give you some information, he'll usually say something fairly sufficient, but he won't come out and hand it to you because that's part of your exploration. And his whole message basically is self-empowerment, but he comes through with an amazing amount of information, so he can pretty much ask him whatever he wants. And also, he does tend to reflect back the energy of the group, so if you have a good time, you'll see he can have a good time. Lastly, he's a bit loud, so you may just be prepared when he comes out. He doesn't sound exactly like I do. And he'll get used to it. It's kind of a small row with a lot of people, so just wanted to prepare you for that. It takes me just a few minutes and you can just sort of keep yourself busy for a couple seconds. I appreciate it. Lastly, thank you for coming and enjoy yourself. Oh, go ahead. Should we ask personal questions or... If you would like, if you're comfortable asking in a crowd, he'll answer them. Very often what will happen, you'll find it's rather remarkable. If you don't ask a question that you have, it tends to get answered anyway. There tends to be enough of a unity in the room where he'll cover it at some point. And I never know what to expect from him, so you know, that never means to be seen, but he does have a tendency to pretty much get what most people want to hear. He reads the energy pretty well, which is interesting being that prior to doing this, I have no psychic background, at least that I know of. But he seems to display a high degree of psychic ability in terms of being able to tune into people and tune into where they're going and so forth. So, again, whatever you're comfortable doing, he's comfortable doing. He is not, I'll tell you one thing, he is not shy. So, have a good time. Is there any other questions before I say? Okay, again, thanks for coming. I'll see you at the break or however he goes with it. Thank you. Okay.
