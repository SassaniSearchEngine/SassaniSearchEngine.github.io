 Oh, I don't think before we continue sharing, allow me to say the following. You have an expression in your vernacular. Say the first thing that comes to your life. Perhaps when beginnings you re-align your approach in your reality toward positive expression of yourself and positive experience of your life. Perhaps you just may wish to put that on hold. You understand the following in terms of what you refer to as relationship, interpersonal relationship. Until your life is a living expression of your positive intention and positive expression. Say the first thing that comes to your mind may just be slightly counterproductive. This is not to discourage the idea of spontaneity. This is not to discourage the idea of spontaneous expression. Once indeed your approach is in alignment with your desires, preferences, and self knowledge, then that very same trait, that very same approach will have quite a positive response and allow people to see in no uncertain terms that you know who you are and you mean what you say. And you are again a spontaneous emission in progress, by all means. But while you are realigning, did you decide there is any need to do so? Say the first thing that comes to your mind will often be a reactive response according to A, so I say slightly less constructive belief than your most empowered belief in any given situation. So, gauging your response in interpersonal relationships to simply have it expressed in the simplest term possible, may be again inserting a pawn before you respond. Should you find that your tendency in any given situation is to respond in a negative way? For needless to say, even your own observation in that sense will support what I am saying, that when you have a spontaneously negative emission in an interpersonal interaction, you invariably create a negative response from the other individual. And often you will even say, I did not mean to say that, but your actions, your response, which is in this case your words, did speak louder, you did say that and in that moment at least, that is who you were. That response creates an effect and in what you call relationship situation, it tends to be somewhat immediate and complete. Or your relationship, what you call your close interpersonal relationship, will very closely mirror your response very spontaneously and immediately. So, too simply, realign before you speak, particularly if your perception and your interpretation of what is being said to you is negative, is what allows you to stop as you say hitting the negative ball back into the other course. I understand that maybe this sounds too simple to be true, maybe it sounds as though you are squelching in a given moment where you are. But this is only if who you are is ever fluctuating between conscious and automatic, between constructive and destructive. And when you put out something that is destructive, that is negative, that is negatively reactive, you will see it mirror back to you in your reality. And therefore, the statement still stands that you control your response which seems to control your perception of your reality. This goes for any relationship. If someone says something to you that you feel is most negative, that is their approach. If you decide who you are and you accept who you are, and part of that definition is that you wish a positive experience, if your output is positive no matter what, you will, to use again your own flying, just use any given situation. So only can the idea of argument, negative interaction, perpetuate if both or as many individuals that are involved continue to perpetuate their expression. And therefore you can always immediately see the effect of engaging your response in interpersonal relationships. You will understand that when you last out, you are not functioning from a position of being comfortable with who you are. You are not functioning from a position of putting out a constructive reflection. And therefore what you do put out is what you will seem to get back. And in fact, in that moment, if you put out negativity, you are being the vibration of negativity. And regardless of what the other person says, even if it would seem initially to not be negative, you may still interpret it in negative terms because your response also again will determine your propensity to interpret a situation in a specific way. So if your usual approach is to respond negatively, your interpretation will be negative. If you shift that response, regardless of your initial interpretation, to be a positive response, you begin to transform what you call the tendency, but what is actually a perpetuated choice of interpreting what another person is saying. Your circumstance, your surroundings in negative terms. And that is what allows you to pivot to transform again seemingly instantaneously, which you always do anyway. So perhaps this may just be one example of where holding your tongue may be most constructed, but not for too long. For once you realize there will always be a positive response. And once you have pause to give yourself the opportunity to present to yourself that positive option, it will simply be compelling for you to express to choose that option because it is truly more representative of who you say you desire to be. And often the automatic response is simply not giving yourself the benefit of one single positive other option. Therefore, pausing before you ask, pausing before you say anything is very key to consciously realigning and creating anew rather than perpetuating, which is still creating anew. But the old negative reality. So therefore, there was, perhaps you can say on my end, a sense thing that it would be beneficial to address this as well. Perhaps it does not apply to any of you. If so, I apologize. Only kidding. Love means never having to say that. Proceed, duke, number two. I don't think you were the duke. Who is? I'll take it. Greetings, duke. All right. Apparently you were the new duke group protein. All right. Well, whoever duke that I'm speaking now, it's all that matters. All right. It's funny because my actually my question was, I had something to do with what you just said and it was about the idea of response. And I want to be a little more clear on this. Oh, why not? When I'm holding, let's say I get a bill in the mail. Okay. I have a mental response that happened very, very quick. All right, my doc, to simply file this into the categories we are discussing. You open an envelope. You perceive something. Perhaps in this case, a bill. You then have an interpretation, which is what you are referring to as your response, but to simply allow this to be very clear, call it your interpretation. Your response is the thing you then do after you accept or interpret what that perception means to you. Now you can automatically response and say any explicit that comes to your mind, which is perhaps a negative response. Or you can look at it more carefully, more creatively and say, all right, all right, I understand on the surface, this seems negative. I understand that everyone knows this is negative, but I'm a positive being. And therefore, even though there is the transparency that this is inherently negative, I know it is truly a neutral symbol. And I know that what I assign, as opposed to the initial interpretation, what I assign is the only thing you can do. It is the only thing that determines the effect. It is not the piece of paper with writing on it that gives the effect. It is my interpretation and then proceeding to assign meaning to that interpretation. If you allow yourself the possibility to re-align to who you are, which I assume includes the idea of being positively abundant, before you respond, before you curse the universe, then you are now doing something different. You are having what may seem to be a repetitive symbol, but the only reason that it seems to repeat is you always have a similar response when you finally express something, not just interpreted on the face, but then make an expression, or then express yourself. So what is key using that example is to simply pause before you respond. If someone else is around, do not say anything to them. Re-align to who you are. A person who is abundant and knows it and cannot pay the bill has a markedly different response than a person who feels that they are not abundant and the bill is simply a reinforcement of that idea. And it is that response which again seems, the appearances, the gradients, it seems to create the effect. So by not having a similar or same response to a similar or same seeming symbol, you change the momentum and literally change the significance of the very bill you are discussing. Okay, I'm glad I asked that. May I assume by that response that you do not understand or feel that what I am saying actually works. No, it's perfect what you said. No, I understand that it may seem. All right. On the surface, that receiving the bill that you feel that you cannot pay, causing a moment, realigning to who you are and having a positive response cannot possibly pay that bill. And that particular action in and of itself may not pay the bill, but it sets up a new series of results that may or may not directly have something to do with the bill, and it also sets up a new approach that will pay the bill. Okay, I understand what you're saying. I really do. But why agree? I just am interested in the mental response because only from my own experience, if I see an envelope and I see that little thing out there on the left hand side that says anybody that uses this, you know, gets buying $300 or imprisonment, I know it's from the IRS. Right, you know that thing? I'm really thinking that. On those people inside of me. On those people. And I haven't forebosed, I haven't verbally said anything. Or really even created the thought. I just had this immediate response of fear. That is why we drew the distinction that you perceive, you interpret, and those things in and of themselves do not seemingly create any result. It is the next step that creates the results in your life. And it is all right to have that reaction. That reaction that initial interpretation is reflective of the action that you have performed up until now. And that is why your willingness to change the response, change the action no matter what the corner of the envelope says, sets up a new template, sets up a new series of events. Set up a physical reality whereby suddenly and from some direction often unexpected, you can next time pay it. And I understand that all of these things seem removed. But when you begin to perform the positive response continuously, you will begin to pick up a similar envelope. It is never the same envelope. And not have that initial interpretation. It is the tendency to act in a very similar manner each time you get the envelope that creates the propensity to interpret it in that way. So, perpetuation. And that is why doing something different, not hollowly, not on the surface, not to try to trick the universe. But because you refuse to be anything less than who you are in every situation is a completely different approach with a completely different result that then changes or transforms your tendency to continue to interpret your reality in those negative terms. And so again to address this very specifically, you need not judge yourself or measure yourself against the standard that if you have the ability to do it, that if you have that initial interpretation, you have failed. Or you are not living your joy or path. And your acknowledgement that it is all right to have had that interpretation. You have always acted in a particular way in a similar circumstance and the interpretation is completely logical. Let yourself have it but not settle for it. Not allow it to be a symbol to define yourself. Not allow it to be a symbol to decide, well I thought I was so expanded, this envelope tells me I'm not. And therefore the decision is I'm not. The trust is I'm not and the actions cannot be anything but a direct reflection of the fact that you now decide you're not. And see, here's the proof. Right. Changing the actions will change your tendency to interpret it in that way. We love your response. No, but I have, when I get just to be exact about that, I'm clear on what you said. And I was really interested in that in the other response that I used to have. Now I'm going to have a different response. Before I used to look at it and say, oh, you know, what was me? And then after about maybe 30 seconds I would say, wow, this is a symbol of, you know, I'm abundant. Oh yeah, I'm abundant. The way that you are saying that, feel expressive, that you are humoring yourself. I know that. And that is vastly different from simply deciding because you know that is who you are and trusting. Yeah, well, you're, that's something, this is really great and it's very significant because I have been getting tired of saying, oh yeah, I'm abundant. I didn't believe it, you know. I wasn't believing myself and I was really frustrated with that because this is really perfect. Oh, perhaps my response would be a more constructive approach would be to pick up the envelope. Allow yourself, welcome yourself to have any interpretation that you initially seem to have automatically. You're going to anyway, embrace it, invite it. Then before you do anything, ask yourself who you desire to be. Not, oh yeah, I'm abundant. And in parentheses, but here's the symbol that tells me this is all bold. Simply redefining, redesigning, all right, all right. Here is the symbol, I am definitely interpreting it as a reinforcement that I am not abundant. I acknowledge and I allow it, but I do not allow myself to continue to assign that meaning because this is the only control I have to not again taunt the universe, but assign who you are. All right, I have this. It is an expression of who I am to be able to pay these as they come in or better yet before they come in. Align up with who you are with what's available. It can be a reflection that you are failing or it can be a reminder that this is not what you wish to continue to create. It is all in the interpretation, the sarcastic response is not fully committing to the positive decision. And it is still incorporating some of the atmosphere of prove it to the universe. You keep giving me evidence that none of this works. Yeah, I'm abundant. Yeah, sure. That's the thing. All joking aside, I really have responded that I am abundant and yet I still have to go to a place where I must not be believing myself. Perhaps again, as we have discussed through some degree, your approach, though constructed, has not been consistent. And again, to use the terminology, from time to time in a fairly regular manner, UK. What caves me? You simply say, all right, the evidence is too overwhelming. I buy into the decision using the evidence rather than perpetuating the decision of who I am continuously for again even three days of your time. Why would I personally choose to do this so much? Excellent question. Why would you? I've asked myself that. All right. You know, this moment is anew. Why now do you do that? To discover this magnificent abundance that I am, period. That's what I imagine it to be. I can feel that, too. Yet it's still questionable to me of why I really, really need so many hurdles in my life to really believe something. Like the... Do you feel in the process of this question that your response is 100% consistently positive? I feel like asking the crowd. That's who I am. I think, well, what do I sound like? Because I hear something different than maybe what everybody else hears. So is that... It is my perception with no judgment whatsoever attached that your response, all for me. I am not saying this to criticize or judge you. Simply an observation. To make matters more interesting you sometimes deny that. But there is nothing wrong with that either. Simply understanding, I wish to be consistent. I will be consistent is all it takes to change it all. Then I will be consistent. Are you consistent now? Yes. Are you in the field? I am consistent. All right. That's all I need, right? Often individuals will test their decision. When you consistently have the positive response, you will no longer seem to test your decision. The indicator that your response is not consistently positive, need not be, well, everyone, what do you think? But can simply be that indicator? Okay. Does that make sense? No, perfect sense. All right. This is really amazing. This has been a great gift for me. It is a rule rather than the exception, but I understand what you mean. That's great. May I ask you one other question? And feel free again to be honest or not. I'm happy to say it. Up to you. Yes, you may. I will never force you to know more of yourself. No. I want to know. Now I ask you this, and it is up to you to answer in any way you wish I will take your words at their value no matter what I tend. All right. Do you find yourself from time to time judging yourself? Yes or no? Yes. All right. That also is an indicator that your response is not consistently positive. And you need not judge yourself for having a not consistently positive response. You can transform this all right now by using that fact and understanding while you're judging yourself, chances are the next thing you do won't necessarily be very positive. And in finding that you are judging yourself, the approach that assists you to transform it to simply say again, all right, all right, all right, I'm judging myself. But I do not wish to continue to do so. I understand I have done something that apparently is not constructed and judging myself for that and then acting from the atmosphere of that judgment. But I can simply observe that I have done that, see that it has not gotten the positive result, not do that again and actually thank that very same action for allowing me to realign rather than judging myself. But when you judge yourself for judging, you compound it and simply saying, all right, all right, all right, I judge myself. I have the option to love myself unconditionally, to love myself conditionally, to love myself not at all, which looks most attractive. Realignment. I understand that. Hopefully not, no, trust me, we will never talk about this ever again because right now I'm a major decision that I no longer, when I do judge myself, if I do, see? You can't use it all. And what can occur is that we can talk about it again when you are giving your testimonials from the positive. It is all right to judge yourself. Judgment can be something that lasts, but a fraction of a moment. Joining yourself that you love yourself no matter what can also be a fraction of a moment. All the indicators are there. All the interpretations may seem automatic initially, but it is the response which will create an effect which will transform at all. Different response will create different interpretations and you will no longer judge that particular approach when you begin to walk in step with who you know yourself to be. And if you crave big deals, don't harp upon it unless you wish to carry around and perpetuate the results of the judgment. I understood. All right. Thank you very much. Sound a bit more excited about it. I'm very excited to get the tape and really listen to it. Oh, the tape, because I am sitting here and I still, my head just buzzing. Perhaps again, this is a bit too simple, but this is the level at which we choose to communicate. Consolidation, simplification. Again, as I have said, decision, trust and action are really one thing. And for now, specifically, say, focus. Your action is the expression of your decision and your trust in any given moment. And that is what you can control. That is what you have the choice to express in any way, in any moment, no matter what. Wow. Yes. Thank you. All right. Matthew, one quick question. No, that was beyond that. And not an out-or-go-act question. He will anyway. Real quick, there's lots of things to talk about, obviously. But I went on the trip out to Sedona. And there was a lot of interesting things that happened, of course. One dream pops in my mind, though, that I had while I was at this place called Armasanti, which is out in the middle of nowhere, basically. And I was dreaming that there was a fire in the place, in the building. And there was a lot of smoke. And then all of a sudden, the spaceship lands, and Andrew's there. And Andrew said, wait, don't leave without me. So all of a sudden, he beams up and disappears. And then I go up and find out that there's no fires. There's just a bunch of smoke. Now I don't know why I was thinking of him. I don't know where this came from. But it was a bit interesting to me and perhaps the channel. So I would like to know your interpretation of it. Simply that when you are willing to dig deeper and open your eyes wider, you will find that many of the negative interpretations that you assign are simply inaccurate. There is no fire. What about the faith trap that Andrew is? If he, I took the interpretation, he was sharing that idea with me, that fire is transformation to me, and that there's the lack of an honor with that. It was your negative interpretation that created the reaction that you have shared with me, and that we are in many ways discussing right now. The symbol, again, loosely speaking of what you refer to as the spaceship, simply can represent, in this instance, the removal of your power from yourself, the assumption that you do not contain at all. And that there is an external power through which you can gain your power. But the fire, the smoke, the house, Andrew, the craft are all new. I thank you. Thank you very much. Shirdi. Female. Alon, me? Which one? It's your world. Alon, I had something to just share about what I interpreted after perceived as an interpret and then pause and then respond. My pause comes in a listening, and it's just another word for pause, I think, because I like to listen, I've been experiencing a lot with listening lately and noticing that when I want to immediately respond in a negative way or in an unconscious way, I decide instead to listen to what's deeper or what I heard with my true self-ears, with my heart, with my grounded conscious being. And what do you find to be the effect of this approach? Well, very positively, the person or the message coming, incoming message feels value because I'm actually listening to that person and feeling the impact of their words or their input. And then when you find in any given situation that when you are willing to listen in such a way, that you are very effortlessly able to reinterpret what they are saying according to your positive approach. Absolutely. So, yes. You mean to tell me? It's not that accurate. Oh, yes. And I'm really curious about why my ears are having so much itchy sensation all the time lately and has thought about it's just reminding me to keep the listening going on. And do you have any more input on your thing? You have nailed it down rather well. And simply your willingness to continue to listen will allow you to hear more of yourself, not necessarily the other individual. Your other individuals are simply reflections, your versions of them that will always be completely appropriate to reinforce whatever you are exploring. And therefore again, you're willing that to consciously continue to listen will in that sense transform any physical reminders to do so. Have you not found that this has begun to cease already? Yes. Oh, right. I had lots of dreams of water being lately. And I wondered if you have any information of dream from dreamer and from our ocean friends. And simply it is their perception that you are all doing just fine. All right. Swimmingly. But the idea is that they acknowledge your willingness and can detect on what you call a mass level, a tendency or a shift in that sense. Do not necessarily always assume what you are perceiving as water beings are what you call the dolphins upon your planet, though sometimes they are. There have been an instance or two where you have swam in your dreams with members of my own society. The other night was a horse, a green horse swimming, coming out of the ocean to visit me. And I think that's the three days thing is really valuable. But I think that we make responses from all day long and thousands of responses. And I think that is it okay to positively respond to something yet still state your progress? Say, okay, well, I'm afraid that you didn't do that. But in that zone, yeah, well, in a positive way, but still saying I prefer that you didn't do that. Absolutely. And we were not suggesting that your response should squelch things that you know are true for you to communicate. Certainly that no matter what you are, impels who communicates, there is always, always, always a positive way to express it. And perhaps part of the challenge may seem to be to use your creativity and you will in fact amaze yourself to the degree that you can express anything in empowered, positive and unconditionally loving terms. Anything. I think that's true. I mean, I've been thinking of the word responsibility a lot. And you know, I can be responsible for a lot of people at one time for their children. But there will be, and I think it's very important to know that, to know that you can respond in a certain way saying that, well, you know, that's not appropriate or whatever, but still come across in a positive way. Oh, why? I understand that it may at times seem laborious, but rather than saying that is not appropriate, particularly when you are referring to what you call children. Perhaps the more positive explanation of what is and why will serve the same purpose and keep it in the positive response vein. I think that you're right. That's true. Thank you. And another thought with being, you know, the whole response able is that you also can't be responsible for how someone interprets what you're saying. Absolutely not. And when your intention is consistently positive, your reality reflects that back to you. And it's certain individuals are unwilling to match that vibration. Your interactions with them, your relationships with them will transform. But more often, perhaps than not, you will find that when you are willing to put yourself out in that way, you invoke that aspect in another or the other person and find in general that you reach what you call agreement, not necessarily that you need to conform, but that there is a workable agreement in any situation, particularly with the people that you attract what you call most closely. Does that make sense? Yeah, it also. Thank you. All right, this one other quick clarification. The three days thing and then you said something about three weeks. Now, three days you'll notice the difference. And three days you will notice an obvious difference that will perhaps inspire you one moment. All right, three days you will notice enough compelling results to effortlessly continue and see the obvious constructive value three weeks at the onset, at the longest will provide a complete sweeping transformation visible in all aspects and relationships of your life. That's really exciting. It is and it demonstrates the small change that results in the sweeping transformation. We generally refrain from such concrete, finite designations. In this case, as an average, however, this demonstrates the short timeframe in which you can have the results that you seek when you choose to play along the gradient, whereby your actions create in the physical world results. And it is exciting. And it is the former so to speak three weeks that have resulted in whatever you are seeming to have a tendency to interpret right now. So not only will it work, so to speak, it does work, it has worked. All right. I thank you. Sherry, hey, male. I have a friend who hears a hum. She has been hearing you for about five years and there are other people who have this problem also. It is a very low frequency hum and they have been told that comes from the earth or from electromagnetic waves in general and it causes a lack of sleep, pain. Others? Do you know anything about the contaminant? The idea is simply this. Your planet as does any planet and in fact individuals and any expression of consciousness in a physical reality particularly vibrates at a certain rate. When you are synchronized to that rate, you do not notice it. When you are in that sense, not quite in sync with that particular rate, you can notice the difference. And so therefore my particular cell I say, suggestion to that and any individual who have such an experience would be the idea of creating what you call a meditative approach whereby you use that sound to synchronize yourself to that vibration. Using the presence of that sound to shift your own vibration. Using the presence of that sound and the changes that occur within it as you shift as feedback. I have actually suggested something like that to her and I thought maybe this was a transitional experience that she was having because she seems to be in a transition point, point of a great change and it all coincides together. However when I in a hip and therapy session told her to focus on the sound, it caused great pain. But the idea is not so much to focus upon it as to notice it as she shifts herself to see whether it intensifies or as you say this appears. That is her feedback to gauge her particular, perhaps you can say vibrational emanation, similar to what you call biofeedback. Change her vibrational emanation. Simply through the idea of understanding that her vibration is the result of again her decisions, trust and action and that her decision to simply align to the vibration is in and of itself enough to begin to hear a change which then allows her again the opening to continue that change. It is a subtle thing but it starts with the acceptance of the idea that her vibration is a statement of who she is and not the other way around. So it is not an alien negative, absolutely negative thing that she believes, that is probably what creates a worsening of a situation. One moment. Ah. Attaching that definition in many ways prolongs the effect. That interpretation and subsequent response perpetuates the very phenomena. It is not by the way my perception that that is the cause. And so she will utilize whatever feedback you share from me and it is up to her whether she will use that to pivot or not. Generally speaking were that the case I would be aware of it at least on some level. And so all the other people on the planet who experience this are experiencing generally the same type of phenomenon. There can be nuances that there are as many of as individuals but generally speaking there is a common answer. There are other reasons but to stick to the subject for now that will do. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Would you be willing to answer a question about implant? Perhaps. I have an eye infection and I was working with a friend of mine who is a healer the other day we exchange healing services. And when we went into the eye what we thought that we found were implants and they were a ten moment in yourself. Matter of fact I will actually say absolutely not. Not in the way you are assuming you may be implanting or super imposing ideas but there is no physical barrier. So these would be energy. The effect of let me ask you. The idea the terminology implant infers that something was put there from another source. Except that it is an idea that you are exploring an emanate from you that gives you the power back to transform. The idea in these then if calling it whatever you would want to call it they would be energy farms and they were dark and the effect of it was that it was keeping me from fully expressing myself and fully expressing my power. So in view of what you are saying another level of understanding of that in is that I created that or invited that. Perhaps you are using it as a symbol to increase your awareness and simply decide a new. Some of it was when I was three years old in this lifetime life became very difficult and maybe kind of dangerous for me so certain things happened that would prevent me from calling that much attention to myself from my parents for example. And so that was part of it that we lifted off during this session. I actually a couple of sessions and others were ones I perceive that were from other lifetimes and did have in one case had an extraterrestrial attachment to it. But I guess I am opening I really want to explore the whole idea. Oh what? Allow me to add simply one more thing. One more. Another would be at least up until this point the assumption that there was external influence and that is the key perhaps the last key to allow you to transform understanding that it is not. And not relying on that explanation interpretation decision response. But you just repeat that so it's just in my mind. The assumption that there is an implant in and of itself is perhaps the. I don't know. Perhaps for now we can't. But if something from CTO theigers, where does ause you learn you are not Trident rope in the sometimes you have to learn anything or if you didn't learn to learn what is present. Or you might say I mean to do like this and you I want to honor you for noticing you with your timeattering your number and if you do like you person do but ok. Take a few questions. Okay. You have given me many Contact Dositan curl no one gives so to Eastern surfer people and go to put that email and fail them. Just get the email family and that's haunted and you can feature them on the screen. I was. Did we read a sentence? Yes. I was. And I don't know where I stand with this belt because I think you both walked away with our own opinion. But I don't feel it's going to be solved. But I felt that I had been positive with it even though I lost my opinion too much with the service. The idea of interacting with another individual need not be to impose your point of view. But simply your responsibility is to simply, as we had discussed earlier, clearly. And perhaps if you wish to be conducive, unconditionally loving and positively expressing what the other person does with it is now out of the realm of your responsibility. And in fact, your role is if you wish to be most accurate done with. You have a perception. It is unique to you. You have attracted a situation. You are there for a reason. The reason is to simply make the communication of who you are. And if you are willing to not attach yourself to any particular result that may occur to it, you have been responsible to the individual. When you begin to insist that they change their opinion, that they dovetail their opinion to yours, that is where you have crossed the line of being responsible or, shall I say, attempting to be responsible for them. So when you communicated clearly who you were, your job was over. I don't know that I communicated it completely because I was on five-quarter. But the idea is now you are entertaining many of these ideas. You are attracting the terminology and methodology to do so now and what you call forward. Thank you. Oh my. You understand it. Thank you very much. Oh, thank you. For jumping the gun. There will be but a few more interactions. Sherry. Yvonne. Yvonne. Yvonne, I have two years ago. This isn't the way of the testimonial and the question. Oh my god. Years ago I reported difficulties that I had with the women in the community I lived with, where I was afraid of her, I was trying to avoid her. You suggested I have lunch with her. I had lunch with her. I invited her to lunch and we had lunch. And it actually transformed my relationship with her. Out of it actually came a whole new idea of which I have a business that began as a travel agency for older people. Allowing them to travel in places where they wouldn't be able to without the service. So alternating your response actually created the opposite result from what you have gotten with your original response. Yes? Yes. What's the question? I'm going to say that you have a number of 80 degrees. Well the question is the excitement to ask her out to lunch. It was not exciting at that point. To say you know you kind of have lunch with me. It was more like oh my god okay well I'll do this you know. And the excitement then opened up after having lunch with her. And then the excitement of getting the idea for the travel agency, while it was exciting. Making the calls and the inquiries wasn't so much but having made them the excitement filled. And making the further steps although not necessarily exciting as I did them the excitement keeps building. And I find more things to act on and do as this thing is the momentum continues it builds and builds. And the excitement is unfolding. But in the initial actions that I took there's not necessarily the excitement that preceded them. And often times in the language I tried to articulate you know follow your excitement. From my perspective it seems like you know do what you think will work to make a difference. And the excitement will fill you up. That is shall I say another approach but it does not negate that if indeed you do follow your excitement from moment to moment to moment that the same thing will not occur and perhaps often far more effortlessly and serendipitately. But I had never suggested that by doing certain things according to obligations that you would not create any opportunities for a type it is simply another way to go about it. Perhaps I might point out when you mention that you were not excited to have lunch with her. What was the emotion that you experienced? And bias. The flip side of excitement. Excitement with the negative interpretation. So even so there is still that under stream of excitement and the idea that you now have the ability to interpret it. To observe, to explore whether or not that feeling is simply you telling yourself this is absolutely not me or this feeling is saying well I would like to do this but I am frightened of the result. It is a fine line and an excellent distinction to be made in many of the discussions that we have had. I thank you for bringing it up but do you understand what I am saying and does that shit? Yes, but well I am going to listen to the taste of it. I think I was blanking out there from all over the world. They ask you another question. Alright. You mentioned that you were not excited to make the calls and the contacts, yes? Yes. What did you feel? There was anxiety. Oh, definitely. So I understand that the excitement was there with the fear of co-mingles and I can accept that there was excitement. Perhaps it is when you feel absolutely nothing that you can understand that it is not representative of who you are. But if you are willing to look at your anxiety and try on samples of positive interpretation and see how that feels, you can often show yourself that it is excitement. Okay. The other half-spectives I guess, or testimonial parts is that in some of these other projects that have been exciting for me, like the R-Earth project that I think I've bought this up to you connecting kids with the environment, where I've been able to and have been taking more consistent actions to make contacts where I can take action where I can. It seems to be unfolding and spreading and building up momentum very quickly. Oh, so I would put that in as like it does work. When you acted upon the idea that you were interpreting yourself as having an anxiety reaction to, and then a result was achieved, you then began to trust your excitement and feel it as a kind. But were used to say to me, I had no emotion, no charge, then I would have questioned you further as to whether you really had those results. So again, this is the issue of the interpretation of that vibration in negative terms, anxiety, positive terms, excitement. Yeah, there was a charge there, for sure. It was not a blank. Oh, I thank you. Good night. Hi, Lon. Andrew, you, Green Day. I'm going to hear you again. Andrew as well. I've gotten involved with the emergency medical system, and I'm working in an ambulance, and I'm really dealing with what you were just discussing. I'm very excited about it, but I have a lot of anxiety. Even though I think about it and understand all the reasons that I shouldn't have anxiety, I still do. Perhaps in your situation, part of the anxiety that you are creating, aside from being the flip side of excitement, also relates to your compassion. But perhaps not necessarily assigning the full power to the individual that you assign to yourself. In other words, assuming them to be the victim, so to speak, do you understand what I am saying? Your willingness to grant them the power to create the circumstances that you witnessed, understanding that it is perhaps slightly a negative expression can be the hidden. I have thought of that. All right. Have you done? Yeah, I have. When we've lost the patient, I haven't felt bad about it. I felt that it was how they wanted it to be, and we co-created it. All right. And what are other instances in which you, in that sense, create that anxiety? Well, when I was in the anxiety, I always have this terrible feeling of anxiety. I just don't like the way it feels. Do you anticipate that you will be paid in suffering? That doesn't bother me. Oh, it's interesting. It might bother me. What? What? What? That's not what it means to us. All right. Define what you feel you are anxious about. Do you feel that no matter what occurs, you will be in service? Yes, I do. Are you sure? Well, I must not be sure. I would be anxious. Not necessarily. Describe the feeling of anxiety more precisely. It's painful. It's just a... Allow me to refrain. What do you feel you are anxious about? Maybe I'm afraid I won't be adequate for the situation. To some degree? It's certainly just in possibility. Not real. It is my perception that no matter what, you will respond accordingly and appropriate. Are you willing to grant yourself the same respect? Yes. There goes the anxiety. Well, I know I've set these things to myself, and I still get to say anxiety. Oh, again. Do understand that you are passionate about what you are doing. You are excited about what you are doing. And you can simply know how you feel and remind yourself. Align yourself to why you are there, what you are doing. And that you would not have attracted the situation, nor would any other individuals that attract you, unless you were absolutely the perfect reflection in that situation. And that may, as you say, alleviate some of the self-created pressure. Yeah. Play with it. Well, I thought everything you said tonight is an helpful. Oh, thank you. Thank yourself. When I say thank you, I mean it. Thank you. All right? Male. All right? All right? Other men. Align, it seems that fundamental to truly believing that you can create your own reality is to accept and believe that you are really here by choice. I would concur. Amongst many, there is a desire to ascend, which is actually to move in their definition from a physical reality to a non-physical, more-expanded reality. And as we have shared often, as an escape, not completely accepting their choice, but there are other individuals who simply are in that sense ready. There is a distinction, though often individuals who insist they are ready are still displaying or expressing an escape hatch. Precisely. And it's an actual denial or a validation of the choice to be here. It seems to me that what we really want, and I'm speaking for myself, what I really want is to expand at a rate which allows me to continually experience the joy of discovering and expanding reality within a linear model, which is what I've chosen. Until I've reached the point where I'm ready to experience different models simultaneously, because at that point, I need that to continue to be interested and to continue to experience joy in the discovery of something new. All right. Do you recall us discussing with you the mechanism for determining which is which? Please repeat. Close your eyes. Simply say, with all conviction, it is time for me to ascend or to transform to my next level of conscious expression. Have you done so? Have you said that? Well, I thought about it. All right. You should hear me. Now open your eyes. Are you still here? Yes, but you're all different. Congratulations. Thank you. But do understand that it's that simple. If it is time, it will be spontaneous and effortless. If you open your eyes and it's still there, you can interpret there are other things that you have chosen to do. I do understand that. And I understand that those that want to ascend are, they're stating that absolutely they do not believe that this can work. And they are so certain about that that they want totally out of this reality. And from my point of view, I see as their life experience that this in fact is not working for them from their point of view. Because I see the conflict and I see the turmoil in their lives. All right. And your point. My point is at some point it would be, you know, all my point is the question, when would now be a good time to decide that you chose to be here? And then having made that choice to find who it is you choose to be, what it is you choose to experience, and act accordingly. Refraid the question. It was a statement. Oh, what? I agree. I agree. You get the question. Is that all? And is all. You are correct, sir. That is all. Simply the realization and decision to consciously take your ability to respond and use it. There is gold in them their heels. You will understand what I am saying. Male. You are. Hey, finally. Zuka number two. I'm ready. All right. For some time, I've been dying to bring up a certain subject with you. No, I've been living. Oh, thanks. Talk to you about time. You know me well enough that you would not have gotten away with that. Yeah. So, all right. But I must say, I regret there will not be enough time to discuss this. Good night. Prokey. Time. So often you remind us that we create time to exist. And I need all the help you can give me to understand what is the other choice. What's the alternative on E do you have no time? We have what you would call a more loosely defined relationship with time. We still create the idea of a series of events, but they do not necessarily occur in the way that you perceive them in your relationship. Not necessarily do they always go in a straight line. Not always does what you call the flow of time necessarily play out in a consistent term. That's the gradient idea. We we have the. We in that sense do not so much express it in a gradient as I have been discussing with you as we do express it as a choice, a method, a style of consciousness creation. This thing happen in parallel rather than in a linear sequence in the song. Often yes. Sometimes they can occur in what you would refer to it for Steve as backward time, but I will not go into that. But your children mature grow up eventually pass out of their physical form and that's the passage of time. That would be your observation. Again, there are things that I have not gotten into about our perception of time because they would simply be confusing. And simply in that sense, perhaps you can say not translate very well. But basically speaking, that is our loose association of time in that we can create it in the way that you are accustomed to. That is an option that is perhaps you can say not completely accurately, but a mainstream approach. We do have the idea of what you call parallelism. Whereby for instance, just to use one simple example, you create yourselves and it's very finite discrete relationship to time. Where your parent see is that you can focus on one thing at a time. If there are two sounds occurring, you generally focus in on one and the other is in the background, not really relevant. You know it's there, but you are not getting information from it. Your attention is on one. You choose, you then focus your attention, pinpoint one idea. Same thing with what you call sight. For instance, your physical eye. If you have something in the foreground, something in the background, rather than perceiving them both and drawing relevant parallel information from both, you focus on one seemingly at the cost of the other. So if you focus on something in the foreground, what you call the background becomes blurry or irrelevant. If you focus on the background, the opposite occurs. What is in the foreground seems to be blurry or irrelevant. We can focus on both, not only with our physical senses, but also with our consciousness. And can therefore think in what you might refer to as parallel terms, where we can have several many lines of thought going on simultaneously, which in many ways and one way to look at it, create chords or harmonics of thought. But again, this does get complicated in the way that your approach of one thing at a time, with everything else being irrelevant until you shift your focus, is so much different from the idea of this parallelism that it doesn't translate completely. And if you would imagine being able to see something in the foreground and in the background, simultaneously deriving equal amounts of usable information for both, simultaneously making decisions about both, simultaneously responding to both. This begins to illustrate some of the difference in our approach. When we interact with you through a physical channel, we use your approach to communicate with you in the way that you are accustomed. But from my end, I have a parallel interpretation, if I wish, I do have the ability, by the way, to focus on one thing at a time, but I have a parallel interpretation of what's going on. So you may think, I'm speaking to you, I'm speaking to this one, I'm speaking to that one, I may perceive all the conversations going on at the same time, making perfect sense to me on all levels. And that is the slightly different, perhaps from your point of view, expanded, but simply more, not qualitatively different, simply more quantitatively, of our particular approach. This is in a sense one of the things that allows us to have a telepathic society. For if everyone is in touch, there must be some method to interpret all of these impulses of consciousness. And our approach allows us to do so. You have 250 million people, approximately, on Epsis-Soney, are you telling me you can be aware of what's going on with each one on Epsis-Soney? Some degree, though, generally, there will be some that will appear in the background, irrelevant. We will only focus on what is relevant to what we are exploring, similar to yourself. In this sense, can you live more than one life at a time? Already on. But my apparently, from my point of view, in my physical life right now, is that this is the only life. Well, if there's any ideas that all realities exist simultaneously, do that? We are able to, perhaps you can say, process and make sense of more of them simultaneously than you. But this is only because of your choice. You can shift it. Again, we generally refrain from going into this because it gets confusing. But it allows you to get an idea of what is available. It allows you to get an idea of another option of style of consciousness expression. And so we accept the timing of your question to express to you aspects of our consciousness that we have not necessarily discussed before. And I thank you. As your capability as you're describing characteristic of force density? It is an option available, a style available in force density. What you refer to as force density, a more expanded expression of consciousness, again, not any better, simply different, has a plethora of options. Ours is but one. Technically, again, to not confuse you, I know this word throws monkey wrench in work, an infinite number. But let's keep it concrete. Don't wonder I get confused when I try to imagine, well, we create time to exist. And what are you telling us you've got this difference and you've been very helpful. I appreciate that. I got one last question here. And that is, have I already lived my life somehow or other? And now I'm doing it again? Well, that is one way to look at it. But you are stating it from a linear one at a time point of view. From another point of view, you're living all these lives simultaneously, parallel. From another point of view, everything simultaneously exists right now. And you can see how when we expand these explanations, they simply make confusing. I want to pick the one where I'm having the voice. Perhaps, only a suggestion. You might simply assume that is where you are sitting right now. And that is why you are sitting there. Hold on. I thank you. At this time, allow me to thank you all for allowing us to bring these interactions to a new level. We have always called them interaction because it is the action that speaks aloud so to speak. We do not insist that you do anything that we ever share. We simply trust that the timing of our sharing it with you corresponds to your timing automatically by convention, synchronicically. And therefore, you will always continue to attract whatever reflections allow you to explore whatever is relevant to you. It may seem right now, like one thing at a time, you will find that to change. I thank you and bid you a most fond and loving. Thank you.
