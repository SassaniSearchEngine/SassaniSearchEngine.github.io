 All right, I'll say continue sharing. I speak manual. Please answer this question. Perhaps, maybe. It's not, well, yes, it would be part of my life. You see twins in the future. There's one more question. Since it becomes difficult for me to distinguish between actual and metaphoric, I can only say there is a likelihood behind it. I cannot be any more deafness than that, for this can mean many things. Is there some specific reason that you were asking me? I guess my daughter's acting and possibly the doctor's not quite sure. Oh, do you desire that? Yes. Well, I thank you for at least allowing me to scan. Is there anything else you wish to share? Yes. Please, I'm very complex. Help straighten me out. Whoa. Do you judge yourself for being so complex? Do I judge myself? Yes. Why? Is there not a richness in a fullness in complexity? Well, I believe so, yes. Oh, so when you judge yourself for being complex, are you assuming that you are making things too difficult for yourself? Yes. In what way? Well, number one, in my own personal life, and number two, in my important case, I wish to make changes and I've been listening to you this evening. And as you were speaking, I was mentally saying, yes, I want to change and I want to do these things. And yes, I have been reluctant to completely surrender because they're again the monetary. I'm asking myself, do I touch myself enough to forgo my employment and to throw everything to the win so in hopes that the universe will survive what I need. Hope and flies out. Now, understand the following. What we are speaking of is not running from something that you no longer choose to be. It is walking toward what you do choose to be, which by definition will distance you from that which you no longer choose to experience. So, you need not, again, run from the job if you establish what it is you will prefer to do. Then you will lay down a foundation which, again, will automatically distance you from the, shall I say, less representative presentation of the job. What is it you would like to be doing? What is it that you see yourself doing that brings you joy, that excites you? I want to be a grandmother to the twins. Oh, what else? And I would like to leave a life of my own again. Oh, what would you wish to do to express your creativity in that life other than what you have just mentioned? Well, hopefully I would have a book published. Oh, now, since I am asking you what you wish, you need not say hopefully just tell me what it is you designed. You would like to have a book published, eh? Yes. Now, say if you wish. I would like to have the book published. Does that feel better than hopefully I will have a book published? Oh, definitely. Oh, you have that degree of choice and hopefully I will have a book published is far different from I desire to have a book published. That is what I was speaking of earlier about minor distinctions, minor changes in points of view. What is it that you would wish to write about? I have written a book and I have submitted it to the New York publisher. It is a child book. Oh, have you submitted it as you say to more than one source understanding that that is your desire to have it put out there? Yes, however, I have my understanding the procedure is you submitted to a publisher one at a time rather than having them, having the manuscript gather to more than one published. Oh, there are individuals present this evening of your time that if you will allow yourself to attract can begin to share with you some alternatives to that point of view. The idea being if you know that that is who you are, if you know through choice, through decision, that that is what you choose to contribute, then there may be other ways that you have not looked at in terms of shall I say expanding the possibility of expressing that in the way that you desire. Now, do you wish on an ongoing basis to produce such works? Are you currently now engaged in producing something else? I can mention that in that yes, I do have a lot of ideas for subsequent books on paper, but they are not completed manuscripts. Do you see yourself as a writer or do you see yourself as someone wishing to be a writer understanding the distinction? Both because at one time I was told that there were energies that were wanting to use me or come through me to write. Oh, who told you this? A gentleman in the area in the northeast in the paper chair. Do you think it would ring true with you? So it is who you desire to be? Now, you are correct in saying that you contain both perspectives. I wish to be a writer and I am a writer. Which one would you prefer to express? To be. Do you understand that a writer acts a particular way? Could you imagine that someone wishing to be a writer also acts a particular way? Would you imagine that the two ways are slightly different? Oh, why? There lies the key to getting off the fence in being the writer versus wishing to be a writer. Decide you are a writer simply because it is who you choose to be and you get the choice. Both exist within you and none has either more weight than the other. Again, unless you decide that it does. So choosing to be the writer, making the decision, right now, I am a writer. Simply from this now moment forward, each now moment successively, trust that you are a writer as opposed to trusting that you wish to be a writer. There is a complete distinction. And as you trust in your decision, as you trust that you are a writer, options will come along and in fact some which are already in place, as simple as sitting down and writing the next book. That is what a writer does. That will allow you to act as though you trust you are a writer. One who hopes to be a writer has ideas down on paper and does nothing with them. One that is a writer, right? Now, are you willing to be a writer to that degree? Yes. Happy writing? Thank you. I have done nothing. Oh, excuse me. Excuse me. A discurious question that's called. Man, please also ask you to come and help me when I think of you. Man, I just say this. I read the article in the Connecting the Linked Man to Being. And as I was reading the words, I heard you seeking the word. You may understand this. I am available. Now, I do not monitor individuals in your society. I'm too busy. But I trust when I'm moving through my reality, in my timing, which is far different than yours, my creation and experience of time is far different than yours, that a notion may occur to me and individual at this moment is requesting some feedback from me. I will instantaneously transmit that feedback, and it will fall into the timeframe of your reality. Now it will be up to you to interpret what I am saying. The individual channeling me and the process surrounding what you call the channeling allows me to come through quite purely where many of the desires and beliefs of the channel, or shall I say some less and less, do not interfere with my intention. So therefore, understand, I will have something to say, and it will be up to you to interpret it. Never will I say you should be doing something. If you hear should, it is you misinterpreting what I am saying. Never will what I say take on the characteristic of suggesting that you are doing anything wrong. You are not. It would validate what you are doing, perhaps provide an alternative, perhaps provide a suggestion, but not insisting that you take that, not insisting that any of the aspect of our relationship depends on you being anyone but yourself. And even if you choose not to be yourself, I will love you anyway. That is what unconditional love is. So again, perhaps the long-winded answer to your question is yes. Thank you. I have a very complicated question. I am going to try and make it as simple as possible. More complexity. I welcome you. Understand, no matter how complex the question, the answer is generally quite simple. And complexity again is just the richness, but the mechanism is simplicity itself. It is that simple. I decided last year to go for my passion, which is to be an actress and dancer. Congratulations. Thank you. But at the same time, I am working for a major corporation. And while I was working full time, I took every dollar I had and all of my energies and focused it into pursuing the arts. And that is really... Pursuing. Is it getting away from you? I'll focus on that. Okay. Better enough. Listen to your wording to aid yourself in realigning to preference and proceed. Okay. I went... I don't know how to do it now, but anyway, I just... Just say. Okay. I went for this this whole profession and I absolutely loved what I was doing. And then my money ran out. I was robbed twice. My boyfriend got very sick, almost died. Everything that was in my life just sort of stopped. And I felt like the universe... I had put my whole financial self on the line and took the risk. On the line. So there was an underlying assumption that there was a tightrope to be walked. Yeah. Yeah. I simply mention this because the flavor of that would come out in your decision, your trust, and your action. Okay. Now, there is the notion of deciding to be the actress whose life simply works and flows efficacy. That is also an option. And that brings different dynamics. But do proceed. Well, in the midst of all this being a financial debt, I decided to start my own business to sort of... To get out of the corporate situation so that I could have more time and flexibility and money to support the acting. And my business took off quite well and I find that I'm very excited about it, but it's literally teaching people how to be... Follow their excitement. And as I teach it, I say, well, I'm excited about doing this, but I'm not doing what I really want to be doing. So in other words, in creating this dynamic with such a tightrope, you attract other individuals, assist them, and watch that it really works through others. Oh, that's what I do. Well, I am asking you. I can get that out of it. Is that not one way to define it? Well... What truth will you require externally before you simply decide to do that thing yourself? Now again, I suggest to begin by redefining your decision. What is it exactly that you choose to be? Do you choose to be an actress at all costs? Or do you choose to be an actress? Effortlessly, effortlessly, because it is who you choose to be. There is a distinction right there to begin with. And secondly, will you require external proof that excitement really works with integrity? Or do you not already understand this to be one of the truths that exist within you? Are you asking me that as a question? I guess... I think you're right about the distinction between... I guess that my mind is always that someday I'm going to be this, and I've never said I am. Even I say to people, yes, I'm a dancer and an actress, but I haven't had the time or the energy to dance or act because I've been pursuing this other business, which is going well. Do I stop doing the other business and just totally focus? Well, not necessarily for your excitement may take many forward, but the idea is not so much telling others you are an actress, but accepting it yourself. And that is where, at least in the instance that you have provided, you have not fully committed to yourself. I will be an actress based on an external criteria rather than I am an actress now allow the reality to find me, and the reality will find an actress, because there are no jobs for someone who will be an actress. Oh, see what you're saying is... Well, I get all the sense. Yeah. That's what I said. I want to see. Okay. Do you understand the distinction? I do not wish in that sense to simply provide an elaborate set of semantics and increase the complexity. I wish to narrow it down and simplify that a slight shift in perspective creates a reality around it, allows you to reinforce the expression of the effortless actress, and it is no effort to be who you are. It is quite an effort, however, to continually become something you are not. That's so true. You are an actress. I am. Do you understand, and have even what you have just said to me, does that show you where you are still refusing to be an actress? Yeah. You are holding on to it. There is nothing in that sense happening to you. You are holding on to it. You are an actress. Are you not? Yes, I am. No. Getting there. One moment. Are you sitting up straight? No. Do so, please. If you wish. Take a deep breath. An actress has a certain posture. Assume that posture. The posture that you imagine an actress would have. Eyes closed if you wish. You are a pleasure. Now, someone who assumes that role in your society projects from themselves in a particular way that embodies conviction. They become someone else. So for now, act like you are an actress. Sit up straight and say, you are auditioning for me right now. I am an actress. And have you believed it? I am an actress. Thank you. I am an actress. You are absolutely going to get the job of becoming an actress. I am an actress. Do you have an investment in not being an actress? I really think I might only because I have always been told that if you are an actress, then you are frivolous or you are not helping people or you are never going to survive. You are going to be bankrupt. All that is true. All of it. But so is the fact that you can be an actress. Contribute to society. Create abundance. Share that abundance to make the world a better place. Full, are true. You need not assume one is true and the other is false unless you wish. Now, sit up straight and understand that when you say to me, I am an actress, you are the type of actress you desire to be. Yes, that other type of actress exists. But as you say, big deal. It is not the type you wish to be. Is it? No. All right. Can you imagine an actress that is positively abundant and that contributes through her trade and her conviction in her creativity to the enhancement of mankind and womankind? Can you imagine that? Yes. All right. Audition for me once again. Being that actress and say, I am an actress. I am an actress. How does that feel? Much better. Different from I am an actress, I think. That is what I mean by when you choose to express the belief being very clear about defining it. Being very clear about how you have already defined it, acknowledging the belief you have expressed, and then clearly defining the belief you wish to express and expressing it as I began by saying, expressing it belief leads to an emotion. It feels better, does it not? It feels much better. Now, you have not left your share and yet you have created both sets of emotions. When you said, I am an actress, I think, how does that feel? It's very insecure. So you change, you transform your emotions through awareness, through choice. Therefore, if you continue to be the actress you prefer, you will feel this more and more. And you will think differently because that is not a tentative, hesitant presentation, and you cannot help, but actively because you say so. Because there is a reflection of your choice and the trust and that choice. Now see what happens. You just did? Would you like to ask something else? Yes. With the financial situation in order to, I'm going to use that word again, okay, in order to be an actress in the biggest and best sense of the word, I need more training. Ah, another definition, do you really? Or yes and no? Is it both? Do you not have already everything you need to be the actress you need to be right now? And by being that actress should a role or should a situation come along that requires more training, wouldn't that actress just attractive without having to go after it? Is that just not yet another excuse of why you are not yet an actress? Yes. You are already an actress. You have all the tools you need for the first role that will come along if you choose to. Believe it, express it as a belief and act according to that belief. Is that too complex? No, it actually that clarified a lot. Does it feel different now still? Yes, it does feel different. Each time you feel insecure, understand, alright, alright, alright. I couldn't possibly make another decision unless I acknowledge what I am doing. Sit yourself up straight. Or just for yourself. I am an actress. Feel that feeling. Stand up. Move about. And you will change everything. But remember the definition of the type of actress you desire is an abundant actress. You had built into your definition the starvation factor. You are right. You are right. Now as far as the business is concerned, you are saying I could not... The business not begites you and will continue to be available as an option. So when that is the most exciting option by all means, go about it. The actress attracts whatever she attracts and may attract many different things that will enrich your life. And what excites you in that moment, though it may have nothing to do with acting, makes you know less than actress, but is part of the very training you are requesting through life, through experience. And the corporation job that means I can leave. Now that is up to you. Are you running from it or are you to visit for it? Oh, that is far different. Okay. Just one more thing. I recently had an experience with psychometry where I have been able to have psychic readings for a couple of friends of mine. I was tapped into this energy that I seemed to have. And I was wondering if you could tell me more about that. Well, the idea is you are expanding your definition of yourself and will attract various reflections for doing so. That when it's simply timely now, but is my perception temporal. But that is up to you. I'm not in best in what I am saying, allow your excitement to guide you. Okay, I didn't mean to go into it for a business. I just thought that... No, I understand. But you will explore many things. Life is the training. And exciting things will be more fun to learn. You need not factor out the fun. You need not factor out the joy. You can all function just as efficiently, joyously having fun as miserably dragging along. And you actually have the choice of joy. I think. Thank you. You like it? I really wasn't going to ask you, but I... Well, yes, you will. I have a son who's 18. We're going around in circles because he has done very well in school and he accepted it at wonderful university. And he is now in a quandary because he can't really picture himself knowing really with those schoolers' lives. And it's mostly...I'm not sure if this is...I know so many answers you get thrown back to around stuff. Oh, too high. But he must be electrical engineer with computer science. So he applied, not thinking he'd get a MIT, but he got a MIT. He also applied at Boston University because I just got divorced. And Luca, I said, you know, you can get that trust. He started everything paid for, as far as tuition, which he got. And he knows he doesn't have the name of MIT, but he also got in at Stanford in Cornell. So Cornell's out because it's too far. But now he doesn't know for his growth and development in life because he loves...he's a Taurus, but he's got a lot of Gemini. He loves things. He's an example thing that he's not sure. I think sometimes he doesn't have a social... Hopefully all the social skills. Sometimes I think he doesn't want this sort of demanding. I think he thinks, but I don't know how it really is. If MIT's gonna be too much for him, he can't decide. And I know it's his decision. But one day at MIT, the next day at Stanford, the next day at Boston University, and then we go around and say, The idea is simply this. There is an excitement or a drawing of one particular thing, and then there is the idea of, well, I should do this in that. If he can simply begin to trust which one he has drawn to, and trust that the reason that he has drawn is because it will benefit him most. That is the answer. And that will make more sense to him perhaps. Yes. That's nice. He asked me to see if I can really find a little guy. And he was a sheriff at the Easter web post too. Well, he has drawn more distinctly to one. He is. Right. Does he know inside? He can. Perhaps he knows outside as well. Now allow him to make the decision if you truly wish him to live the reality. Do you mind gluing him too much? Is it because the mother may be thinking? Because if he chooses to go to Stanford, it's a lot further away from home. Oh, I don't know maybe. What do you think? I try to give him, this is where I taught myself in an out of the school. Because I tell him different things that I think he should be aware of on that. And then before I know it, I'm also, so I want to think that I'm trying to be impartial. So I share the good that I point that I think I might be there. And I ask him to think about it and if he hasn't thought about it, maybe consider those things. But maybe I shouldn't be saying anything. Well, there are no should or shouldn't. There simply is what is. However, what I will share is that he has all the information he needs. And he will be in speed and he will make the right choice. No matter what, he will make a choice. But that choice can be most representative of who he knows himself to be. If you simply let him sit with the information that he has and make his decision and drop in that decision as well. If he has touched enough of himself, I think he is lots of times that he could know that. It is my perception that he is. He doesn't seem to be too worried by next Friday when the first comes around, I probably have it. And then he's very, but then he sounds so unsure today. Oh, well, it is May Day, perhaps he may. Maybe now, when I get tired of it, I don't want to take away from anyone else. No need to be concerned. He knows what he's doing. You have done a good job allowing him to stand on his own two feet. Pat yourself on the back and allow the situation to play. I'm going to sit back and thank you for sharing that. I feel quite relieved and I appreciate your being here tonight. You have done it all. I am simply a mural reflecting back your own spark. I thank you. Yee-bye. Shitti. Yay. She may. Are these chakras or do you have currently operating? I do not so much separate myself in such a way. I can, in that sense, access this idea would be quite similar to your own physically. But in general, do not make the distinction. So what you're saying they're all integrated? Well, there is this separation because I feel I'm a physical being in the potential to experience it that way. But I generally choose to see myself as one whole instead of a collection of parts. So operate as an integrated whole where all are functioning in tandem. One is a representation of each other. Do you understand what I am saying? Not totally. Oh, man. You are consciousness. Within that consciousness you create in physicality, body. That body can have particular quality. You can delineate or separate out as you begin to expand from being merely a contracted physical being as you expand and as you begin to explore your consciousness you will understand that things can fall and be perceived in a certain way. As again you expand from having no awareness of any of this, to having an awareness of the fact that perhaps there is more than meets the eye, what you call a little bit of a chakras become one of the, shall I say, points along the path of that expansion. Eventually you perceive the integration of all of these ideas and no longer separate yourself out into parts. It can still be experienced. It can still be drawn upon if there is a particular reason to do so. But in general there is not my reality. Okay, I understand that. Another question is what agreement do you have with the Canadians? Do you have an agreement with them to, I don't know, somehow a, it is loose if you would call it an agreement. There is an understanding, there is an overall respect, a common respect for again the sovereignty of your creativity. And again, many individuals will communicate as vehicles for any particular stream. Some may in that sense add their own perception, and others will be quite pure. Okay. Thank you. Again, there is an overall agreement of the respect. And we do not view you again as needing to do anything, as insisting that you do do anything. So when we are presented, either individually or collectively as doing so, generally, it is a coloration by the individual bringing it through. Is there something specific you are truly wishing to ask? No. It is up to you. I sense that there is. But it is up to you. Okay. What about the, um, the Great White Brotherhood? The Brotherhood of Winter Club? What's the question? You know what I'm talking about, don't you? I understand the collective energy designation that you are referring to. What specific are you asking? That would represent in general a more earthly presentation of consciousness. Then I get that much from what I'm asking. Oh. Thank you. Should you find more clarity and the ability to phrase it in a particular way, feel free to share again. All right? I thank you. Should I? No. May. Great to see you all. And who you? I would just ask you a question about a book that I'm reading called The Celestine Prophecies. Oh, right. Ask the way. Enjoy. And she said that it's the book about the transformation that the world is going through and saying that we're moving towards places operating more from our intuition than it will become a more harmonious planet and kind of feel the world that way. Deja. Yeah. That's a good question. Anyway, it says that humans historically have been involved in getting energy from each other by being in competition with each other and trying to beat other people and stuff like that. We're selecting energy to each other, but I understand what you mean, do you proceed? It says that the way that we can personally elevate our consciousness and improve our satisfaction with life is by getting energy from the infinite source, from just the infinite or whatever, all around us. Well, the recognition that you are the infinite and drawing upon yourself would be what I would add to that, rather than creating separation after separation after separation, which then creates an necessity for so much time to gather it back together. But that is one way to look at it. Well, instead of being stuck in competitive things with other people and trying to beat them and stuff so that I can feel better about myself or something, how then it says the way that we can make it. By the way, does that truly result in you feeling better about yourself or actually works? No, it might be a temporary I-it-best. In other words, if your game is at someone else's call, does that truly, from your most focused perspective, actually achieve that energy? No, I know from experience it doesn't work, so I want to transform it. Oh, go by the head? It's okay. Well, it says the one way we can bring in more energy to ourselves rather than needing to get it from others is by appreciating the beauty in other people and in things around us, and just plants or the natural world and stuff like that. Would you expand a little bit on how we can do that and also how we can kind of increase our own, other ways to increase our own vibration or get just feel more in power, bring in more energy from the universe? What you are saying boils down to feeling as though in order to validate yourself, there need be an outer reflection to prove to yourself that you are really worth it. The paradox here is that you come from a perspective that perhaps you are not worth it. Therefore, in a nutshell, as you say, though we have no nuts per se, unconditional self-love transforms this entire idea, for you are affording yourself that love to begin with, and then only can the external reality reflect it back to you. If you come from a position of not loving yourself, you will never truly find that love from an external source because you cannot escape from yourself and from the reality of who you choose to be. External reality will always mirror back to you where you are coming from. So you cannot ever actually find love externally till you listen to the wording, grant yourself that love for you. That is your own energy. You get no energy from anyone else. You produce your own energy and you use individuals as symbols for the quality through which you will produce and experience that energy. So bring it back to yourself. Self-love in and of itself is one thing. Unconditional self-love is something else. It means there are no conditions attached to the love of yourself, and therefore you cannot lose that love, and anything that you will think or do cannot actually result in the withdrawal of that love for there are no conditions placed upon it. So entertain the idea, define within your consciousness the existence of the idea of unconditional self-love and begin to afford it to yourself. Then everything else will fall into place. Then because you already love yourself again, external reality will reflect that love to you, perhaps by other seeming to love you, and also perhaps you will reflect to them that they are not loving themselves, and here is an example of an individual that does love themselves so it is actually possible. You become a service to yourself through choice, through perspective, but also automatically become a service to everyone else. So start with yourself. Does that make sense? Yes, yes it does. In a moment where I would like to ask the mechanics of granting myself unconditional self-love, the second thing that the Celesteing Trossey talks about is for control, promise that people adopt in childhood to supposedly get energy from others, intimidate or interrogate or elude and pour me, and it seems that I am adapting to someone who is using childhood use of... Stop, stop, stop. Listen up, all of that is available. The dance of perpetratorhood and victimhood is an available expression. All that you are about to continue to say assumes momentum, assumes that the path is the only reason you are the way you are right now. Again, if you assume that, I need not tell you, you experience that. But if you understand, this is how I am right now because I have the idea that this is possible and I will settle for no less, all of that becomes what was necessary to get you to this point. Same path, different usage in the moment of how you perceive it. Understand? Yes. Not satisfied. Well, I want to say, okay, knowing that the path doesn't have to define the presence, how can I adopt letting go of my old drama, which was kind of frustrating, sympathy for myself, saying, she would have tough life I had, and which is what I am familiar with, when I let go of that, there is a void there, and I think I could fill it with unconditional self-love. One moment, one moment, one moment. Letting go of that without first establishing who you are would, of course, seem to result in a void. But establishing who you are first in making that decision doesn't create a void, it creates a replacement, a transformation. Who do you wish to be? Do you wish to be the product of a dysfunctional path? Or do you wish to be a whole being now that experiences the seemingly dysfunctional path to discover who you are right now? That's absolutely what I want to be. You are it. How does it feel? It feels pretty good. Pretty good, then you are not it. I'm not totally it because I guess I get hung up on mechanics and futuring and needing to know exactly how I must do this. Do you wish to be a person who gets hung up in mechanics and does these things? No, I don't think- Alright! You have the choice. No, but you have the choice. Define clearly who it is you wish to be. Do not keep telling yourself who you were, who you do not wish to be later. Define it. Be specific. Well, still open that requires a future projection of what I must be and become. It requires a statement and a clarification. Perhaps the willingness to revise has anything would come to your awareness, but it is simply a statement, a choice, just decide. It is that simple. When you decide that you are a result of the path, you are doing exactly what I am saying, but not according to preference. Do you wish to make such a decision? Yes, I do. Describe the being that you prefer to be. Not by saying I am not this, I would prefer not to be that, but what you are, what you would prefer to be. I am unconditionally self-loving and I trust that what I am supposed to be will involve naturally or might just stay in the moment. Do you live in the past or the future or in the moment? Often in the past and future? No, no, no. I am asking you now to tell me who you prefer to be. I live in the present. I live in the present and trust that I will be what I am. I will follow my heart. Are you willing to trust that you are now that person? Yes. All right. What are you to begin to future and then remind yourself that you trust that you are that person? What would that person do if they began to future? The ground themselves in the present say I don't need to worry about that. You mean it, that simple? You mean to tell me that's all there is to it? Are you getting the point? Yes. Okay. For now, that will be. All right. Yes. We will speak again? No. Tomorrow. All right. Thank you. Hey, sweetheart. I'm thank you for calling on me again. The question that I'm now willing to ask is I read the book Bring a Pivodont and I think I'm talking about me. I think I'm one of those people. One of what people? I might not make it or would I make you do anything. I am simply asking you a question which you can always refuse to ask. One of the bringers of the Donative talking about. Oh, are you one of the bringers of the dawn that they're talking about or are you your own version of a bringer of light and dawn? My own version. Oh, why? That's it? You have just told me it is and that is all there is to it. Okay. But you need not attach yourself to any particular set of dogma. You can define what that means to you. All you needed from any particular symbol was knowing who you are. Now you write the book. You write the rules. Thank you. Oh, thank you for being so bright. Oh, come on. Hey, come on. Yeah, I'm not in my shape. I'm only something. I had a later decision a week ago that the United States military and that would be done effortlessly. And I know it can be done because I made a decision about something else before. And despite everything that reality would have told me it should be differently. It was the way I had rejected it. They created it today. This would not go in the way. I'm getting the kind of creative. Well, do you continue to act as a non-smoker and reassert or re-align yourself to being a non-smoker? Or are you seeing yourself as a smoker that is quitting and withholding a smoking? I'm trying to start seeing myself as a smoker to stay in your way home. Back and forth. Back and forth. That is why sometimes the resolve remains and other times it would seem in that sense to be a stroke. And simply understanding that you are doing this is your own language. There are smokers and there are breathers. A non-smoker implies that the norm is smoking and the non is an exception to the norm. Do you understand the distinction there is a difficulty in translation? Yes, no. And exactly what you mean. For me that's that, yeah, the non-smoking. That's how that sounds. Non-smoking still contains the word smoking within it is the point. Oh. Now do you smoke or not? No. Oh. Did this turn the case or does it seem superficial? It seems superficial. Oh. Thank you for being on. Do you feel like smoking right now? No. Oh. Why? Because I want to say like this, I want to teach this where I want to be a freezer. Why do you not feel like smoking right now? It wouldn't be because I can't accept the video. Oh. So is that truly not wishing to smoke or settling for not smoking? Yes. So do you perhaps wish to smoke right now? Yes. Now would a breather wish to smoke right now? No. Oh. What does that feel like when you entertain it for the fleeting moment that you are? Yes. Is it someone who is not doing something they wish to do or is it quite the opposite? Someone who is doing something they wish to do? Someone who is doing something that is the most. Has this be pierced the veil of superficiality? I don't know. Oh. Play around with it. When you feel should it ever return again perhaps it will not. As though you wish to smoke. Acknowledge what belief you are expressing in that moment. Bring up the other option, not the non-smokers, the breather. Feel that and compare them. And the simple willingness to delineate and compare, one will feel far preferable to the other and assists you in accelerating this idea. And that's not one of the things I'm afraid of is that I'm making it into an effort and I'm making it into a struggle. Well the breather would not do that. So again if you are doing that, acknowledge it. Find what belief you are expressing, remembering that you contain both. Reaffirm the belief you prefer and then trust in that and act according to the belief that you prefer. Does this feel more meaningful? Yes, it does. I'm so curious. I know right now at this point it can go either way. Oh the breather is not clear. So when you feel that fear, first of all, feel it. An emotion is a result of a belief you are expressing. Feel the feeling. Allow yourself to fully feel it. And then acknowledge the belief you are expressing. When you pose the alternative belief in a certain, you will feel differently. But do not deny the fear. Allow it to deliver its message to you. Dive into the fear. It is actually again the fear of the fear more than the fear that is actually causing the discomfort. The fear you simply feel, it plays out. All right now what? All right what belief must I have been expressing? This one, all right well I don't feel it anymore. I already expressed it. What belief do I prefer to express? I am a breather. How does that feel? Oh, it's different. It doesn't feel fearful. And you transform the fear. Not deny it or attempt it to get rid of it. And I remind you there's nowhere to put it. This is one of the things that what's making this hard for me is that recently I've gone through having like a whole belief that completely flipped around and it's almost like everything that I believe was true in ideas. Well again, arguing this is true and that is not true may perhaps always feel that way. Accepting that both are true and you get to choose turns the key. That might be why this is coming to itself. Well it is allowing you more to explore what we are seeking of foundational fundamental ideas to assist you in yourself and power than actually any particular symbol smoking included. Oh thank you. You're not? Male. You're not. Are you still physically in our galaxy? At this particular timing I am around, shall I say my own homeworld of Edna Kong. So you went back to the Three Scout Crafts and gone back? I will be again visiting your proximity in what you call your June July month. Why? Various reasons. One of them is to as you say observe a particular comic event. But that's what you were observing before. I have a reference to this I have not observed the particular event though event leading up to. So the comic is going to hit Jupiter. That is one of the ideas and that will send some sort of ripple effect on our planet. That will do what it will do and we will observe. That might my love to heal you. I thank you as well. I do not cut you off. I do not stop you from expressing yourself. I carefully coordinate our interaction. Are you beginning to understand through some of the sharing with others what we were discussing earlier? I have a question about my son. I have spoken about him with you before. He had cancer in his right leg and he had a bone transplant done. At this point in time everything seems to be, everything is fine except for the fact that now his left leg, which is his normal leg, is growing and is longer than his right leg, which is the leg with the bone transplant. We have scheduled an operation for him a week from yesterday up in Massachusetts to stop the growth in his femur in the hopes that this operation will correct the growth enough so that both legs will become close to even by the time he reaches his full height. Hold on. Very clean. We have chosen this option because the other option would be to allow his growth to continue putting a lift in his shoe until he reaches his total height. I am doing a more major surgery which would cut, have to cut the bone down again and then allow it to knit together. We have allowed him to have an input into the decision and his decision was to go with the least amount of pain and the easiest option which is to stop the operation. My question is are we doing the right thing? There truly is no right and wrong, simply different options. He is telling you that the symbol, the elaborate set of symbols in this case, that he will at this point require with his current understandings about what you call life is the particular symbol that he has chosen to allow himself to heal himself. I am sorry, I don't understand. His input into the decision is what he feels is the best. Ultimately he heals himself. Due to the elaborate nature of how his particular scenario has set itself up, that is the way that he believes is most likely that he will allow himself to do so. He factors out that he heals himself. He feels that this procedure will heal him. But ultimately that is not the true mechanism. That procedure allowed him to convince himself that now it is a right to heal. This has been done and it can heal. Do you understand the distinction? Not quite. I mean I know from his perspective he feels that he is healed from the cancer. When that step hurts, I believe that he is... The lead lead at this point in his understanding as you know him, that he without any intervention could heal himself and have his legs grow at an even rate. All right. Because of it, and again the elaborate set of symbols and circumstances that have played out in your reality, does he believe that the particular set of symbols, what you are calling the operation, will result in that normalization? Yes. So that is then the methodology through which he will allow himself to heal himself. And I am wording it this way to illuminate the actual process that occurs. Is this more clear? It is more clear. The other possibility was an option of trying to do something with him with self-healing. And I haven't been able to explore that totally. And I wondered if that... If that might be another way to go with him. He is not the one exception to you create your own reality. So that is another option. But to say what is right or wrong is completely arbitrage. So therefore it will depend upon his definitions, his beliefs, your definitions, your beliefs and his relationship to them. You are asking me to make a decision for you that I cannot make. It would be remiss to do so. I guess that is what it is. Okay. Now, I can share that there is a likelihood, a very strong likelihood, that he will get the desired effect, no matter what he does. I mean, I believe that he believes that he is healed with the cancer. And that was our biggest concern. As of right now, he is from my perception. Now he can continue to create that, or not, but he can continue to create that. Allow him to learn about some of the things we discussed as well. Should you so choose. He creates from the moment as well. All right. I have a question now also about Elissa has to deal with my mother, who I've also mentioned to you before. She has had several relapses over the past few months where she needed radiation treatment. And it seems to me that every time her treatments are going well and a thing seem to be clearing up, something happens to step her back. And I wondered if you could give me some ideas about what's going on with her. Have you shared with her the idea that all the seeds is simply a message on heeded and allowed her to entertain the notion of allowing the symbol to deliver a message and using the message that it delivers? I have not done so, but I believe a friend of mine has. Oh, are you not aware of it as well? Do you not have a particular relationship with her as well? I am aware of that. And I have been trying lately to connect, I guess, is the thing. To let her know that she needs to do the things that are best for her and that I need to do the things that are best for her. That does not mean you cannot share what you understand to be true for yourself, which is being responsible to her without needing to be responsible for what she does with it. In other words, share what you know without being hooked that you take it in a certain way. You will be doing all that you can do in the situation. And you will be giving your gift to her. I guess that's the thing I have difficulty with, sharing it with her and then not having her understand or sharing it with her and then having to do it with her. Taking responsibility for the information and how she takes it. Now I am presenting to you the option of not doing it. Simply saying, here is what I have learned. Here is what I have experienced. How does it sound to you? She will say, oh, sounds very good. Never thought of that. Either way, she will have defined herself still further and you will have been of assistance. I guess I am afraid she will say both. I will be back to square one or I will be the first of all. Well, how could she be worse? Well, you have to write the credit, you know what to do. If you will share the gifts that you have, also giving her the receipt to return them if she does not desire them, you will be of service regardless of her decision. That I can share with you. Thank you very much. There is no coincidence or shall I say it is a complete coincidence, but no accident that you know what you know. She is experiencing what she is experiencing and you have a unique perspective about it. Give her at least the credit to share it with her. I would like to thank you. Everything that has gone off tonight is a really, really hit home for me. Well, me too and I thank you. You don't have your mind? Male, in the back that has not interacted with us before. You don't mean me, I am sure. You said? You mean the mind, okay. Thank you. Greetings. No, no, you are right. You said I don't mean you. No. No, no, no. Go ahead. I am speaking to another channel. No. Oh, thank you. You are the boss. Yes, I am a channel. Thank you. You sound like you mean? I do. I am. You are? Yes. I wanted to discuss a phenomenon that I experienced when I first did it. Hey. That experience was, I had just fallen into it in the conversation with my mother. I just started channeling. Oh, Holly, it was. At the time, it very much was. Still. I had, when I came out of it, about two hours of aftermath activity. Half an hour of it was at full bore. The aftermath was one of perceiving our so-called reality. It was very flat. No depth to it. And a certain knowledge that it was not real. Oh, further. I felt like I was rattling round in my body, not quite connected. From your perspective, what was this? In allowing yourself to express that much more of your own energy through the form of what you prefer to have other entities. You took on or identified very strongly with a vibration that is slightly, shall I say, more dimensional than your normal third density or third dimensional reality. Now, different individuals will label this in different ways. From my particular perspective, you experience how third density can look from a fourth density perspective. Now, individuals will have different terminology for this. Some will call what I am calling fourth density fifth. But in my understanding, fourth density is still physical. It is a more expanded physical dimension. Fifth density is actually non-physical altogether. Now, the entities that you are interacting with are in that sense physical or quasi-physical. So, you experience perhaps temporarily how third density might be viewed from a fourth density perspective, but you did so through third density eyes. Now, this becomes difficult to explain in its entirety. But the idea is when I am viewing you from fourth density perspective, you lack a particular dimension that I see in my reality. However, I still see the other what you call three dimensions. You, however, have not been used to seeing a fourth dimension, and therefore the only way you could translate the difference was to seemingly create a one step removal dimensional perception in actuality once again. This was perceived because you were seeing it through third density eyes as only two dimensional. Does this make any sense? Yes, it does. It is not a word that's called a vertical term. It is a fourth or a fifth dimensional being. It is different. But it is how one dimension less would appear to a third dimensional being. So, you had an expanded experience through a contracted sense. Does that make sense? Yes. Now, what you call the rattling around phenomenon, very very creatively worded I might add, is simply again one of the experiences that one may create when they understand on any level that your body exists within your consciousness and not the other way around. When individuals experience what you sometimes refer to as out of body, literally all you are doing is shifting your viewpoint but still within your consciousness. You are in one sense closing the eyes of your consciousness at one point within the sphere as an analogy of your consciousness, opening them at another point, seeming from that point to be out of the body but in that sense still within yourself. And this can take many different gradient form. The rattling or the shaking was the idea of shifting your point to do very slightly. Now, did that translate? Yes. I don't think I will prepare it, Arks, but it does. Thank you. Now you are getting the idea. When you begin to look at things from a slightly expanded dimension, something arises as normal that you consider now to be abnormal which is paradox. Paradox is allowing you to see that you are now expanding your consciousness, do not need to assume that it has to be this or that, that it can be both and that will appear from this point of view as you say, as paradoxical. Both the end opposing. But not opposing necessarily simply different. Opposing is a judgment that is placed from this perspective. No, but go existing at the same time. Thank you. Oh, thank you for your willingness to open up and share the energies that you are pretty to with others. Thank you for sensing that I was calling you. Oh, my question. Thank you for calling me so loudly. We have time for about one more sharing today. Eli, I was listening to the previous conversation and I have a question because I don't quite understand. My feeling or thinking was when a person channels they did not recall any of the channels in the process. I understand that channeling is simply anything that you dive into with no doubt and no hesitation. And the gradient of this experience is absolutely across the board. What you are experiencing before you is sometimes referred to in your own definitional nomenclature as the transchannelling whereby the consciousness of the channel in that sense is diffuse to allow me to communicate and in that sense may not perceive the words. This is generally referred to in your terminology as a deeper trans state. However, there are lighter states. What you call a medium trans state, still very intense, still very connected where the individual does hear the word. There is light state where individuals actually have their eyes open and are speaking in a normal tone of voice but receiving through their intuition certain ideas. But to expand the definition still further, you as a physical being are channeling, perhaps you can say an aspect or a spark of your higher self. So your life is a channeling. Anything you do with no doubt, no hesitation is a channeling. Does this assist? Yes, thank you very much. Thank you. At this timing, allow me to thank you all for both providing me the perspective of a possible view from upon the fence and at the same time allowing yourselves to see that you can very strongly dive into your reality from that fence once you have partaken of that view. Seeing where you are has the value of allowing you to decide if you wish to remain where you are in terms of your approach or wish to transform. Everything occurs right now. If you say right now, I am the person I prefer to be, you are. And if you continue to trust that and act that way, you continue to be from this point forward, no process necessary, no long struggle necessary. You can continue to create that. And if that is what you will feel you require to decide in another successive now moment that you have changed, so be it. But that is the mechanism. No process actually alters you. You at some point down the line decide in a moment just as I am sharing with you now, I have changed and then you say, well, I can give myself the permission to have changed because I created this lengthy process and I'm through. That is one way to do it. But it is not the only way. So I thank you so much for your willingness to share with me on this level of intimacy and I bid you a most fond and loving pleasant dream each and every one of you. And good evening.
