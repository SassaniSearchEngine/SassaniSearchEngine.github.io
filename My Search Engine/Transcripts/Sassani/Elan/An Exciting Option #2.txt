 All right, I'll say, before we continue, allow me to say, depending upon the playing out of specific scenarios which are occurring now upon your planet within your various cultures and your various societies. There is an increased degree of likelihood that within what you call the next year of your time, and perhaps in that sense beginning within the next two or three months of your time, you will begin to see more public disclosure of information about the existence of what you call extraterrestrial life. The idea as we have shared many times is that many individuals in your society are already aware of our existence, and in that sense, more and more of what you call a critical mass is being reached within the mass consciousness of your planet that will allow for this knowledge, again, if certain things play out according to how they seem to be playing out, for this knowledge to become more commonplace. Therefore, you can, as you say, keep your eyes and ears open, and you will begin to see what will appear to be stronger evidence of such things. I simply tell you this as a way of preparation. It is in that sense an inevitable occurrence, and its likelihood has increased due to certain again specific happenings, and so therefore, figured I'd let you in on it in that way. Thank you, and do proceed with sharing. It's denial. Great thing. And to you. Couple things. I read a book called Journey of Soul. Oh, why? Are you familiar with that? Define. Newton, I believe it. He's a Ph.D. Newton is the name of the author. Is it what? Michael Newton. He's a therapist, and what he's done is gotten in touch with the super consciousness of people, and it's been into their life between lives. Like once they leave their body and they're in between, you know, choosing to come back in. I just wondered if you could comment on the book and how valid, or I shouldn't say how valid, but... Oh, I do understand in that sense. I have not read the book. The idea is that there is experience what you perceive to be between lives, for you are uninterrupted whole consciousnesses, and therefore you do perceive something, what you call between lives. In terms of the information in that book, I cannot comment upon it, for I am not specifically aware of it. Is there a specific question that you have? No. Let me get to my next thing. All right. To simply conclude that idea, and because, and therefore, because you are able to have an experience, it would be a possibility to in that sense create a memory or an experience of that type of idea. So what you are suggesting through what you call deep meditation, through what you sometimes refer to as hypnosis, can produce results to give you a sense of the type of experience that does happen by tapping directly into the experience, however, you as individuals, finite beings, if you will, entities, if you will, interpret your understanding of your reality and yourself through the terms that you create yourself to function through. And so therefore when individuals will recall such an experience, they can only in that sense translate it in terms that will make sense to the experience you are having now. Now some of the in between life experience is indeed similar and therefore lends itself to such translation. Other aspects of that experience by definition are so completely different than the finite entity experience that attempting to translate the experience would automatically, all right, perhaps diluted and not have it be specifically accurate. So such an idea is certainly possible. You can certainly glean information that way. You can certainly learn or get a sense of the phenomenon, but there is an aspect of it that will not translate and so all of these translations will be somewhat biased. All right. Okay. It was interesting. It was just very exciting to book. I have a question. There is a woman that a friend of mine is a neighbor of her. She is a 28 year old woman and she went into a coma about three months ago. She has got three kids. She is married. And you know, out of the blue, she is one of her coma. This past week her husband has now been able to communicate with her by her blinking her eyes yes or no to communicate and share with her and let him know that she understands what he's saying to her. All right. How exciting. Yeah. Can you say anything or comment on this about her condition? My initial perception and this is simply that a perception by me is that from what I am sensing, she will continue to improve. Now this is not necessarily as you say definite though most likely. Today they just put in numerous volunteers and people who donated gravel and trees and shrubbery and flowers and whatnot and a number of volunteers put in a new driveway and you know, preparing for the time she comes home. Oh my. Well speaking on the subject you are talking about tonight about you know, creating a reality, the way you prefer, the way you want it, doing what excites you most. I've just begun to embark on that or on in it and choosing to create the life that I prefer, knowing that I can have a job or create you know, the thing that excites me most in my life. And I began my own business and of course I still believe I have to work this whole time job in order to you know, create and be the artist and do the business you know with it. I have to have a job with it. All right. That is not necessarily so but I understand what you are saying and that into some degree is what I was addressing at the beginning. The time that you take to put into the job to create your security leaves you less time to do the exciting thing and so therefore you can still accomplish in that sense the exciting goals though the time frame then spreads out for it is not a contiguous, continuous uninterrupted, exciting commitment. So therefore by all means you can do it that way though you may find as you say ups and downs when in that sense you can completely commit to it then you have more time for it and your productivity doing that specific exciting thing raises and then brings in what you call the abundance. Okay. No I am not saying by any means quit your job. Simply saying in that sense that when you are doing anything in lieu of your excitement that is time you are spending not doing what excites you. Yeah. And many individuals will actually create a life that consists of 90% doing what does not excite them to support 10% doing what excites them. Well I know that eventually or very shortly in about six to eight months I will no longer need that job. I really truly believe that and I am creating that right now. Then your gradient approach in that sense can have the result that you seek. Yeah. Though you may find it somewhat of a roller coaster ride from now to then. Yeah. But I thank you for what you shared earlier and being it and living it and choosing to consciously create my life and do what excites me most and it is working and it is fabulous. What do you find to be the number one benefit of being willing to commit to your excitement. I don't know the sense of accomplishment like I am discovering this amazing talent I have as an artist. It is something I have always been but I have never pursued it in a really focused manner or allowed myself to flow with it and do some work and accomplish some things and it is just really exciting to do the work and to discover that I can create a beautiful thing that I can share with somebody else or because I am going to have a t-shirt and a sweatshirt and business along with doing my fine art. It is just very exciting and fulfilling to feel purposeful in doing something that makes me totally joyful and excited. Did you find that the first step in the process was indeed making a decision and then subsequently trusting that decision continuously? Absolutely and I am still and that was another thing I kind of wanted to share with you. I still feel like I get pulled back into it right. All of my patterns of negative thinking and that was one of the questions I had which I know I am choosing to create it. I am choosing to limit myself. So let's look at it from the most constructive terms with a simple reminder that doubt is not a lack of trust. Doubt is a complete unswerving trust in the thing you say you don't prefer and understanding this then you can realize that you always have trust. Need not build it up, need not flex the trust muffle. It is there already and simply in noticing where you are placing the trust is in and of itself enough to say ah look we are unplacing my trust. Look where I desire to be trust, move over and realigning your trust with your decision. All there is to it. Doubt is not a lack of trust so when you feel that simply say alright alright I feel this I won't invalidate how I feel. What is it that I am trusting and when you allow yourself to identify that the thing that you are actually trusting is simply no longer relevant to your present decision and therefore it is no big effort or big deal as you say to simply realign that trust realizing where you have allowed it to stray. That is in and of itself a simple enough distinction to allow you to transform that. I know what you are saying but it is funny how you know you get taken back into some other negative thought pattern and you feel that energy and that just kind of comes in and it is like a meal. You are out of table and many different place are placed in front of you. You can say I feel the energy of this lobster or you can simply say I prefer these potatoes. It is as simple as that. Yes there may be an odor, there may be a feeling, there may be an energy associated with the negative trust but it is not a power. It is simply a characteristic of the option and so therefore again that distinction allows you to say alright alright I am now experiencing this nuance of this negative option but in even calling it an option I remind myself there are other options. I can sit and ponder and linger and judge myself for having chosen this option or I can simply say alright what is it that I wish to align to? What is my preferential decision? Then again you are not running from any seemingly side stepping trust. You are simply moving back toward the trust that you know is representative of who you are even in those moments of so called out. You still know in no uncertain terms if you are willing to be honest with yourself who you know yourself to be. So simply remind yourself it is very simple. Keep it simple and it will be experienced simply. It seems to be working so much easier when I do fall back into some other negative or limiting thought I can get myself out of it because of the excitement that I have generated for what I know I truly want to do absolutely by realigning to the excitement but I also remind you that never can you actually be the old self. The moment you have new knowledge saying you are the old self is simply a misidentification for you are if anything the old self with new knowledge which is not the old self and so therefore understand that knowledge is the key to expanding your awareness of more of your own self and there is no turning back. You can simply seem to experience what you call back sliding but the thing that makes you realize that it is a completely new experience and in fact an opportunity to align to the positive thing is simply reminding yourself. Alright I am trusting in something that is non preferential. There I said it I admitted it and it is not where I wish to place my trust where do I wish to place my trust well I am this positive productive person who does this oh yes I remember that. Alright now that I have two things to place on the table which one would I rather eat. Alright I can certainly eat the dish that is disempowerment on a plate or I can in that sense simply realize this will obviously taste better and choose it by allowing yourself to identify your options simply identify them you automatically equal life and for no option literally speaking has any more weight than any other option so simply understand alright I am making a choice I didn't realize I was but now that I am saying it I do and now I will make a new choice it is very simple and perhaps if you were really the old self you couldn't think this way you didn't have access to that knowledge or shall I say did not express that knowledge you already did contain it but we're not yet expressing it now you are that makes all the difference now how do you feel about it I feel great now would you actually be willing to invite some doubt so you can test it out. Alright but you will find you will indeed have that sense of challenge for you will understand that once you are completely committed to who you are nothing in that sense can interrupt it and everything else is simply a bit of spice to the plate. Now do I create that challenge I mean I always I create a lot of challenge in my life I have. By the way you can call a challenge and indeed it can feel a challenge or it can simply be opportunity to realign period period this allows me to see who I am not which is a tool to align to who I am period and it need not serve any more function than that unless you insist that it does in which case you can then dive into what that means to you. Does that make sense? Yeah I have to hear that again but yeah well if something specific comes up as a question do ask. Thank you. I thank you as well. Hey male over there. I have a friend who is a travel agent tour guide and making tourists to different places she would like to know what is going on. One moment. When in that sense such a guesstimate is put forth it is very variable and it is simply a in that sense sensing of what is in place right now but for such a thing to be in that sense in that type of organizational structure it is my perception you are talking approximately twenty to twenty five of your years in that form now that does not necessarily mean that individuals will not have such an opportunity soon. I thank you. Is that all? Yes. All right. Allow me to also say that all seats are in first class and there are no layovers. Shitting. Hey man. I have a question still bugs me. Still bugs you. All right. Do proceed. You know I work with people for healing. All right. I believe that we create the illness so we can learn from it. All right. Not always do individuals do that with the knowing this that that itself and often it can be that individuals have refused to heed the feedback that they are giving themselves in their reality and have done so to such a critical point where they now create a symbol that forces them to have to look at something or literally perish. Now individuals who choose to look at it can transform it individuals who have the same right to choose not to look at it can simply perish. So I work with people to look at that to recognize to learn from the illness what they set the illness up for to learn. All right. How do you word that to the individual? Depends on the individual. All right. Man make a simple overall template suggestion. All right. I would say to an individual. All right. I know. I can tell simply by interacting with you that you know everything that is absolutely horrendously horrible about the experience that you are having. Correct? They will say yes. Correct. I would say all right. Do one thing to simply see what comes up. Tell me what the illness has forced you to do that has actually has a positive outcome that you would not have done without it. And when the individual identifies that generally it will bring up a spark of recognition within them. Another way to put it is now that you know all the horrendous things that seem to occur from this. What positive things have you actually learned from it? Those are the two ways to put it that we find most conducive. Do proceed. Well now what you're saying about being someone different. In other words changing who you are. So someone's doing something that's detrimental to them. An addiction. And there's an experience that you need to learn from that before they get rid of this addiction. My thing once said okay I'm going to change who I am. I'm going to be this other person. And then might they just fall back to who they were because they didn't learn the lesson to begin with? Not if they truly make the decision and maintain that decision no matter what external feedback comes up. If the external feedback is taken as an opportunity to change their decision back then yes it can seem as though they've changed back. Now actually they're a new person with some old habits. But the idea is that it will be up to whether or not they are willing to maintain the decision. The moment they decide I am this new person they are. As they maintain that decision they continue to be that person. The moment they change their mind for whatever reason they become the person they change their mind to be. So though it may seem to play out the way you are saying what I am sharing is the mechanism. And the solution is to remain focused on the decision. Maintain that decision which is the same as trust that decision as having already stuck and continue to have your actions be a reflection of that decision not some other decision. If they do that there won't be any seeming reversion to old tendencies. I guess I'm mixed up. Oh I do proceed. Confusion is the beginning of putting things back together. Go fusing. You see I mixed up healing with addiction. A lot of times in addiction you have to hit bottom. Generally speaking what you call an addiction which can be the idea of them teaching themselves something with external symbols is more specifically the idea of placing your power outside of yourself on a symbol that you assume has more power than you. So they are in lies of distinction. When an individual can understand that they create the effect and the tool is simply a prop then the tool becomes irrelevant. So it simply depends on the nature of what you are calling the addiction and the specific things that are in place you can dialogue with those specifics in any situation. Most times the addiction in itself is a lesson in you are taking the power away from yourself. Generally speaking and generally speaking there is also the undertone that you are not already complete and therefore where do you look to become complete when you believe yourself to exist within a reality as maybe a grain of sand within a humongous reality. You look to external sources and symbols for validation. This creates that type of what you refer to as dependency. When they understand foundationally or even are introduced to the notion that they might already be a complete whole being that is the hinge to begin to nurture this knowingness is understanding that exists within all entities all being for somewhere within you all is the notion of understanding you are already whole and that idea of not feeling whole and needing to make yourself whole by gathering external symbols need not only take the form of what you call substance abuse. It can also be what you call co-dependent relationships and things of this nature as well. Anything external that you feel only with this thing will I be complete is another way of saying you don't already understand yourself as complete which means you are trusting that you are not complete and I remind you that is a decision. It is not anything inherently so and therefore when you say all right I do yes I trust I am not complete. You can then pose an alternative an exciting option I am complete all right here are two options I am not complete and I am complete. Now from what I am understanding learning all this stuff from a lab they are actually paradoxically both true what a quandary they are both true I am not complete and I am good how can they both be true well they are both inherent statements that are neutrally true the one that I choose the one that I decide will be the one that determines my actions and those actions will give me the effect of one truth being my truth and so therefore by simply allowing an individual to say I trust that I am not complete they see here is an option here is where my trust is and allows them to play around with providing other options. So you do have to you do have to find you do have to recognize that you are not complete before you can choose to be complete not necessarily you can by choosing to simply be complete bypass the whole mechanism but what I am saying is if you have someone who is particularly stubborn you can pose it to them in that way to at least let them see they have the option deciding that you are complete by making the decision I am already complete all bets are off all history is off all the shackles and chains of closets and subconscious is all it's only relevant once you acknowledge that you are complete so you can identify where you are placing your trust and move it over or you can bypass that whole step and simply create a new focus which when you then engage in that focus distances you from the old focus automatically. So when the old focus sneaks up on you like it always does like it never. When you re establish your focus and I will call it an old option presents itself not something sneaking up on you it is no longer meaningful it has become irrelevant you may say oh look at that I used to think that way but it doesn't have power it doesn't grab you it doesn't sneak up on you hit you on the head and tie you up unless you create that appearance there are many different ways to create commitment to the decision and one of them can be to realize everything you have ever done in VIN that creates a long process however and ultimately when that process is over you do the same thing you could do right now which is saying now that I've gotten rid of all that stuff I am this ultimately you're still saying I am this you're still making that decision so you can do that clearing the air or you can simply make that decision and anything in your reality that's inconsistent with that decision will present itself and give you an opportunity to realign to that decision and soon we'll seem to completely disappear and fade as even an option is this making sense is that too simple and too good to be sure it's so simple it's hard to grasp oh levels of complexity all right well the idea is is grasp you you need not grasp it you are already whole already and even when you play the game of saying I am not whole you are a whole being saying you're not whole I like to share something with you I learned all right you had a day by all means by all means do I was working with a young lady that's problems with her brain to the doctor say that she has more psychosomatic but they're giving her a lot of pills and makes her tired and she has erratic brain waves or something but anyway we were doing a healing and she was in trance and she pictured a red ball that was putting out energy and we used that to eradicate this disease now what are you trying to perform but do proceed or transform the disease not eradicate but do proceed if I can use the word perish you can use the word eradicate what I learned from that was that when I work with people for healing I do not have to guide them all the time this most I've heard they pick up they create but if they truly want to heal themselves they create something to do that they actually create the tool themselves though your role as support and as perhaps you can say a shepherd in that sense is quite valid and useful you simply facilitate them to assist themselves so I'm learning that and each individual is something that each time I do this I learn something new and a different tool that they use it so the question that I'm asking myself is how many tools I have to learn before I become a master and what is your answer to yourself all right either that or one what decide period the tool of being willing to decide who you are rather than being dictated to in making that decision choosing who you are your own self from your own heart and your own knowing this rather than what circumstance seems to suggest you are and rather than what other individuals seem to insist you are period only you know you anyone else can only guess it's still it's no reason to stop now I must you insist thank you very much thank yourself did you thank yourself and for the first time sessions ago really asked a question that I found very amusing because it revealed that you don't use clocks or make appointments in your plan one other question about your plan or your shifts what degree of any medicine exercise what you call zero we do not in that sense include as part of our exploration the idea of imbalance and what you call this ease in that sense will generally be the result of an imbalance therefore by being willing to observe our reality and act upon it with no hesitation the idea of imbalance simply does not come up there can be from what you call time to time the idea of what you would perhaps refer to ads I find that there is not much vocabulary to communicate this idea one moment perhaps I can say were some version of such a thing to occur it would a not be painful and be not require attention perhaps that is the most neutral way to state it another direction the me that I am in this life that personality or the personalities it from my other life do they exist in a conscious way forever in other words is there always I think therefore I am kind of literally yes one something existed always exist and on the other hand you cannot imagine anything unless it exists somewhere do remember that reality is infinite the idea from the perspective that you are asking the question is evil seem to be continuous though you will have memory of others that you have been you still may most strongly identify with who you have most recently been you will in that sense have more access to other ideas again the ones that will stand out other lives that will stand out are the ones that are more relevant to who you are but this is true for each life they seem to flow continuously so you appear from your perspective to continue to be the same entity experiencing different types of ideas others in their own point of view will have their own consciousness perhaps you can put it that way yes there are very many different ways to look at this and that is why the answer may seem in that sense a bit halting it depends what perspective you are looking at it from as to what the experience will be that's the most important I'd like to ask a question for someone else more question by proxy for my mother her sister disappeared a couple years ago her name is Rose and there are several scenarios but nobody really knows if she still lives or what she's experiencing the most grateful for any light you like to share I find it this time I have none I thank you as well there will be but a few more sharing sharing last July I went to see a woman who I will call a medic position all right and what and I went to her for physical complaints that I was having that doctors couldn't determine what defined well this doesn't have this is just why I went to her I had lost a lot of weight about ten pounds and I was exhausted all the time and she did a vibrational reading and came up with some physical reasons why this may be happening to me which satisfied me it was better than the doctors for but then she went on to ask me if I wanted to have a spiritual reading and I said yes and a number of entities that she called spirit guys came in and then there was one that really kind of surprised her and me too a little bit and she said it was an entity from serious the star system serious and that in fact I was visiting serious every night and had been for many months and I'm reporting for a scene if this your perception well when she said it to me I was upset but then she said they would they wouldn't do this without your invitation and then I remembered that in fact the prior January I had issued an invitation oh oh not specific to anyone but that I did want to visit actually other planet born so she didn't really tell me anything a whole lot more other than that well basically that's because it is up to you to explore right except it did explain to me maybe why I was always so tired and could never get up in the morning I go to bed early and wake up exhausted so then by the way ironically from my perception one thing has nothing to do with the office now you are busy but that busy net in that sense is a natural function and does not require what you call energy bodily energy in the way that you define so the so-called exhaustion is a separate issue my question has to do with I had no conscious recollection whatsoever of any of this and I wouldn't have minded or I don't mind visiting other planets that this possible for me to do this however I want to know about it always then when you are as you say falling asleep for the next three nights of your time simply remind yourself that you will bring back some symbol some portion some meaning of the experience and when you awake query yourself you will find things will come up subtle and whatever it is that comes up do not minimize it use it for what it is worth that will allow you to retain more understand also the following as we had said before about between life experience some of the experience you have will not easily lend itself to translation you do not drag your body along it is a consciousness experience and some of it is rather foreign to your way of being so a large percentage of it will simply not be translatable you can however use the symbols that you do get to make it practical and useful on this level are you willing to do that oh that would be my first suggestion now on to the exhaustion in that sense what is it that you are truly excited about that you are not doing and in doing so how long will you continue to resist who you know yourself to be which can be exhausting well as far as what it excites me that I'm not doing there are quite a number of things that excite me all right pick one to give a simple I have a great deal of time narrowing anything down to picking one all right now pick one what would what I would find the most exciting to do would be to write a book incidentally for a person having trouble narrowing down just one you did just fine well I think what would be the best all right that is what I asked what in that sense would your book be about the book which I have begun is really about God and religion all right do you find this exciting are you conveying that excitement through your writing I think that I convey that excitement on a conversational basis I don't know that it's conveyed through my writing because no one has read it other than me and it's really more in outline and a few chapters stages then my simple suggestion would be as you flesh out your outline to become the actual content that you allow your inspiration and excitement about whatever your perception is and whatever you have to say about God to come out in the writing so that those reading it will be excited and energized by what you have to say and that will make all the difference taking the excitement that you already experienced it and communicating it so that you have an exciting book about God does that make sense is that many ways not the missing element for what bringing your outline to fruition I'm not really sure all right play around with the idea that you are very excited about what you are writing about and allow that to come through when you actually commit to fleshing out the outline and you will find a very joyous thing to occur also the degree to which you are willing to get down to the actual writing will also begin to result in what you call new vim and vigor can you grow my children up faster so that I have more time and you allow them to be a serendipitous part of the process and not an interruption in it sure oh perhaps that is more conducive than growing them do you understand the sense of what I am saying if you stay focused on what excites you you will be too energized and excited to even know what exhaustion is if you deny that and continuously do things that are truly almost the opposite of the thing that excites you you will continue to drag your feet and allowing this all to be that simple and getting down to the business of aligning to who you are and being that person can allow you even tomorrow morning to wake up fully refreshed as far as serious is concerned or any night travel that I'm doing I should just for three nights say I want to remember this there are no should the idea is if you are willing to begin to simply request the symbol you will get it and the symbol will not be extraneous it will be something that you can use in other exciting endeavors as well it all ties together when you allow all exciting things to actually be different facets of the same crystal interesting you said the word crystal because what this woman told me what I was doing there is because I had a great deal of knowledge about crystals and in fact had spent a lot of time with our on serious long ago during the time of Atlantis and that I had a lot of knowledge crystal works and that just knowledge is presumably being reawakened but and I did try going to bed and asking to be given a symbol but I can do it for three nights what happens is I have just completely heard of all by the way commit to it do not try it do it and understand three nights will increase the momentum but if you choose in that sense to continue it past that by all means do you will get more and more my simple suggestion of three nights is simply to create some commitment and consistency and when the symbols begin to come by all means continue to do that you need not stop after three thank you thank you I made a decision all right necessary you want to tell me proceed and that last year and it has to do with the blue crystal skull all right that I've been interested in in a while and I've decided that in just the normal conversation that I have with you that you could share with me approximately is location of the plant absolutely true I could now all we require is for me to decide that as I have said before I would not come to your tree and open all your Christmas presents for you I will not open this one either so I'm thinking that the idea that although it is an absolute option to physically in that sense behold it that the symbol that it holds for you in your consciousness is a focusing tool and paradoxically the very focusing tool that were you to actually physically seek it using it as a focusing meditation co-on in that sense will in that way begin your journey but there is not a physical necessity in that sense to hold it and see it you can already use it already exist so therefore you need not even in that sense purchase a shovel you can simply already use it I get like you're actually physically experienced that joy in that you can feel that by interacting with the symbol and if you are then so motivated and truly do feel that joy and motivation then you will in that sense get on the plane and do it thanks can I ask also it's interesting about the title of the book how do you feel about that title of which book the book that they're compiling on your sharing I am as you say to usual language it's Lee it would be simple enough for me to come up with a catchy title I do it all the time but this is your planet this is your tool it may be representative of ideas that I have but they've been communicated through your consciousness and therefore in that sense what you come up with will give you the feeling and understanding of satisfaction that you are truly part of this process and not simply in that sense a silent witness what is your idea for a title since you have brought it up I kind of like I don't know yeah all right I don't know I'll write you say what I'll write you a picture on this you will need to discuss that with a proper individual I do request from my end that my picture is not on the book the idea is that it would be if I had any request at home in the process to allow the concepts to stand on their own and not weigh them down with dogma weigh them down with symbols weigh them down with labels let the concepts float on their own I would like to share that I would call the plus be who you are be who you are what you are what you are what you're going to do is you'll be making a very creative experience that's my help I thank you as well right I'm done you did you didn't want your picture on the back side but this brought to mind we never did get a picture of your you know my I have in that sense many times describe myself the mere reason I said that again is to remove the idea of a symbol rather than someone buying a book purported to be transmitted by an ET simply by a book, open it and see if it resonates with who you are. It makes it much more of a pure statement and allows the concepts to not be tied down in the messenger. What I was about to say was Maui does draw pictures of, is it possible that you can communicate to her so she can draw a picture of you? Already done. Well you identified which one it is. Already known. Didn't tell me. Oh, right. Thank you very much. Come on. Come on. All right. Pimit. Hi. And who you're greasy. Oh, helpful one. Thank you. Question. No, I have two things to meet up. I want to tell you. All right. I had two instances of this. I was a little nervous. I was a little nervous. I was a little nervous. I was a little nervous. I was a little nervous. I was a little nervous. I was a little nervous. I was a little nervous. I had two instances of not alone to go. I was driving down the highway. And I thought I missed my exit because everything changed. And I started to go into the panic because everything changed. And then I stopped and I went wait a minute. Everything didn't change. I changed. Oh, always happens that way. And for my point of view of everything was different. And then it reverted back to getting off the right exit. I thought I'd complete it and be exit. Why have that happened to me a couple of times, which was really neat for me to validate myself because obviously the original assessment was panic and judgment. And then I stopped and said, oh, I did this. And that was okay. All right. So the idea of change initially may be in that sense of it intimidating. But once you resolve yourself to it, everything becomes comfortable and doable once again. And the next thing I'm going to talk about is the past week or so I've been experiencing the major panic concerning EP connection. Whatever for? I don't know. Normally when I would do when my fear would kick in on it, I would just stop a moment and say I choose love. Usually just this is a well, I've sort of been. Oh, why don't we just say something? Never have you had any kind of an experience that you would call extraterrestrial in nature, which is in any way fearful. Never in this life. Yes. I understand what you're saying. What you're saying. Well, I have never stated that to you before. Simply wanted to be clear about it. It's just that I was querying myself because now I was the past couple of days it was like perhaps what you are by the way perceiving and mislabeling as anxiety is the excitement over the idea that more people again will be becoming aware of our existence. Okay, I accept that. What did you do? That's easy to understand. Proceed. But what I really was, I would look at that and say, all right, I choose love but I don't want to know anything about this. And I've never done that before. I just felt like, wait a minute. I don't want to do that. I want to just say, or whatever it's worth. I know it's mine fear that's my belief and I don't want to put any denial into- May I make a suggestion? Yes. Now, it is up to you. Perhaps rather than saying I choose love, you can say I choose excitement. The reason being that excitement incorporates love to begin with. But it's more specific to these things which it is conducive for you to be doing and when you are doing, there isn't as much time to think of these things. Thank you. Oh, thank you. See you, ma'am. Okay, first I want to know do we- when we all dream or when we sleep at night, do all of us, does our consciousness go somewhere and work? Are we all engaged in- There are different experiences. Understand again that this entire reality exists within you. And when you so-called dream, you create other realities just as real in that sense as this one as to whether you perceive that you are working or playing in these realities that will be up to you. But they are valid experiences just as seemingly solid as this reality. The difference is that you fall asleep into that dream reality and you wake up into this dream reality. This dream reality has more of a sense of what you determined to be continuity and succession. That dream reality has less of a sequential order and more of what you call a spontaneous shifting tendency. Okay, so we don't all- all the time. We're not all of a system somewhere else in the- Well it can be as one of your functions that you may do that from time to time. But again you go nowhere. The reality moves around you, so to speak. I know I guess that. Oh, do you wish to ask more specifically rather than simply assume that you get it? Well just repeat the last statement you made about reality moving from- Okay, so we're not going anywhere, yes. You are not literally going anywhere but the realities that you create and experience are just as real as this. You really have different definitions, different timings, different meanings and as you shift your thinking the reality can shift so it is not as sequential as this reality. So if you could like measure where the consciousness or energy is going at night. You would perceive again the consciousness has gone nowhere and that the reality moved around it. Again this is quite arbitrary but that is more accurate. So if someone were working let's say like this woman in another galaxy or in a period you would not perceive her consciousness there. Well you absolutely might but the mechanism is not that she has gone there but created that here. Simply to be accurate about it. Okay and then I have a question about energy work and we talked once that I asked you about white light and people doing energy work telling me and they need to protect themselves in white light and you basically said we are protected anyway. I basically said that the need for protection is another way of stating that there is an underlying assumption of the likelihood of an attack. Okay so now I was doing energy work on someone and basically thought that I felt always in the light. No need to even think about protection. But as I was working on this person I started to pick up, I started to get very ill. I felt like I was going to pass out, I got very hot and then I felt like I was going to throw up. And I had to excuse myself from the energy work, go into my bathroom and basically stick my head in the toilet while I try to kind of breathe in I don't know. And basically feel that that was something energetic that transpired. Other stood but it was more you creating a sympathetic vibration to their energy rather than an actual transfer and since that is more technically what occurs. Each individual creates their own version of an energy and there is the aparency of a transfer. What you can do if you experience such a thing again rather than sticking your head in the so called toilet can be simply to take a series of slow and methodical deep breaths breathing in love and light and simply allowing anything else which is no longer relevant to you to be on its way calmly, slowly, easily. No gut wrenching toilet activity. So was that a real experience? I mean so that was a real experience. It was the experience of you being very sensitive and sympathizing to the vibration of the individual not a transfer of negative energy which is impossible. Okay so if I didn't, if I chose to do nothing not to breathe in and out and light and love to do nothing what could happen? A variety of things perhaps again you could have gotten what you call physically ill but the idea is that what you were feeling was not even so much your creation of that vibration. It was your resistance to your creation of that vibration and the breathing up puts you more in the allowance state less than the resistance state. You may understand whenever you feel increased heat in your body that that is a direct liberal translation of resistance which produces friction. What is being conscious? Resistant. In this case your own resistance to the energy you were creating and perhaps defining and labeling that you had received but in actuality has sympathetically created which can buy allowing you to breathe through it and allowing you to balance it, allow the other individuals to create their version of the balance and their experience may be that you suck negative energy out of them and replace it with positive but what they have done is literally allowed you to create your version of the negativity and handle it and then in being inspired by that create their version of the resolve. Wow. But your nothing is conscious. Well you can allow it to be conscious now that we are discussing it by all means. The response in that sense may appear to happen spontaneously. It may appear to be subconscious but you are engaged in a conscious process having an effect so you can also say it is conscious. And perhaps you can rebel when that happens get very excited something is happening. You are displaying increased sensitivity. Now if you judge yourself in the process you will increase the friction and resistance. If you simply allow yourself to transform it generally again the other individual will also create a version of that and there will be the aparency of a healing taking place. Actually what is occurring is they are following your lead and allowing themselves to heal themselves still giving away their power to you as an external symbol but ultimately still utilizing that power to create the healing. I understand it is tempting to think that you all exchange energy but it is simply not so. You create your version of energy which you then experience as a seeming exchange but you are all completely your own universe and so therefore there is nowhere to get energy from and put it to. The aparency of the exchange again is by your creating your own version of the energy then creating their own version of the energy. When you experience the aparency of the exchange of energy it is a very credible aparency. It can absolutely seem that an exchange has taken place but by allowing you to know that you are each creating your own energy I give you back your own power and realizing that the management of that energy is completely up to you. Okay you are familiar with the term smudging where they burn. You burn like sage or cedar, Indians used to do it to kind of get rid of negative energy and clear. Okay so healers generally will tell you to use the sage, use as much as they can clear the negative energy from the room. And when you like that you do so with the complete expectancy and expectation that such a thing will occur and so therefore you allow yourself to experience that aparency. But if you believe you don't need to do that then what you are saying is you don't need to do that. All tools are valid but they are simply you placing your power outside of yourself. Now you do it quite effectively. By all means you can use a tool even though you realize that it is a tool. Being most accurate though what you are saying is true you do not need the tool. You can do it in a variety of other ways as itself contains units. But I am not invalidating the use of tools simply calling a spade a spade, allowing you to see it is a tool. Allowing you to see the sage cannot clear the air in that sense because the air is already clear. Your version of the air may not be clear and that is what you have to interact with and transform. Well my fundamental belief goes against using tools. In the same way that I am discovering I believe that I don't need crystals. I don't need things that I can create them. By all means that is an empowered viewpoint but do understand that when you are interacting with other individuals it can often in that sense be more conducive to go through their path of police resistance. They may not be ready to hear what you are saying and if they are not ready to hear what you are saying you need not forsake them come back to me when you are ready to hear that you can play with the symbols and do so with the clear conscience because you understand what the symbols are. You are not misrepresenting the symbols. Does this make sense? Yeah. Is this for some reason disturbing? I ask because of the tone of your voice. Well let's say there is nobody in my house and they have gone and I don't use sage or smudge stick and the next person who comes and believes that I should have. So are you saying that for their sake? Well you can query them as to why they believe that and then you can decide whether you wish to in that sense use the tool to work with their belief system or explain to them another idea. It is up to you. It depends on your perception of their readiness to expand to more of an empowered idea. Individuals will cling to symbols and that does not necessarily make them disempowered. I guess I have a bit of doubt as to totally believing that what I believe is true. All right which is another way of saying you're trapped in what? In the fact that I could be wrong and there might be this little bit I'm overlooking where this little bit of stuff could. I don't have the power to really get rid of it on my own and it's true. I understand that and remind you that it is true and it isn't true. It is right. It is wrong. It is up to you. Everything that allows that little doubt to slip in there is your own decision and you can simply have your decisions be more intentional and be more definitive. I know all things are true you can say to yourself and here is what I am going to invest my focus in. Period. Thank you very much. I thank you as well. At this timing I wish to thank you all for your willingness to provide to me and members of my society an exciting option for the evening. We do not have what you call world series and so this will do for us. I thank you for your willingness to extend yourself and in that sense show us that much more about ourselves for as we tell you that existence and reality is contained within you. We also understand this to be true for ourselves and therefore to me you are all elaborate symbols of me and I thank you. I bid you a most fond and loving good evening.
