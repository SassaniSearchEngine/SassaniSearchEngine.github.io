 So right now, say before we continue with this interaction, I brief bit of information that may be of interest to some. For we do not do so often, but in this instance we have shall we say, keys to open. The circle that you have referred to in your England area, that are extraterrestrial in origin, are a if you haven't figured this already out yourself a code. The way to in a sense break in a sense the code is make note of chronologically what they look like, collect photographs and so forth. Again paying attention to the chronology of occurrence and shall we say several interesting things will make themselves apparent. For now, that is all. Shit. Thank you for that. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Just having a bit of fun. Thank you. If you have a question I would like to ask. Back to the big time when you said when we are doing what excited system time passes quickly, we age only that short time. Does that also work in reverse when we focus on time and feel like we spend a lot of time with the whole day when indeed only an hour has passed, have we also aged that whole day that we have to see. Yes. And various students, it does work in both directions. It is again your perception of the time and here it comes that you are creating for you create time. Not muklok. You create it. You create your experience of it and thereby its physiological seeming affects upon you. Therefore, yes. Thank you. That is why many individuals who do not do what excites them appear very old, very tired, very haggard. It is very tiring. It is very depleting to resist your own ecstasy. By not doing what excites you for whatever reason, you are resisting your own ecstasy. You are resisting who it is that you have chosen to be. Your excitement tells you what it is that you have created yourself to be. Very, really when you have for a sign, your excitement is that sign. It points you flawlessly in the proper direction to do the most with the least time and most effortlessly. Prostine. Thank you. My other question was on a matter of the loving things. When we sit down in new medication as we get them projecting the world peace and giving the earth, how does that help to change the consciousness and affect and bring around that world peace? Each and every one of you are a component, a constituent of what you label your math, consensus, reality, your math, consciousness. Therefore, that mass consciousness exists and empirically exists. Not a vague idea out there. When it is comprised, in a sense, the way we can convey it most clearly of the electromagnetic fluid or energy of your planet. So very, really, you do perceive that you existed empty space. No. You are swimming in a sense with an electromagnetic sea. This is how beings are able to communicate with each other through that conduit, through that fluid, and upon focusing your consciousness in any one direction. That sends out a literal ripple through that electromagnetic fluid. What of the few tools that we, in a sense, have given to your society is before you this evening of your time labeled the peace clock. What this pre-deposes is that every single day in your noon time for one minute, only one minute, surely, can stand up for world peace that you do reflect and ponder upon the idea of world peace, unconditional loving world peace. What this does for you have complexly set up your world. Feel that even your time, your clock time varies and you have what you label time zones. If it does create within that electromagnetic fluid, a movement around your globe every single day. Therefore, if many individuals will, for about one minute upon your noon time each day, meditate upon the idea of world peace, you will begin a momentum. You will begin, if you will, a current within that fluid, a peaceful, loving, unconditional current. Then you will have what you label, miracles upon your planet, the natural order of things. That's that answer the question. Yes, I'd also like to find out if that same theory works, not theory, but you get my guess. If that works on a person to person level in rejecting that unconditional love, how does that affect another person who makes you going for a transition that you're trying to assist them with? In an effect, what occurs? You cannot, in a sense, impose yourself upon the reality of an object, but you can set up a most conducive atmosphere, in a sense, electromagnetic bubble around an individual, which will allow them an opportunity to choose that reality more strongly. Again, you cannot force it upon them. You cannot change anyone but yourself. Because you can send out that love much in the way that we have spoke of being a true reflection to each individual of who you are without them having to change. That same sentiment in sending through the fluid, that sentiment can create again a conducive atmosphere. We'll recognize again though that the best way, in a sense, to change another individual will be only way, in a sense, to change another individual is to change yourself. And upon changing yourself, it will appear that everybody else has changed. In a sense, they have. You are now interacting with different aspects of the same individual, but you see through new eyes. You allow new inroads and outroads of communication and interaction with these individuals because you have changed your vibration. So again, start from within, it all begins with each and every individual. Does that also seem like you? Thank you. Thank you. But, my sh**, is... The Shark. Ah, I have two things. Number one. Number one. Let's get- I want to get back to the time situation thing, that we were talking about. You're in a moment and of course you're having a good time. An hour goes by but it seems like a minute there before you've only aged a minute. So if individuals, like many individuals, wear watches and are conscious of the time, you know, they have to be here, they have to be there looking at their watch. If a group of people just took their watches off and took the clocks off the wall and went about their daily life being in the moment, could there be a change on a mass scale? Yes. And in effect you may well view it from this perspective. Just not as much the idea of expedientially that your watch or your clock is keeping track of time. It is a tool that enables you to create. So, yes. So therefore then let's go back then to talking about the peace clock and we're talking about this 12 o'clock thing which I don't do because I don't look at clocks. I go according to when I'm sort of hungry and as my work throughout the day I'll find out glass of water or that sort of thing. So that, but if we take a look at everything as being all one thing and recognize as being in the moment that peace clock to me, at least, okay, this is from my perspective, from my point of view, is that if I'm thinking about peace at 11 o'clock and again at 1 o'clock, aren't we still working with all one thing? The idea is this. It is not so much that it is important to do it within a particular time. It is that you have created yourself as a society that exists within and utilize this timing on a regular basis. Therefore, this is to appeal in a mass sense to as many individuals as possible within what is already incorporated into their daily reality. But you may adapt this again as you have proved your imagination simply validated. Oh, yes, I have. Anytime it appeals to you, it will have the same effect. Your noon time can be any time. That's all right. That's okay. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. My second number two. Number two. In the aspect of being responsible for yourself and responsible, not for another person, but to another person. I want to bring that into the realm of dealing with my children on that schedule of getting up in the morning and getting them off to school and getting them to eat at least breakfast. I mean, what do you do when he sits down, a child sits down and just eats a piece of fruit so if I've had enough? Say, oh, all right. Let me ask you a question. Okay. Have you done so? Say, all right. Watch their eyes when you lose. You may find patterns. I have to talk to you many times they will eat more. There is more than just what issue of coming there, but you may allow them to function more within their own timing than you have. And then because of the way you have set up schedules, you have set up agreements that individuals make to go to a particular place at a particular time. That is also a consideration. See, because I am the consideration that my child in order to get through a busy day of school needs to have the nutrients. Oh, well, right. You know. So if that individual does not desire to eat, and you say, all right, and he goes to school and is hungry, do you think he will do it again tomorrow? And will that not be a stronger lesson than you saying no? Okay. Do you understand? Yeah. I mean, it is not really a battle. You know, many times, big children, parents do desire to experience for them, to make decisions for them based on their experience, where it is a situation of physical life, danger this may be most appropriate. However, we suggest that it is overdone. Otherwise. Yes. Okay. I understand that it is just that there are those particular times good shows that they are in the society where they are working very well in what they are doing, but there is also the aspect that I am getting up in the morning and making sure that they are dressed and so and so. So if I have one that takes an hour and a half, which he does, in order to come down to the breakfast table, which means getting dressed and making his bed, and he still late for the bus, I mean, I would not allow him to be that way, but I still come to the bottom of the stairs and say, come on, it is now ten after eight, you have ten minutes, come on, it is now twenty after eight. I mean, is this something where I should pull back? Is that being responsible for? In a sense that it is a balance, this is maybe an exception in a small sense of some of these ideas. But by easing up, by backing off to some degree on what you would consider the less critical issues and allowing that individual or any individual to experience the effects of their own choices, that by infusing slowly that idea will create a balance. Okay, so we are talking about sort of like doing it on a gradient. On a gradient would be a very good way to put it, easing them into it and easing yourself in a sense out of it. Which I feel that I have done on certain respects. Things tend to move more smoothly without the implication of those structures. Right, yes. Again, many times the issue is one of control, one of power, one of those ideas versus the actual, as you say, apple and the more. So by easing up, by lightening up on many of these ideas, that will not so much be a focus on an issue. And they will realize that your offerings to them are within unconditional love and not out of attempting to control them. For many of the rebellious aspects of your youth is due to this idea of feeling suppressed and needing to express. Does that help? Yes, that does help very much. Thank you. That is my shit. That's all. I have a number of questions. Oh, right. The last time I was here you answered my question about the ladies. Eight. About a ship that I had seen in a kid. And I have a further question about that. Are they still aware of, are they still keeping track of my growth potential as a person or as a human being? Eight. That are real in a real sense. Yes. There is an agreement being played out on their end on your end. But much of the initial communication that you will experience, if you allow it to happen, will begin in a sense on what you would perceive to be a mental level. And validating those inward communications will be a beginning place. Rosie? When will that be happening? I try to point you. Rosie, the idea of being do not invalidate what you get. Your willingness to not invalidate what comes in will determine the rate that it is sent. Your willingness to receive determines the rate of transmission from, in a sense, the other end. My other questions are, in the Middle East, you have deserts where the pyramids are. At one time in our history of the earth was there ever a civilization of advanced civilizations that had been there at one time. And were they destroyed at all? And how do those deserts there forever? Or were they just something that happened at some point to some catastrophic reason? It is our perception from what you are not in that region as much as you say, under water. Number one. Eight. What do the true built pyramids there at that particular period of time? A history of our planet? Do you mean the idea of the only Egyptian pyramid? The Egyptians. However, not utilizing the pure technology that had fallen before them, they used much more of the idea of mechanical means toward constructing those structures where earlier pyramids, that in a sense are no longer existing upon your planet or have not been found, shall we say? Were created by a different means, one of them being, and this may interest you, the sonic levitation, the sonic nullification of the gravitic or gravity field in a sense of orchestration into place of these structures. However, when your Egyptian civilization did shall we say come of age, there was only remnant information shall we say from what you label your continent of Atlantis, and in a sense it got altered the actual reason or use for the pyramid structure of a four-sided pyramid with a square base. It is in a sense for a meditative experience you have labeled astral projection by sitting in a particular place within it. One-third approximately from the top of that structure, the shape and orientation of that particular type of structure acts as a lens for electromagnetism, in such a way to allow an individual to tap into that idea. When it became Egyptian, I so to speak, the idea was all-third that if one could leave their body by of this that they could maintain their consciousness after death, but this was not exactly the original idea. Okay, that question, I have a few more questions popping in my head here. Oh, right, pop away! I was thinking about teleportation. Is it possible for a person to teleport to another place? Eight. Instantaneously. Instantaneously. Eight. How does it go about that process of teleportation? Simply by redefining the vibration that corresponds to your position and believing beyond the shadow of a doubt that such a thing is possible. Okay, my final question, I have nothing to do with any of the others, but I've come up with an idea, I want you to tell me whether it's possible to design a toilet that, and it's sort of funny when you think about it, but it really helps the environment to destroy or to disintegrate waste without destroying the planet. Oh, right. I recognize that human waste does not in any way shape or form destroy, the planet, and in a sense it's part of a cycle. Okay, but on a larger scale, you see, not just for human waste, but for all kinds of waste that do destroy chemicals and so forth that have... Very good, that would be quite a feat. Could you explain the idea of the technology? It's based on basically a laser beam, but I have not really completely figured out what kind of laser beam is possible to do something like that. All right, the idea is you may polarize certain substance via the use of waste. One of the propensities we see within your society, but we cannot be too specific or thus specific for the technology does not presently exist upon your planet, for shall we say the containment storage of waste, which you may consider radioactive waste and so forth, will be accomplished by a particular type of biologically oriented, using similar structural ideas from what you label your RNA structure, your DNA structure, to build in a sense form, in a sense grow a power model type structure that acts as a matrix, a filtration matrix, so that a particle of shall we say waste material will pass through it, but be polarized in a way that you have not yet seen, so that it will be in a sense pollution of another type, but not exactly the type of hazardous pollution. So therefore you could, in a very real sense, use light or lasers for the same idea that it creates. I'm going to still work out, I'm still working on it, and I did get a touch with somebody in Washington who was interested, they take inventions, and they have a thing where you copyright, we call copyright prevention so that no one else can take any mention from you, and I just did this. So I designed, I've drawn it up, they say it doesn't have to be perfect, but it's sensitive and they will have people with it. Alright. So that's what my next step will do. Very good. Simply put it into the action mode, and you will get a result. On the idea of building your own spacecraft that is possible for you, we shall explain briefly the idea of how hours, spacecraft, do function for it, it has been understood and speculated that traveling, great distances would be quite impractical. For you have labels that there is a barrier of the speed of light that you cannot go beyond, and that is not quite fast enough, shall we say, for you to get anywhere of significance within your lifetime. Our mechanisms bypass this idea entirely with a simple realization, and we will share this with you now. You have considered that an object resides in space, that an object resides in time. No, it can, you may proceed it that way, but it is more that you can perceive the reality that time and space are properties of an object. Object A and object B may work identical. They are not our own. For object A possesses location A. That is A part and intergroup part of the vibration of that object. Object B possesses maybe exactly as a far-out of work for the same material. However, a different location, thereby by definition, a different object. Therefore, location and timing are properties of an object. You are energy, are vibration. In general, by isolating the portion of your vibration without changing anything else that corresponds simply to the positional vibration. By isolating, creating an isolation field around an object that isolates out that one aspect of vibration and simply plugging in the vibration of the new location. The object instantaneously then resides at the new location by simply changing that one aspect of the vibration. This is how our ships do, in a sense, move. They do not actually move. The universe moves around them. As what happens is, we set up around our craft isolation field. We unplug old location, location A. We then plug in desired location, location B, and we are instantaneously then at location B. Irrespective, as you say, uptime, irrespective of, as you say, upspy. Therefore, allow that to roll around with it. Do you have another question? This is one final one that popped in as you thought. Oh, right. There's a place called Pine Bush, New York. I went to a conference about a year or two ago dealing with UFOs as we call it. Thank you very much. This one I spoke to said that she's not there. In Pine Bush, New York, they have many sightings every time of the week. A spacecraft of different shapes, different sizes, and that there must be some sort of a base there somewhere of a civilization of people from either here or elsewhere in the mountains there. Is that true? In our perspective of what you are speaking, not exactly, but there are certain areas, shall we say, because of their low population, which is generally where one will do a fly by, that have a tendency, shall we say, to have many sightings. We understand that you desire to facilitate your communications with the civilizations you are contacting with, maybe wait, wait, maybe we make one additional suggestion in addition to the one we made last session of your time. That being, you will have a greater tendency, shall we say, to view such events when you are in a remote area alone, all right? Yes. Again, that will make it more conducive for that type of interaction. Not that it cannot happen otherwise. It is just shall we say not as common for various and specific reasons. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. When you are sharing. Sharing. Yes, the shark. I would like to ask a question about the pyramid. All right. Is there a function of the difference between one that is four sizes and a square base and one that is three sizes and a triangle? Eight. And would the index be in the system that we made? We have a label that the order pyramid on one that focus electoral magnetic energy for now and we may expand upon this in the future. Shall we say they simply focus it in a different manner? They still perform essentially the same. Essentially, as we said, the four sided variety may be in a sense used for projection of consciousness, which we have explained is a misnomer. A three sided period of age, a tetrahedron. The fundamental volumetric shape in your reality, the first shape that presents with volume is what we label a template shape. For various reasons, we shall stop there. Do you have another question? Yes, I do. During the course of working this week, I found myself in contact with a chemical that was quite toxic. I had to work within a building where this chemical was. I was now excused to use the word try at the moment, trying to set up a barrier, a psychic barrier to... All right. One moment before you proceed. Recognize the need for protection. Generally, it has behind it a belief that there is something to be protected from. Relax. If it is not your vibration, your intention, it will not find you. All I was wondering is that all I need to do or think in order to work in a situation like that, if I find myself in it again? Can you define, as you say, the name or the label of that chemical? No, I really don't. I don't know what the name is going to look like. How do you know it is there? It was an insecticide that was used to kill insects in a greenhouse. So I know it was there mainly because I know that it was used in the house the night before and I could smell it. All right. Simply relax. If you feel like you must air out once an alarm. But do not again set up an elaborate, protective consciousness. Four, in general, when one does set up an elaborate protection mechanism, one is also setting up the attack. Do you understand? I certainly do. Relax. Breathe outside. And allow yourself to align. Nothing can attack you unless you are afraid for fear is simply feeling that something is most likely. Allow it to release. If you feel fear about it, simply allow that to be an opportunity to determine what you still must be believing in order to fear and transform that belief which no longer serves you. All right. Thank you very much. Want to go into the next one? Shit! I'm sorry. Oh, one moment. We choose in these interactions to point out to individuals that ways that you word things are very indicative of the effects that they have upon you. Therefore, within these communications, we ask that you do not use the word problem and simply sit you and excuse me, simply substitute the idea of a situation which I have not allowed to transform, proceed. Okay. Well, there's a situation and there's lots of negative forces involved and I was wondering if you could comment on this. Define. Well, I'm wondering if my family is in any, you know, any harm. From? From these negative forces that are surrounding. Can you be more specific as to what the negative forces are? How you have become aware of them? Um... There's just things that this man was a really good man and just took a total turn and there's just, you know, unsure of things that are happening. It's hard for me to find. All right. We understand one moment. Do you feel in danger? Sometimes, when certain things happen, but I'm not sure there's people around me who feel that I may be in danger. Do you feel in danger? Not right now. No more. Do you feel subject to these negative forces? At times. Are you in a position to transform your current situation? As far as you can tell. No. One moment. Are you being a true reflection of who you are within this situation? Are you expressing how you feel? Yes. What is the result of that expression? Lots of hatred. From? From my husband. Are you currently, as you say, upon your planet, co-habitating? Um, to find it. Living in the same dwelling? No. All right. Are you, as you say, sharing custody? Of children? Yes. I have the custody of the children. We are not sure. We are dealing in on the nature of the question. Can you be more specific? Um. You let amongst friends. Not right now, just because, um, you know, it's my first time here. Oh, it's over. It's over. Thank you. I think it'd be a pleasure. However, again, when you can communicate more fully with us, we do wish to address this idea. But when there is a vagueness and a question, that is all in a sense we have to work with. Because of the removal of how these communications stay placed, I am not speaking directly to you. That is, shall we say, a middle man. Therefore, many things that I would may be able to pick up are, and comment upon are not available due to the inability to communicate in this fashion right now. However, again, an overall generalized idea is keep your eyes open. Be aware of what has happened, and act according to your integrity, doing what you feel you must do without hesitation. Realize that you are in a situation where the agreements have been made. Individuals never co-interact without having on some other level as you create level agreements. This does not mean they have to play out in a negative fashion. There is the idea you label it in your society of karma. We have explained that karma itself in pose. But the one is ready to allow and accept and realize this idea. They are, in a sense, binding themselves to karma. Karma does not have to play out for tap. It may play out by balancing energy all the way. So, again, keep your eyes open. Do not hesitate when you feel. Do not put on what you label in your society blinders. All right? Thank you very much. Shannon? Mr. Shar? I have two questions. The first has to do with the dinosaur. Our scientists more and more of these days are giving stronger support to the theory that the reason the dinosaur disappeared from planet Earth is that a huge, meteorite, meteorite, hit the Earth and then change the climate drastically which caused the dinosaurs to die. Can you comment on that? Yes, that is not our perspective on the matter. That is not our perception of what has happened. It is simply that that was an exploration of a particular type of physicalized focus that had played out its scenario and played out its purposes. And therefore, transform, move on. That is all. There is just sort of an evolutionary disappearance. In a sense, although we are hesitant to use the word evolutionary. Shall we say, purposes were served? Entities moved on to other types of experience. I see. Thank you. Second question. Eight. And the two younger ones are identical twin daughters who were 30 years old yesterday. But anyway, as you well know, compared to for a thermal twin where there are two separate identical twins for some reason unknown, I guess to us. One egg decides to split. So each of my twin daughters has exactly the same genes and chromosomes, the same heredity. Can you comment generally on the significance of identical twins versus for thermal twins? And then if I can ask you one specific question. Alright. The idea is very much this. We are able that you are in a sense considering yourself to be reincarnational beings. From our perspective, however, it is multiple simultaneous incarnations. Very many times, individuals will incarnate as more than one being in the same contemporary lifestyle and we have labeled that counter parts. Identical twins for the most part, there are all exceptions but not in this case, are counterpart consciousness. That have decided to experience, in a sense, very real sense, similar ideas with slightly different nuances in the same period of time. The eternal twins can be either, but generally are two different ideas. Am I hearing you say that my specific twin daughters appear to be counterpart? Eight. They are sort of different for example. That is the idea of the exploration. Rather than one person having vast swings in personality. Eight, in a sense, higher self will incarnate as two different individuals and simultaneously do both. Exploring different avenues. Eight. For example. With similar vehicles. Okay, the one twin got married in August and the other twin sees herself as gay. Oh, right. That very well may be one of the primary reasons for the separation. The allowance of both without either interfering with your... But our both is either one a complete person. Gay! Okay. As in every individual. And then when in a sense you merge again, this is colloquial, you never separate. For you say, except for your perception of separation. You then have the knowledge of both of all. I don't know. When they both die. Eight. Is there going to be some rejoining or connection that's... Eight. That is what we have said. I'll think about that. Thank you very much. There will be but a few moments left to this introduction. Shouting. Yes, Bishar. Eight. Back to the question of the travel with your state craft. Is that essential what you say is a key serialization and a leading serialization? In a sense you may label it as such, yes. The navigational system of our craft, however, is not controlled by control panels. The reason that we are able to do this is that the navigational system of our craft is linked to the mentality of the pilot. In other words, it is specific craft. Thank you very much. Shouting. Bishar. Eight. In the subject of power and control, I'm getting the idea that in a way it's bad to try to have power and control people who control them, but sometimes it's essential in the workplace. And I'm having a problem controlling the person I work with which makes my job difficult. All right. In the parameters of those situations, there are certain understood agreements. I have taken this job within these parameters. These are my responsibilities. Therefore, if they are not met, that is in the way you have created your society. Or you are not talking judgment as to whether we agree or disagree. But in a sense, if you don't play, you're out. Right, but I still want to play. I want to make it happen like you say, the way that would excite me. And I'm trying to... Can you, as you say, define the nature of the specific difficulties? Yes, I'm in the talking business, and I like to deliver certain things a certain way. And I'm no longer given the ability to choose where to go and when to do it. And I try to get that ability back without basically stepping on any toes. But it seems as though I have to insist that I'm going to have to do it or I'm going to leave. I don't want to have to go that route. And I'm wondering if I did do that, would I be making a positive step or a negative step? Are you doing in your life what excites you the most? Yes. That is your idea of trucking? Basically, trucking is just the way I'm supporting my family and living life. How would I? What does excite you the most? Just experiencing life. We suggest that this be the place that you start with these explorations by determining, by receiving, by sitting down and being very honest with yourself about what excites you the most. Not the results of that, but what excites you the most to do. You will establish that there is something else that you can be doing that is more truly reflective of who you are. When you then line yourself up with that idea, the difficulties will simply have been the most will simply have been the vehicle to allow you to transform away from a situation you didn't prefer to a situation that you do. But you must establish, be honest with yourself what excites you before you can then begin to decide what steps are available to you to do it. Do you understand? Yes, I do. Then often, what excites an individual the most is, as you say, a job upon your planet. If it is not recognized that all jobs were not always existing, some individual was excited about doing a particular thing and created that job. If you are doing what excites you the most for a living, as you say, then you are not truly working for a living, for it is no work. It is no effort to do what excites you the most. When you are able to effortlessly do something being the best you you can be, it becomes an abundant situation. It will continue to support you. The universe does not toss you a one-sided coin. What excites you can support you. It is simply your willingness to do what excites you versus what you feel you must do in order to have the money to do what excites you. Do you understand? Yes, basically I am trying to deal with something at work and you are saying that it is just more or less not concentrated on that and concentrated on what excites me at home or in my life. Basically what we are saying is that there is a situation that you do not prefer within your life rather than remaining. Fixated upon what you do not prefer, swing your attention to what you do prefer. When you begin to do what you do prefer, you will find it to be supportive and you will see why you have swung away from what you did not prefer. Easy will be to give you the opportunity to look at options and it is no coincidence, no accident I should say, that it has timed out in this way. If something suddenly happens that you do not expect, it is not necessarily a block in your past. It is something that you must know coming in an unexpected way. So it is showing you that now is the time, the timing, the most conducive timing to establish what does excite you and begin to do that. Thank you very much. It is very close to what I need to hear. Thank you very much. Hey, this is the 10th anniversary of the death of John Lennon. Oh right. Can you comment on his reincarnation or have a spiritual transformation? Hey, as far as that idea of that individual, he has not as a yet reincarnated in the sense that you are speaking. One of the reasons being because of the tremendous generation of power and love for that individual from all individuals or many individuals around your planet. It is energizing in a sense his consciousness is accelerating his consciousness, integrating his consciousness in such a way where he is in a sense being of service co-opially speaking from that end with the peace process, which is his main symbol. Does that help? Yes, thank you. Thank you very much. At this time we wish to express our love and appreciation to you for the unwillingness to share who you are. Simply go forth and do what excites you the most within integrity and you will see the results of which we speak. We never do insist that you do believe what we are saying because we are saying. To simply that if you do what we say, you will get the results. They most fond and loving. Good evening.
