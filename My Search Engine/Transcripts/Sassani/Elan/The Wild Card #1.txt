 I'll say Greek is the evening of your time as you create time. How are you? All right. All right. Allow me to begin by expressing my unconditionally loved in gratitude for your willingness to participate in this interaction with you. Understand from our perspective there are no accidents. And it is from our perspective, from our end being that these interactions have grown quite a bit. A specific pleasure for us to interact in perhaps what you might label a more intimate setting. So, therefore, we thank those of that good in that sense, choose to participate, for it allows us to be a little bit more specific, a little bit more intimate. All we proceed through the interaction, allow us to discuss briefly one of the aspects of ownership of your reality. For understand that because you do create your reality, create your life, you are, therefore, by extension, an owner, so to speak, of that life, of that reality. And the sooner that individuals get a grasp of this and begin to act in that sense, like an owner, the sooner they get the results they say they desire. So therefore allow us to introduce something. It may appear to you to not be new, but understand again that that in and of itself is a perspective. Our willingness to approach all situations as if anew allows you to experience them as fresh as anew. So therefore, though you may have heard this concept before, we suggest that you turn your ears slightly differently so that perhaps you can again discover it for the first time. And what we will simply present to you is a phrase, perhaps if you wish, you can entitle that phrase and perhaps this interaction, the wild card. For understand that even in your own society, in your game of cards, there is a particular designated card or card that if they come up in a sense, allow you to perhaps progress or jump or perhaps achieve your ends a bit more quickly, for it is a very variable symbol. And therefore, shall we say carrying around a wild card in your pocket may enable you in that sense to act as an owner of your reality in the instances where perhaps you are not doing so all the time. So allow us to first speak the phrase again, listen with new ears, but understand that no matter in what situation that you are in in your life, that this perspective will always align you with your purpose. And it will in even the asking of the question, have you acting like an owner for if you are an owner of your reality and acting that way, there is nothing within it that is extraneous. If something is created and you are the owner of the reality, obviously you must have created it. If you act like an owner, thereby you can use all your creations if you deny even one, at least for that moment, you are not acting like an owner, you still own it, but you are not acting that way. So understand the simple phrase, how does this serve me? That's only happening. Only the way it is, is such a wild planet. And understand, you are progressing in many of the ideas that we discuss in taking back your power. And we are not sharing this with you to reiterate and allow you to redundantly use it where it already has been applied now. We are now speaking about using all your creations in this way, including what you label fear, including what you label anger, and including what you label frustration for understanding. Fear is believing a reality that you do not prefer is most likely. It is the same belief as saying to the universe that you believe that something you do not prefer is most likely. And obviously by extension, this is not the statement or the perspective of an owner. For if you truly own the reality, there is nothing that can slip in there and get you. And if you feel fear in this regard, then you can use it, but not by pushing it away, not by denying it, by asking yourself, how does it serve me exactly as it is? What does it allow me to see about who I am? What does it allow me to understand about the degree to which I believe that I create my own reality? So the first application for the utilization of the statement, how does this serve me exactly as it is would be when you feel fear. It also allow us to share that when you feel it, what will enable you to use it most fully is allowing yourself to feel it. You own the reality. You created the fear. If you believe you created it for a reason, guide into it. Use it. If you deny it, then you do not believe you own it. Then you believe it is extraneous and are not acting like an owner. So first and foremost, when you believe that something that you do not prefer is most likely, allow that opportunity to view your belief and to change perhaps the ones that you feel limit you in this way. For if you are honest with yourself and allow yourself to truly feel the fear, it will simply when you ask it in that way, provide the proper perspective to allow you to answer it. And your willingness to feel it rather than squash it, allows the emotion itself to play out. When you finally decide, all right, all right, all right, I am fearful. I will not deny this. I will feel this fear. I will really feel it and allow yourself to permeate your being with the feeling. You generally get to the point where, okay, now what? And therefore you have used the emotion. And when you are at the precipice of now what, you can pull out that wrong card, polish it off, dust it off, and ask yourself the question and allow yourself to be honest about where your limiting beliefs lie. For as you read them out one by one, only then can you change them. So fear in that sense is one example we received a while. Second example, anger. We have defined anger before as a rush, a complete and entire rush of alignment that simply tells you, presented with a particular perspective or reality, how you stand. This is me. This absolutely is not. That is a symbol for that is self definition, self exploration. And by knowing what is not you, you have a firmer grasp of what is now the true anger that alignment only lacks and to 15 of your second. And perhaps some of you, if not all, can relate to the fact that when you create what you call anger, it generally seems to last quite a bit longer. From the 10 to 15 second point onward, however, it is no longer that rush of alignment. It only takes that rush of alignment 10 to 15 seconds. Once you have defined yourself, most individuals will then go to the step of invalidating the thing they don't prefer, or that is not representative of who they are. Other than simply saying, this is me, this is not the thing that is me is okay. The thing that is not is okay as well, though not for me. Individuals generally say, this is me, this is okay. This is not me. Get out of here. You think. And this perspective denies the validity of your exploration and denies the usefulness of how you have just defined yourself. So when you have in that sense aligned, you can ask yourself, how does this serve me exactly as it is? And perhaps in this instance, it serves you by allowing you the opportunity to have at the own right to experience that rush of alignment and not find it necessary to continue or progress that rush of alignment into judgment, into invalidation, for the judgment and invalidation, though you sense you are rendering it to someone else or an external situation, can only be expressed by you to the degree that you can pay it as an option. So if you are willing in that sense to judge and invalidate things which you do not prefer, you are most definitely also judging and invalidating the things within yourself that you do not prefer, meaning that you are judging yourself a high degree of the time. And you cannot express unconditional love and self-judgment at the same time. By definition, the moment you judge, the moment you say things are of unequal weight, one thing has more relative significance to another than you cut yourself off from choosing it as an option. So therefore, it is always through your advantage to allow the equalization of all of these ideas. And utilizing them in positive service simply then allows you to transform the effect of your anger to a positive result. Yes, I did say that. You can actually get angry and only have a positive experience if you allow the 10 to 15 seconds of the alignment of anger to serve you and then not go to the extent of invalidating what is not representative of who you are. So therefore, the wildcard function in full swing in this example. Now let's now discuss what you sometimes call frustration or boredom. For the purposes of this discussion, frustration can simply be defined as an emotion that arises from an individual's unwillingness to be in a given moment. When you are in a given moment, you are very wide-eyed and looking around at what is available in that moment. When however, you project that there is something better out there that is not available and you read it at that you create a corresponding emotion you call frustration. You can allow that to serve you by using it as a sign that you are not in that moment, grounding yourself to that moment. Now we are not saying that you cannot have goals and that you cannot have things that are exciting to you which you may not be able to act upon and therefore they are kept from you. No. As we have shared many times the things that you are excited about that you cannot act upon will eventually be option to act upon. But what allows that to happen most quickly is the acknowledgement of what you can act upon in a given moment. Therefore that does not then utilize the thing that is not available as a distraction. And when you get down to the business of living within each given moment only looking at what is available you do not create frustration. For there is always something to act upon and from the choices always one or more will stand out as more exciting than the others within your integrity. So you can use frustration to re-ground yourself to the moment. You can allow it to be of service to you exactly as it is by allowing it to point out to you that in that given moment you are in a sense utilizing your consciousness in a way which does not serve you toward moving in that moment. When you do factor out what you cannot act upon and allow yourself to more clearly see what you can act upon choose from those choices with your excitement you begin a momentum for there are results to the doing of the exciting things and those results bring along interlaced within them new options new opportunities that would not have necessarily been there. And the following of those options as they become available in each given moment paradoxically allows you to go toward the thing you say you wish to do that is not available right now most quickly for though that thing seems unrelated to perhaps taking a walk in a given moment for that is the most exciting thing. The taking of the walk and the most exciting thing are different facets of one expression and what tells you this is the fact that they both excite you that excitement commonality that thread of commonality of the excitement is what tells you it is related and will in fact get you to where you say you wish to be most quickly but not at the cost of living in this moment having a good time in this moment and each moment forward for as you generate the momentum of honoring your excitement with the integrity and choosing from what is available both by realizing that your excitement is your sign that of what is available that one is most closely aligned to who you are you generate a new momentum and the new momentum by definition replaces the old momentum and the results of the new momentum being that it is acting according to preference with integrity the results are preferential results with built in integrity. So therefore though we have chosen to highlight those three particular limiting interpretation fear anger and frustration being that it is a wild card that can simply be used in any situation any time you feel there is something in your life which does not belong saying that does not belong does not allow you access toward using it does not allow it to be serviced to you but when you say how does this serve me and not only how does this serve me but how does it serve me exactly the way it is not if it was only a little bit this or that exactly the way it is you are now using your creations to your fullest ability and when you allow your creations that come up in as negative to serve you to deliver the message that you created them being the owner of your reality to deliver they then transform and change their face and this is most applicable in situations that you call in your life repetitive negative happening or something keeps happening or seemingly keeps happening it is always anew but if you are interpreting it because it is very similar to the last time you can understand again that nothing is extraneous nothing is extra and even that particular idea can be used in a positive way all of it there are no exceptions whatsoever none therefore allow us to ask you now how may we be of service to you exactly as we are today. The last time I talked to you about some fruits that my dad had seen the snow of a no-knock at Maine and I went up to visit him to Queen now and then he showed me the pictures of the actual things that he had taken and they were small round circles about three inches with a hollowed out depression in the middle and there were 16 radiating little spikes around the outside and you told me you thought they were a reconnaissance investigation of some sort of way right now. They were a clock and the purpose of the particular landing was reconnaissance. Could you tell me so I could tell him who they are what they might have been and where they were from? Well most obviously they are extra terrestrial in terms of a particular label our suggestion would be that if he is interested in the subject to begin to extract the literature that is available on your planet for our providing of a rigid label at this time in his instance would perhaps narrow his thinking and not allow him to fully in that sense explore it. So if you find that he is willing to explore it and will come to some degree of realization by himself from what is available then we will be willing to expand upon it. Well the word that they had stuck in my notes was that you had said it was a space probe and I didn't know if that meant a machine or a physical beam or an epsilon or a balloon of sense you can understand that the craft in and of itself was uninhabited but came from a larger inhabited class. And another session that I would do with you by myself we were talking about the quick first that I heard all around my bed in my room at night or whatever and I was very terrified and you said to me at the time that's probably why they could start trying to connect with you and I felt very bad about that because I felt like you're somebody trying to make contact with me that I probably decided to do in this lifetime and here I am being so fearful that they can't do this and I just wondered who I was. Well the time we did not tell you so that you would feel bad but the idea is that there is a willingness on their end to honor so as not to seem to intrude upon you so therefore they will match you and if you in a sense withdraw so will they but there are no hard feelings. Can you tell me who they are or where they're from? What is your particular perspective if you are willing to share it then again we will expect it. All I know is that since that discussion I hide with you I decided that the only way I can allow something like this to make contact with them is if I can love myself more and open up inside me because it seemed like a loving feeling when I think back on it even though I was terrifying it was well you understand. We have discussed and again it is no accident that here in and of itself is believing that something you don't prefer is most likely so perhaps you can begin to use the situation to nail down why you felt in a situation that felt loving that something would occur that was not according to preference and you may merely find now wanting it through your belief system anew that that simply no longer applies and you can test it then out by inviting the contact once again and then shall we say monitoring to see whether your reaction is still fearful. But if you find that it is you will still have the same option to say not now. So our strongest suggestion would be to ask being that you have founded a significant question and there is no I don't carry out simply the expression of who you are and what you wish to explore that you asked them. I have one last question for now about my sister Holly who lives in Maine within the last 10 years she's the human to have some remembrances of being detained aboard a spaceship being examined on the table and after seeing the movie the importers the other night I just wondered if you had any sensing as to what would it be the data or who might entertain it would be that particular realm that particular stream yes. Understand that there will be many such in a sense you can say light bulbs popping on. One of the reasons for that particular shall we say multimedia event was on some level for at least some individuals the dissemination of this information in a way that will allow other individuals who are participating directly in the detainment scenario to begin to realize that it is all right to have this happen and that there are others as well some of who have integrated the experience. So again purposes of allowing her to explore with an open mind we will not say anymore but you can understand that that is the same source yet. Are they trying to mingle with us to start a new society or there are many purposes for the interactions that in a sense you can say is one. Okay. There is in their particular society. All right. What you label replicative fading what this is in your colloquial language is that for quite some time they began to reproduce by what you would perhaps call though not exactly but it will do artificial means and by doing so therefore lost the strength so to speak of their strain as they over and over again utilize similar genetic material. So one of the reasons for the interaction is to allow a viable shall we say strain to be introduced for the perpetuation of their race in a sense which is in danger so to speak of existence. This is the season of daily. Again that is the way. Can I ask you one last quick question about the dream. Ever since I was a little girl out of my dreams I have been running and running and I am very fearful and I am running away in times of warring people. But before you proceed you are all the characters in your dreams so perhaps you can ask yourself what are you running from inside yourself. From that perspective rather than interjecting or introducing an external source chasing you you may now have a different point of view to analyze that idea. So something comes to mind right now. That is a wonderful suggestion because I was wondering if my next follow up part of this question when you are dreaming something how do you know like say you are dreaming you are born a patient. So I am just asking you if you are just your higher consciousness trying to work it out for you like you just said to me running away from myself you know what am I running from. How do you know like real and what something that you are just making up to reflect your own feeling. Well the idea is that it is both and it is both within this reality as well. Or as you perceive other individuals as other individuals they exist within your consciousness and our reflections directly of you. So it is not this or that it is both but understand again from our perspective working dream reality what you consider to be this reality and sweeping dream reality both still fall under the category of reality. So therefore they are all reality no less real in any way than this one but the rules the parameters the boundaries are different the agreement are different. So in that particular reality you are more cognizant of the fact that it is all an extension of you but at the same time you can play a game so to speak of visiting with others and other consciousness. When you create a dream so to speak of being upon a craft understand you are a board a craft. And the experience that sometimes that will be the only way that you will allow yourself to perceive it. And the experience that you explained to me about Sedoma the last time I caught you that you thought it was a co-created experience that wonderful love that I felt that that means from the extra trust and myself not just something I was creating in my own mind. Again it is both but in the way that you mean yes and is also related to the whispering. If I could use all my creations and figure this out. Well there are no shows but if you get doing it you will get a positive result I guarantee it. Thank you very much. Oh thank you. Hello. Hey. Please friend. As we... While on the subject I have a good friend Helen who is something of a closet's abgot tea if that's possible. Recently she was beamed up to a craft and examined by a woman with some kind of a frequency instrument. And Helen said that she felt her skin tingling as it were. I am curious as to what this instrument was. Is what was she testing for? Well you know what he told me. It was a frequency analyzation device. We have discussed many times that though you consider yourself to be solid that you are simply denser forms of energy. Rather than energy even your scientists understand our one thing. Different expressions, different densifications of the same. One thing. Therefore because energy in a sense is the source of forces it can be quote unquote measured in many aspects according to frequency. Therefore the tingling in a sense was the sensing of the reading of the vibration itself. That is how they are able in that sense to again this is loosely speaking quote unquote as you have shared beam someone up. There must be familiar with aspects, nuances, subtleties of the vibration to be able to only affect the portion of the vibration of an individual that corresponds to their position in space and time without in a sense shall we say tampering with the rest. And as you grow, as you change, as you even get a new idea your vibration changes. It is constantly changing. There is a portion of it which you may say so to speak remains the same. This is what we refer to as your signature vibration. This is what identifies you as an individual but shall we say wrap the round that signature vibration is an ever variable vibration and that will change and perhaps need to be monitored, rechept and so forth. Well okay the examiner also said to Helen I see you are on diet number five. Could you tell us about this diet? No, not. Okay. Then another one. You understand that when individuals from North society deal with extra-terrestrial, the interactions, the extra-terrestrials themselves are as mirrors. So therefore what you put out is literally what you get back from the interaction. Therefore if you put in any degree of fear, you generally get back fear and fear is judgment so generally may be accompanied by pain, emotional, physical, spiritual pain. But the pain is in the judging, in the assigning of meaning and not from the interactions themselves. Okay. Then in to shift time of it in 1943, August the USS Eldridge. No comment. No comment on that? Not now. Okay. Perhaps there is something in your present reality we can discuss. Yes indeed. There are many things. I believe we are in the process of seeing the Orion and the plating and civilizations come together. I feel that I... Some encounters in dream state, in meditation state also interchanges such as our own materials that I have become acquainted with through a variety of different sources. It certainly has the ring of truth to me. I believe that there is an agenda for the coming together. And bit by bit I am seeing pieces that are glimmering. Perhaps you could speak about this agenda a bit more. Not really. The idea is you in a sense are tapping in and creating it. Allow yourself to access that same source that is not our particular focus. Though we understand perhaps the overall generalized blending of the energies, the specifics that you speak of are not apparent to us. So therefore have some fun. Well alright. Thank you. And I have one further question. Oh, then we will proceed to another and perhaps come back to you. Okay. Proceed. At the time when an ancestral civilization split into the Orion and plated in, what was it the strong attraction of the Orion option? First of all, it is not our perspective that such a split in that sense necessarily occurs. Understand, all creations, all explorations are valid. They are all literally equal in the eyes of God or all that is. Everything is within all that is or God. That is why we call it all that is. There is nothing that is outside. Therefore since everything is an expression of all that is or God, everything has been equal value. Now it has and understand this very carefully relative significance to a particular point of view. But from the overall perhaps you can say eyes of God, all is equal, all is unconditionally loved. Proceed. Well, okay. I am not sure that it addresses the question. You say you do not perceive that a split actually occurs. The idea, thank you, that it was a bit of a defocusing. The idea is that there is nothing any worse about the Orion exploration. And underlying in your question itself is the supposition that why would anybody want to do that? And that is not looking at all expressions as equal. Now you personally may not wish to, but understand that other consciousness has the right and the reason to explore that for that as a valid creation as well. The asking of the question pre-assumes an inequality and experience. That is more the experience of negativity, but that is an option as well. Well, you know, it seems to me that, I wasn't approaching it with that supposition actually, but out of- In the wording of the question, why would someone want to do that is the underlying feeling that why would anybody want to? And what we are saying is because it is a valid exploration, which perhaps has less significance obviously to you at this time than to those part taking directly in it. Plus exploring that degree of negativity also has being that there is a rubber band effect. The more negativity in that sense you explore when you let go the farther and faster and flings into positivity, that there will also be perhaps you can say a very positive result that they will also explore. Does that help a bit more? Yes, that helps a lot. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Good evening. Good evening. I have a few questions. One person that is not here from Southbury, her name is Henrietta, and she asked me to ask a question about this cross on her property that she got information last night when I was talking to her from connecting directly through her connections through the interplanetary confederation that there was once this aberration occurs on this miracle occurs on this cross, they say it's going to occur in October of this year. When it occurs then they are after, soon they are after, they will be landing some of their pod crafts onto a property, she's got 16 acres of land her and her husband, and they have the ship that I had talked about at the same time here once before, that's 100 miles in length, one of their main crafts. They have increased their intensity of being a ray of vortex around the property that's been increasing and it's very visibly felt when you're there. And she was saying she wants to ask a question as to if you can elaborate on this a little bit more as well as she's also been in contact with the commandant she'd call it, Sonanda, also known in our biblical terms as Jesus Christ who is known on the ship as Sonanda. Could you give us some elaborations on this? First of all, there is a high degree of likelihood of a particular conducive gateway between what you would label your October 50 and your March 50. So there is a higher degree of likelihood within that timeframe that some of these occurrences may in fact play out as far as the specific, the date, the amount. Since that is up to her participation, her particular willingness to grow and expand, it has in that sense not yet been exactly and entirely, precisely decided. The manifestation how that will come about will also be a great joy to discover, but understand that she is directly in touch with certain energy. You can say that they have extra dimensional or extra terrestrial connections and that upon again approximately the 50 of that October month onward for the following few months, the incidences of physicalized manifestations will increase. What is the, shall we say, highest degree of specificity we are allowed to share right now? I can share with you some things from being there that I already know about, which is that eventually what will happen is there will be a, how this will work, I'm not sure, but there's a null behind a property. Supposedly, all the types of wild animals that have never been there before will appear and they are appearing now. In a sense, this may also as well as physical to some degree also be symbolic, for in that sense it is preparing itself the area for the infusion of many energies. So the many energies that are not indigenous to that area may not necessarily entirely mean physicalized animals from your planet, though there may be some degree of that. There will be energy consciousness, styles of consciousness that are not indigenous to that area or this dimension at all, which will begin to appear and it is our strongest sensing that this is of utmost significance in this regard. And another sharing I will give to you before I answer my other questions are that they said there to have to be a limitation of because there's going to be people eventually coming from all over the world and at the last channeling I went to her house, I went in myself and I was getting some messages, transmissions that there was going to be a beam up physically of some of us who have been there. Now I understand what this means. This can mean what you call in your sleeping dream state, for understand again from our perspective that is physical as well, but to proceed. Okay, well, I was getting- You understand you mean physically in this waking dream, but we wish to say that perhaps you may first find it happening in the sleeping dream so you can get your feet wet. Exactly. And they told me that it would be outside and there'd be, I came up with 20 to 100 people and then she was getting it would be more than 100 people on the property at the time that it's happening. But again, this may not be entirely physical people can be consciousness factored into that number. Right. My other question is getting on to the intruders a little bit. They showed in a movie. By the way, we would prefer the terminology visitors, but do personally. Visitors. Well, they named it intruders, but that's not our thing. The perception of intrusion is by the individuals who are participating in the interaction with without any shall we say acknowledgement of their agreement to do so. So in terms of the- So when there is no acknowledgement of the agreement, it can appear as an intrusion. When there is acknowledgement of the agreement, here comes those visitors. It was very interesting. It showed these babies in what seems to be artificial life supporting systems in a circular part of the craft. Hey. Did you elaborate on that and they look very human? They in that particular instance were symbolic of hybridized beings. They were not entirely human, but had again many of the characteristics because as you say on your planet, there is a recapitulation in the embryonic stage of many of the species upon your planet. So therefore, depending upon the stage of development in the embryonic stage, there is the resemblance of many of the species that are attached. So shall we say they perhaps appear a bit more human in the fetal stage and as they grow a bit less. Okay, because what was interesting is towards the end of this particular film based on true information from the book, the woman- that one woman who had had a child, well, it was her child basically, but they had taken the child and it had been on the ship. And that particular instance did not have a biologically human father. Right. But the understand when the individual said it is mine in a sense, it was theirs as well. Right. And the child looked, I mean, obviously, very human. Was the child totally human? No. It was hybridized. But it didn't look hybridized. What would in that sense cue you into the hybridization? Again, that was only a symbolic presentation, was the larger cranium and shall we say in that instance so that not necessarily be entirely accurate, the farcered hair. Well, it was a female. Well, the female, the grown-up female, the taller female looked hybridized, but the child looked very much, you know, less hybridized. Perhaps you may wish to look more closer. My other question is, could you give us some general agendas as to things? I mean, from my going-for-win myself, which has been a real joy the last couple of months, I've been communicating with Tynia a lot, you know, just going through emotions and doing that. And also experiencing sensations of change on the whole planetary scale, increasing incredibly fast. And the LA riots and so forth, I perceive as being winds of change of energy that just went and they're gone. And now it seems there's a calmness. They are not in that sense gone. They are expressions, bursts of energy, being siphoned through the planet itself when it occurs as a, shall we say, weather or earthquake, manifestation, but also individuals can siphon this energy and it can sometimes burst forth in such presentations. But in a sense that has siphoned it to some degree, allowing many of the issues surrounding it to be put on the table so that individuals involved in it, as well as individuals only peripherally aware of it, are simultaneously viewing many of the same issues. What are the things in terms of a general agenda of the planet? Can you tell us about our planet since we live here that will be occurring that we should know about? Well, again, you know it is not our job or style to predict. But you can understand that great change is in full swing. It is already occurring. You are not just about to enter your transformational age. You are firmly within it. You have seen the signs around you, particularly from your 1988 year onward, many things occurring which seemed would never occur in this life. And that degree of acceleration will proceed. Keep your eyes firmly upon what you label your presidential election and the process and the individuals and many of the issues that come up and are viewed and some of the changes that result. Interesting. You bring that up because the political landscape, at least in the United States, is referring to what we live. Things to be, for lack of a better terminology, shaking up. Shaking up. Meaning, by the way, worldwide, but in your country as well. Right. And it seems to be, depending on how you think, you can look at it as either a positive or a non-positive thing, depending on who you are now in terms of... Well, again, it is literally both. So do you wish to experience that will determine and depend upon your interpretation? And finally, I recently went to an activation of Ascension workshop a couple of weeks ago in New York. Well, how exciting. Yes, it was a lot of fun and it was very, very interesting. And what we did was we all went into a circle with our heads in a star shape and it was a very calm day, a beautiful day and all of a sudden it became cloudy and there was all this lightning around it. It was very unusual because it was not real, but it wasn't unusual after... Well, what is your weather? But the product of your emotional body of your mass consciousness. And when you congregate with several individuals, perhaps you can say, you have a mini mass consciousness. Yes. So therefore, perfectly reasonable. Well, just to share what happened was that we... Did you physically perceive this craft or were you told that it was made? Well, we physically sort of perceived... I wouldn't necessarily see it, but the geom... The electromagnetic field was totally doing its thing because they had lowered their craft into... when they were lowering it, it affected the geomagnetic electronic field of the area. And what did you perceive? Well, I got up. Slowly, I fell very much like I wasn't in the same place. Even though I knew I thought I was in the condominium room as I went out to the back, everything looked neon blue, which was... and I didn't know what... I couldn't perceive where I was. The whole tree was, you know, like neon blue, and the room looked like it was transparent. Oh, you are beginning to attune to these energies. Congratulations. There was a lot of fun. Oh, that's it. And you... Shut it. You are. Hey. I saw the intruders also didn't care much for the title either. Oh. And I got a lot of ideas from it that rather than being abducted or detained, that some of this on this planet are now becoming aware of this idea and possibly would want to interact with them in a waking state, voluntarily, creating our reality according to preference. My reality by preference would be very excited to help them with this project. Then allow me to W. Sir in Baccidol. Thank you. And understand that you can simply render the invitation. And perhaps you will then allow yourself to feel or test your own water, or you can see how you react should they respond. What I did, I decided to create a gateway basically in the yard of my home. I discussed this with Kenny when he was up there one night. And I said, you know, if they are telepathic beings, they probably know that we are not afraid of them anymore, now that we know what they are. They in that sense, understand perhaps things about yourself sometimes that you do not allow yourself to see. So there may be the understanding that on the surface, you feel no fear, but they in a sense, consent what sub surface below the surface, the issues that perhaps you would force to the surface upon attracting a direct interaction. So therefore you can trust their sensing. And if you do find where there are areas where you still experience fear, pull out the wild card. Very interesting. Yeah, I thought a lot about interacting with them. I know I feel a lot of love towards their society. One other practical suggestion should you find yourself within a physical scenario. Perhaps you can say an open attitude of unconditional love and acceptance and in a sense greeting would be to extend your arms outwardly, palms forward and open and emanate and radiate from yourself on conditional love. That in a sense is felt very strongly and may also allow you to quell or calm any fears that come up once you allow them to serve you. I see. Now, from my understanding, in between life, people who are up to say the society could choose to reincarnate into a human form in our society. To be not in the way that you need. Can you explain that to me? Explain why you believe that that was done. I had read that in a book by Lisa Royale called Visitors From Within about the Satoric July. In this book, it more or less explained that some state of consciousness had more or less come into our society, into the human form, where later they would be, say, detained and the genetic material would be taken. They would not remember it most. Our perspective upon this is that it is very, very rare. For you are speaking about a society that though they present themselves in individual body, have a linked mentality and do not truly perceive themselves in the way that you are speaking of and the way that you experience yourself as an individual. So their particular relationship to reincarnation, so to speak, is a little bit different than yours and they have a tendency to, in the sense that they are individuals, reinsert themselves into their own reality. Now understand that one of the reasons aside from the aforementioned ones of their interactions with your society is also to observe many aspects about you as individuals for a day again, perceive themselves as a collective and are afraid, in a sense, afraid. You not entirely understand individuality in the way that you created. So therefore it is not so much that they incarnate into your society. If they did in a sense it would be disorienting so different and, shall we say, separated from the whole is it, that they physically interact with your society and one of the reasons is for the observation and to begin to amass information about emotionality and about individuality. Okay, I understand all that. Well how do they choose the actual individuals they run to work with then? Many times, again the agreements are made in what you consider to be between life's states but with humans who have reincarnated as humans and you will find many times that they will follow so to see particular family line, mother, offspring, offspring. So the agreements will also be between new man individuals to be born into such families. I think that the interpretation that I had of what I read was probably wrong and you could clarify it for me. No comment but again they were the same individuals that in perceived in unconditional love in your original and again ask them. They will be more than willing to tell you and will be overjoyed that you would. Then we can speak a little bit more. Can you have one more question? Oh what? On the program sightings that we've been watching on TV they said something about May 5th in the year 2000 there was going to be a massive ice build up at the south pole causing depression of the earth, crust and forces of the flow of underground earth lava to float in many earthquakes and the earth would end up tipping on its side. As far as the physiological shift? No that is not our perspective. As far as the acceleration of earth changes it is possible though our particular perspective does not at this time include that particular playing out. So there will be changes we do not perceive that particular overtones but that can change. Does that answer the question? Oh, at this time allow us to pause for a break of 10 to 15 of your minutes of counting and resume contact if designed at that time.
