 Alright, I'll say continue shitting. Hey, say mate. I wanted to share my shirt with England. Alright, do go ahead. Well, before I went, it was kind of funny because I was doing like a creative visualization stuff. And I have an imagination that I like to have fun. So I saw myself in a snow niche and I was sitting there meditating and I could feel like this vibration was under my butt. And all of a sudden I saw the blue crystal skull and I said, oh, this is great. I'll have to bring it back for a chance because I had just heard the tape and I really was never that interested in blue crystal skull. Small one. So the next day... One way to stay ahead, do proceed. Yeah, I get just one talk from my friend who was gone to England. I said, oh, this is great. I just got this visualization. So I got to see the blue crystal skull. Incidentally, for the purposes of clarification, although there are, perhaps you can say many such skulls. The actual skull you are speaking of and calling as the blue crystal skull is not actually the same physical skull that has been discussed, which has not yet been unearthed in that way. Though it is another version of that idea, do proceed. What version was it? Well, in other words, it is another skull, not exactly the one we were speaking of, though it has similar qualities and appearance. The actual skull we are speaking of is carved out of what you call, perhaps light blue, sky blue crystal itself. Yeah, this really didn't have blue. It had like a blue reflection, too. That was the distinction that I was making. So that was fun. And I got a lot out of that. And then when I went to Stonehenge, I went about 3.30 because my private time, which I did get a private time, was at 4.30. So at 3.30 we were sitting in the car and it was raining and getting to be kind of dark. And I noticed in the sky there was like a goldish light kind of going across. And I thought, although that was nice. And then I noticed there was like a line coming up in the field. And I really didn't take much of it because it was very, very subtle. And then I saw a blue light with a pink on either side of it. And I noticed that the line had gotten a little bit deeper. And I could actually see like a little cat into it. And then after that I went into Stonehenge where I had my private time. And I was kind of there for about 40 minutes. And that was quite fascinating because it was, when I went in there, I just allowed myself to be drawn to whatever rock that it was there. But I do want to say that I felt like it was the belly button of the earth. And did you stand in the so-called center of the circle? I did first. Oh, well, I performed. Then I walked around. Then I went into the center, but then I was drawn to a certain rock. So I sat down and I did like the full meditation. And what I saw was ex-a-tretro. And they were standing there with like their hands out to the sides, but opened up to me. And then I saw a pastel of myself. So what I was experiencing was the illusion of time. Where I was seeing my past and my future at the same time, but realizing that I was in the point of power. Well, in actuality, it is less of the illusion of time and more of the reality of simultaneity, but due proceed, this is simply semantic. That's exactly what I tell, that if I could actually feel the dream matrix that I was in the dream and that I really was... By the way, you still are, but due proceeds. Yeah. And I understand that now. But anyway, my pastel was actually someone who was doing a sacrifice there. In a sense. This is all metaphor for me. Very much so. And I looked because it was a fear and I actually was able to face it. But I saw where my pastel was doing a sacrifice. And I could steal all these feelings and everything. But I allowed them to steal them and then I can print it down and recast as a past. Do you understand that your physical presence there was a balancing and a blending of that experience in the present as well? Absolutely. Because I could see where that my pastel was actually in a powerless point by doing the sacrifice. Proceed. And what I did was put myself into the... by the recast and the pastel to the point of power into a self-empowerment and became an example of that. Thank you. It was fascinating in realizing that there really is no time, the past and the present time, tennis that were happening at this peak. And I put it into a point of power within the moment of self-empowerment. But that's about little lines and... Before you proceed, do understand that you need to go nowhere physically to have this experience. Any of you at any given moment for it is a recognition and a line that's a spark of knowingness which you can utilize external symbols to seem to inspire or you can simply express it. By all means, do use the symbols since you've created them but understand what they are doing. Do proceed. I've done that without even going to those places. Within my mind, I can shift my consciousness to that and actually do it without going there. My point is I... A vacation. You can simply go on a vacation by shifting your perspective to that place and play with it. Well, when you in that sense shift your perspective to embrace who you are rather than resist it than you're already on vacation. That's to the field. We had talked about that before. And I did get a lot out of what the symbols were and I did write them down and broke down what it meant to me. I have to say that it was the whole trip was very much unexpected outcome, very much the prize and very much about self discovery. And being in the moment. Absolutely. And to be consciously aware of symbols in the moment and to be open to receive and 100% trust. Oh, and graduation. Is there something else you wish to in that sense share with what you call this audience regarding your present activity if you will be so bold? Well, last week I was channeling and it was quite beautiful. And that would be who to you for the benefit of those who may not know. And that's the sign. All right, another entity or being or individual from my society do proceed. Quite beautiful. Well, they all are as are you. I would say it was a different approach. It was unexpected that Anya came through for me. Not from her end. Oh, what? She would not make that separation, but we understand the sense. And my imagination has been like so phenomenal lately. I do want to share one other thing that has happened. Is that all you wish to say about what you are doing, your insight in about it and your plans with it? Oh, the channeling. Well, I am open to channeling and I've been on with that. I'm one of the few individuals who take us up on our invitation in that sense we are quiet, in that sense excited about what you are doing. And should you so choose to proceed in doing so, by all means you can do so with your head held high actively. And I now tend to be there. Allowing other individuals to know what it is you are doing will allow you to attract the opportunity for more interaction which will expand your ability. Yay, everybody. And again, I thank you for applauding yourself. This one experience that I want to share has been kind of unique. And it's been happening off and on. I really haven't paid much attention to it until recently. I was in a medication once when it first started and it wasn't also an earth reality. And there was this gentleman that was sleeping and I had sensed that I was going into his dream state and his wife had just passed away and he had a newborn baby. And I sensed that it was one of my multi-dimensional selves and I kind of let it go. Well, spontaneously it's been coming in and he came in to my awareness the other day and I could see him sitting in his living room and there was a TV in front of him. And the TV was a little bit static and he adjusted the TV and when he did I could see myself on the TV. And it was almost as if he was channeling me. Well, perhaps that's one way to put it. Another way to put it is perhaps this is a vision of things to come. Oh, okay. Because I was getting all kinds of information about that. Oh, by the way, if you are so inclined vision of things to come. Oh, well, thank you for sharing it in such a way. And thank you for your ongoing willingness to extend yourself where we can find you, interact with you and allow you to also act in much the similar way as the channel before you. We thank you. Good. Shooting. Good night. See you next time. Did I understand you to say earlier that we can, by tuning ourselves and by retaining positivity, we can actually alleviate the transition on the planet. We can help. We can reduce negativity of transition. Absolutely. Because although it would seem as though you are upon a planet and things happen and then they happen to you because they happen, it is actually the opposite way around. It all begins from your experience, from your consciousness, and where your consciousness is at, will conglomerate around it. Shall I say other energies, individuals and experiences of like vibration? That is why when you shift to you are, others seem to change. This actually does have the expanse or extent or extent into your entire mass consciousness as well. So literally speaking, you may understand, when we say there is no one, the future. There are as many futures as there are individuals. We literally mean it. And it is absolutely plausible and possible that certain individuals in this room would experience one future. Other individuals, though you perceive yourself to be having a single experience on a single planet, can experience another future altogether. Sometimes you will remain aware of each other. And each other, other times you will not remain aware of each other depending upon the purpose of being served. The point is that your experience and your experience of what occurs to and within the mass consciousness will be largely contingent upon what you are focused on and attuned at that point. Which sounds perhaps a bit absurd if you believe you are an individual within a reality with other individuals. But when you begin to see yourself as a direct creator, you understand as you shift so does the reality shift across the board. So perhaps you will find this to be a bit of an exciting news. Very exciting. Oh, it is very exciting. What will you do? What will I do? As much attuned to my positive attitude as I can do. All right, then doing what excites you the most from what is available uniquely in any given moment and acting upon that with excitement would be a direct reflection of that. Whereby you are still performing actions, you are still being productive, but you are only doing so as a direct honor in the expression of who you know yourself to be. And so your transformation already has occurred. And it is simply a matter of enjoying the beginning. I still have the belief that I am a part of the next conscious, that I am a part of a whole. Oh, well, that is one aspect of that belief. The other aspect of that belief is that you also believe that the whole exists within you. To say you believe one or the other would be inaccurate. To be most precise, you believe both. So that is where the decision comes in. If you have both beliefs, then you are either expressing one or the other. And this is where the decision comes into play. Acknowledge that both exist for you. Acknowledge that both are true. And that gives an equal capacity to be chosen and committed to. We can do them both at different times. Can we not express it? Well, you can. If you consistently commit to one, you will get a more, shall I say, constructive and noticeable effect. When you shift over to the other, you can simply say, ah, I am expressing this belief. That is not the one I decided on. This is the degree to which what you decide registers, and your willingness to perpetuate that consciously rather than, again, being dictated to and shifting your decision. And in that way, keeps the consistency. Does that make sense? Yes, it does. Is that practical? I think it is. I think I guess I am unwilling to give a, or unwilling more, and ready to totally give up the idea that, that in fact, we, I am a piece of the planet, if you will. If you do not give it, by choosing a new, you simply become a new expression, which encompasses that idea, but is no longer bound by it. Does not use it as a premise that you limit yourself with. Thank you, Dad. That puts it in perspective. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Shitting. See me. I have a few questions. I will talk to you. Oh, do you feel see? I'm the first one. Is an individual able to interpret another individual consciousness? In the direct literal way that you mean? No. It is impossible. What you call possession is truly not possible because your body is an expression of your consciousness. It exists within your consciousness as one expression of it. Therefore, it is completely attuned to your consciousness. The only way to get the appearances that someone might be so-called inhabiting you is to match that vibration yourself and allow the idea to seem to come through you, but literally you are creating your own version of it. Allow me to use these channelings as an example. I do not in any way inhabit the body of the channel for that is impossible. It is a direct manifestation of his frequency as a consciousness. However, we have entered into an agreement whereby he will attenuate his consciousness, allow his consciousness to become more diffused from his so-called waking normal consciousness, which allows me to then, perhaps you can say, to or resonate his consciousness, to function in a frequency and listen to the word here, similar to my own. It is not exactly my own or I would simply be him, but it is similar enough that it gives me, shall I say, the energetic model or template to work with, I simply then add my intention, and then it automatically gets translated through his vibration, utilizing his own understanding, his own way of dealing with vocabulary, and to much a degree is limited in that sense by his own vocabulary, though it may be used with my energy a bit differently than he may choose to use it with his own. So there is the appearances that I am within his body, but simply his body is mimicking my vibration the two of us are creating literally a third frequency, separate so to speak from him, but still involving him, separate so to speak from me and still involving me. What you are actually seeing is not directly the channel, although it is his energy, it is not directly me, it is a third entity which is the harmonization of our vibrations for the purposes of communication. Does that make sense? Thank you. Next question. There are a couple of sessions, the previous sessions that I had the opportunity of listening to, say, you were addressing another woman in the picture that you are fundamentally exposed to being. My question, are they individual to your fundamental nature? Not really, for the idea of positivity is an appreciation and an understanding and an ability to express that appreciation. You are all inherently, perhaps it is even a better word, positivity oriented beings. You contain the polarity, you contain both possibilities for expression, but ultimately since you are creative forces fundamentally, that will take the form of the positive, which is integrative, inclusive, and in that sense not segregated or separating. There is a degree of what perhaps you would refer to as negative energy, though not with the connotation of negativity, that actually allows physical reality to even exist. For there must be some separation from the one, all that is primal source, and you the transparency of being able to look at something as though it is external, but fundamentally in your consciousness as creators you are positive beings. So therefore, perhaps more accurate than your typical biblical description of you as individuals. Having been born of original sin would be exactly opposite from my own explanation. I would say you all come from original grace. Thank you. Thank you. Shutting. Hello. My name is Greeti. Hello. Hello. Skull full line. Oh. I had so much to talk to you about, but no questions really arise. Oh, thank you. That's true. I thought you were being inside. Yeah, it's funny. It's a really funny connection with you tonight. Always funny tomorrow. No, it just feels really different to me in this moment, and it's good. I just love you. I just really feel very close to you. So, thank you very much. Remind you that I love you and all of you unconditionally and completely as well, and I'm not saying you can't lose that love no matter how you treat yourself. Right. So, you're on your scalp craft and I'm going to have to ask you if you're well at this there. Two individuals that we have not discussed in these interactions. Do I know? You all understand there are approximately 200 to 250 million individuals upon my climate. So it need not be such a surprise that there may be a few you have in turn. But, synchronistically, when we have asked, we usually do no something. And one that maybe hang out with you, we're going to know. That's why I see it. And that's why I wanted to ask. Oh. And your observations of whatever you're observing, are they included in that with you? We are in that sense to be less cryptic about it, observing certain phenomenon that have to do with what you would call planetary bodies, what you would call your solar body or sun. And what you would call your various probes or crafts that are in that sense en route. Now, we are not in any way, shape, or form interfering with that. Simply observing. Something's wrong with them. No. No. That's great. So the other two, you really have nothing to do with Earth as far as your observations, just because you're in the area. I do not say that. Generally speaking, if there are individuals present with me physically, when I am interacting with you, they have some type of a vested, shall I say, interest in these interactions. Understand that we have no names per se and that they are provided to you out of convenience, and these two individuals have not, perhaps you can say, been assigned a name, and for specific reasons we will keep from that one. I find it fascinating anyway. Oh, fight you so do that. Yeah, greetings to them, whoever they are. Re-served from all of us. Also, today, Allie and I, we visited with some of these Inca elders, for shaman from Peru, and they're from a very remote tribe in the Andes Mountains. And I was just so moved by these people and what they seem to contain in themselves. I know that we contain it also, but they were the most generalist childlike people. Well, congratulations, because these are now qualities that you as an individual are entertaining to begin to express on a regular basis. And so therefore, obviously, you have attracted blatant symbols to yourself of how this is actually possible in the situation. Yeah, sure, they came to America this last month to share with us their prophecy, and it's their time, it's been like five, six hundred years, and they called the Condor, Meade and the Eagle, and so forth. But it's amazing that their perception of our society, they were thrilled by our technology and our buildings and our highways, yet they were also very moved and kind of saddened by our disconnection with each other. Oh, right, but that is not necessarily so across the board, and perhaps only a small population was being sampled to come to such a conclusion. Do understand that there are many, many, many individuals who are very actively beginning to express themselves in more empowered terms are beginning to very actively expand to encompass more of themselves and being willing in that sense to act that way. So it is both sides, though I understand the sentiment you aren't sharing. Sorry, they asked you, what is your interpretation overall in form of what you call a synopsis of what you got out of the information that you attracted from them? That the world is as possible. Was that such a surprise? Yeah. Oh, because I still go through that. Have we not discussed many times that such a thing is, perhaps you can say, more than possible and highly likely? Yes, we have. You will understand that you have now attracted to yourself, perhaps you can say a slightly more acceptable or slightly more reinforcing symbols to allow you to entertain this from another direction? Yeah, I know that I attracted that for that reason. I really do. Even though I go through my days being quite disintegrated some time, no longer need to speak that way. All right. Now I ask you, since it is apparent to me that there is something else, what else did you learn? A great value to you as an individual in interacting with these other individuals? Man, you don't tell me. Allow us to be obvious. I mean, I, um... I, I, uh... I could think of anything, don't I? Allow the one that comes up to come up and says we share it. Trust me. I'm, I was just moving my feelings. I was very moved by who they are. And... their child, what do you tell me? Are you, are you going to study with anybody or anything? Oh, perhaps the connection that I have with them? Maybe not. What did you learn about yourself that you feel you did not know prior to the interaction? I don't know. Oh. I just heard. Allow it again to be obvious and when it comes up by all means, feel free to call in. All right? Hang in like that. I am doing nothing but, in that sense, giving you the opportunity to share who you are. I appreciate you. It is up to you to rise to that timing or not. Yeah. I, I just think that it's my ability to be able to be like that. Oh, what a hint. What did you discover about your emotional self? Any questions? I couldn't. Anybody else? No. For themselves? You might as well be in child life. Perhaps that I contain that child like love unconditionally. All right. What moved you about what you have referred to as their innocence? Sounds like it gave you hope. Perhaps hope, yes. All right. There is no necessary reason in that way to struggle to allow yourself to come to a simple recognition. Allow it to be obvious. Allow it to happen when it doesn't trust the timing of it. Understanding that aside from the fact that world peace is probable, there has been another personal lesson that you had learned, that you understand well, and no one else needs to spell it out for you. If indeed that does become obvious within the course of the rest of this interaction, please share. Well, I just think, lastly though, I will just add that as far as world peace, and I'm taking an exciting step, again with my peace clock idea to be able to share some world peace, which I'll remind everybody is to think world peace at 12 o'clock, your time zone, is basically what I want to share with everybody. And the world. Well, I think either one, you know, it's synchronous to the internet's intention. And my project is moving along, and I'm taking a new step, putting a lot of money out there, which is fine, it's energy. And I wanted to report that to you because I'm going into the new year with this new computerized disk, with this information on it, and that's exciting to make. In that sense, continue to experience what you call difficulty, simply relax, let go, allow yourself to be who you are as opposed to forcing yourself into being something that is not natural. Here we go. Okay. All right. Thank you very much, brother. All right. Thank you as well. Shitting. Come on. See you man. Hi, Alon. Reaching. About a month ago, I did that meditation where I visited your mothercraft, and I just wanted to tell you about it and see what kind of feedback you had for me. Oh, how exciting. Do rosy. Right now, I'm really nervous and so I can see you're asking you. Excitement and what you call anxiety or a similar energy with a slightly different interpretation. Assume it to be excitement and pussy. I'm excited. I'm excited. I'm excited. We don't like that. Well, when I got up to the mothercraft and I had it envisioned the way, you know, I had it in my imagination, I felt like I was with a number of other people who were doing the same thing. This is extremely likely impossible because understand time has little meaning in these exercises. And so thereby when we have led such guided meditations with individuals and they are so-called up there on the ship, that does not necessarily mean that your perception of them being up there or not will happen within the same timeframe. So literally you joined others that were present in these types of interaction in perhaps what you have called your tape, but in what you would perhaps consider to be an out of step. And in other words, when individuals had in that sense gone on the guided meditation, if you would like to call us that, of our scout craft, many of them spoke about seeing people that were not physically in the room at that time because they had come later or at different points, though it still perceived to them as though it was happening at the same time. So you may in that sense have even noticed people you recognize. Well, I kind of felt like I was with the group that like comes here too. Perhaps that was a faster way to say it. So when I answered the mother craft, like I sort of envisioned the lobby as like a Star Trekky sort of lobby. There is no lobby but do proceed. And I felt like I was surrounded by beings, but I didn't see anybody. And I was just hanging out with them and I had a bit of resistance and fear over the experience, but I was still open to going for it. And then you would say something about if you like, you can go wherever you want in the spaceship, or you can go play with the children, which a number of the other people from the tape is done. And I don't quite know what I did at that time. I just remember standing in this place and I felt all these beings around me. And then you would say go to the auditorium where the association of worlds was. So I flew to the auditorium with all these other beings and I entered this big auditorium. And I knew there were other beings from all over and there was like this big party going on. And again, I was standing there with a few beings this time, but I didn't really see anybody. And incidentally, do understand that because we are all collectively and individually in touch with many different levels of consciousness, you are simply perceiving some of these so-called levels of consciousness that would not translate physically to you. And you will find that some portion of our population even consists of these transients, perhaps you can say consciousnesses, who will from time to time actually create their version of an esosani body for a temporary period of time. So you were in that sense perceiving actual consciousness that were not physical in the way you are accustomed. And then the one thing, when I was really able to say like let go, something really weird, I saw this man's face, it was a white face. It was almost like a tribal man who was in like these bushes and there was light and dark there. I just remember seeing that vision very quickly, it was at a time when I really was able to let go and I actually saw this face. And can you just tell me what that meant? Hey, this will in that sense correspond to what you generally refer to as a guide consciousness that you are familiar with throughout your life, though perhaps you have not given a designation or a name. Did you sense the familiarity? Yeah, I guess. You are not used in that sense to interacting with this individual in that form, hence it may have seemed a bit odd at the time. Look into what I am saying and it will become more apparent what I mean. Okay, thanks. Oh, thank you. I do have a few other things. For accepting our invitation. Okay, it was great. You sound surprised. Did you think you would come upon our craft and have a bad time? No, not at all. Oh, not at all. I've had notions and thoughts of making connections with other life forms over the years and I've actually, and I just wondered what kind of input you can give me on this. I've had a tremendous amount of fear and resistance to this as I feel like contact is trying to be made to me. What is it that you fear in the idea of contact being made in this way? I feel like completely out of control in that way. For that is truly impossible. Of course, if you build into your decision, a indecisiveness or some ability that you can be overcome, you can create that aparency. But simply, you can be more definitive than wondering what will happen and simply decide, here is who I am. This is who I am. Now I either invite or decide this is not the type of interaction I wish. Well, I'm certainly open to it and it absolutely excites me to connect with other consciousness and life forms. There's no question. Oh, why? It just says that there's a lot of adubduction and those sort of thoughts come in that I'm going to be taken against my will kind of thing. You know? You know, my perception that that is the type of arrangement that you would in that sense experience. Good. It is not part of your agreement, but not because of a fear-based idea, simply because it is not the exact thing that you will be doing. Other individuals fulfill that purpose for their own specific reason. And more and more are they becoming aware that they were not victimized and in fact were part of the decision-making process. Okay. Is this resistance related to opening up to more of myself and how can I incorporate it? Well, it's sense. Yes. And you may understand that you can begin your embats the door-ship if you would like to call it that with other individuals in your own society. In other words, by being willing to extend yourself, this can occur across the board and not only in that specific, perhaps very unconventional way. So thereby, you can use your own individuals that you are aware of in your own society to begin to function and act in this way. Okay. Remaining grounded with what you do have paradoxically sets you up for a more expanded type of physical experience as well. So in other words, to capitalize what I am saying, work with what you have. Okay. I have one more question. Follow-up. With my choice to be the artist that I've always been, I've chosen a part to work with photographs. And this has excited me and has created tremendous amount of energy and excitement and creativity and flow and everything. However, I realized that to work with photographs and do renderings of drawing paintings and whatnot from them, I just wondered what your perspective was on my need to get permission, either from the copywriter or from, I mean, at the copywriter, the publisher or the artist or photographer himself. What is your- The idea being is that your recognition of integrity, which is the integration of all things, would take into consideration the agreement whether direct or implied, that are made in instances and circumstances of your reality and honoring them with the type of respect you yourself would demand. Okay. Period. That allows you to function as an integrated being. That's what I thought. And you will find invariably, perhaps across the board you will get that permission. And establish contacts. And establish, as you say, networking in the process. Okay. Thank you very much. Well, thank you. Shutting. Nice, mate. And to you, good day. I've talked in here a lot over the past few years, I guess, about wanting to have a career that I feel is my harsh path or following my excitement, which has to do with helping make the world a better place. Sounds vaguely familiar. Yeah. So the other day I was working on, or looking at an old computer and going through files in it. And I saw a lot of things as I had written about, you know, economic and political reform three, four, five years ago and was thinking, oh, this stuff is good, but I never did anything with it. And lately I've been feeling a little bit disillusioned with myself. Changing your decision again, eh? I guess so. Mostly, in fact, in reviewing what you call this so-called older material, another way to look at it is, ah, I already have a lot of what I need rather than I didn't do anything with that now, did I? And it all boils down to what your decision will be right now about yourself. If you decide I choose to now express this, looking over all these old things will simply be the tools and resources that are now being attracted to you because you are ready to use them, not because it is a reminder of having a computer. And it's a reminder of having failed once again. Okay, well, one of the things that's I didn't- Before we proceed, are you committed right now to expressing yourself in the way you have just stated? All right. In this moment committed to it. In the way that I've just stated what do you mean? To have the thing that brings you joy and you can do with passion be your job. All right. Then that is a decision I believe. That is a decision that registers. Now simply continue to see through the eyes of that decision, no matter what presents itself. And you are already that person. All the tools are there. All the resources are already there. Anything you have done here to for up till now can help, can contribute to your now moment decision that this is what you're going to do. Okay. Well, I've had, um, in the past I've made great progress at two points in my life because I had a very clear vision of what I wanted to do. When I was 27 I decided I wanted to move from New Jersey to California and major in parapsychology at UCLA. Now when I was 20 I decided that. And when I was 27 I decided I wanted to move back in California and go to Harvard and get an MBA. And I did both of those and because I had a clear goal, I overcame all the obstacles that were in the way and did whatever I had to do to make that happen. Lately I haven't had that clear vision of what I want to do with my future. All right, what is it that was clearer about the so-called other vision? Well, I knew exactly what I wanted so it was clear what steps I had to be saying. All right, what are you unsure about now in what you want? In other words, it is my perception that you have a very specific vision of what you will be doing. Where are you to simply go about beginning to do it? I have no idea. What is not clear about that vision? Well, it's not exactly clear what my future will be. Well, that is given in terms of the way that you create physical reality. But can you see yourself in that way doing the thing you say excites you? And it is my perception that you can see yourself doing that. There is your clear vision. Why do you assume your vision is any less clear? Although perhaps the steps will require being a bit more creative. Taking in the variables in your reality and spitting them back out in a creative way. In other words, there is not an enrollment process and the very finite concrete steps that one takes too in that sense partake of what you call education system. However, you can still see yourself up in front of a crowd, speaking to people, motivating them, watching their faces as what you say begins to register in them. And they begin to see within themselves they already contain the ability to do all of the things they always wish to do. I have no problems or no difficulty picturing you speaking in this setting and seeing you picturing yourself speaking in this setting. Is that a clear vision? Yeah, I guess what it is that it may have gone just a little afraid of itself. Well, then perhaps the question to ask yourself is does it truly excite you or is it desirable to you for some other reason with another agenda? Now, if the reason is that it does truly excite you, I remind you that the so-called nervousness that you are seeking of, you also had when and before you went to California, when and before you got your MBA and so forth. So that never stopped you either. I don't know. I've often wondered if my desire to articulate a better way comes from a need to have people like me. Well, perhaps it is more directly from a need to see a better way. And this is why it comes back to you living this way, being an example, getting the results which then make you or allow you to be that much more effective at communicating it to others, because you then have the vision of yourself in action as a living example to fall back on. Now, would you agree with me when I make the statement that you have indeed across the board, no matter what you still may feel, is unchanged or still the old approach that you have across the board experienced many blatant examples of how you have changed. Yes. Have you seen many of your relationships and so forth shift as you shift? Yes. No, that's why. Then it is simply a matter of redefirming or renewing for your year of renewal, whether indeed what you have said is the thing that really excites you, communicating empowered ideas to other individuals in whatever form you should so choose, you can decide whether or not this is still your passion or not. Now it is my perception that it is and continues to be your passion. simply a matter of in your upcoming year be willing to do what you have already done get out there set up the time attract and trust whoever comes speak to them and allow the process to begin because while you are in the process there is little time to feel what you call anxiety you are simply too busy doing while you are conceptualizing there is plenty of time to create all the apprehension you need i've been networking and i'm setting up some opportunities to be growing next year on the environment but i think the idea of that getting closer and the possibility of you know sometimes worry about me failing or not being like that uh... co-op on the thing i need to do in the short term all right who is it that you are trying to impress when you say you fear not being like who is it that will not like well it is simple it is you for someone comes along as we have said and said you are white with purple polka dot it has no effect on you it rolls right off you because it's not you if you look in the mirror and you create your version of such polka dot you create the anxiety but only because you created your version of what they were saying so therefore other individuals liking you will not affect you if you like yourself if you fluctuate your relationship with yourself you will seem to see that reflected and enhance and perhaps amplify through others and your perception of their opinion of you but ultimately if you do as we had discussed earlier with other individual in terms of on conditional self-love you will understand that there may be people who very well do not like you because you're empowered you point may actually threaten their disempower is that an individual under those circumstances who you even require the affection of the idea being that you may just simply go on the assumption because of the diversity in individuals in your society that for now whatever you do will have its audience and it will have its detractors so it is not necessarily simply a matter of being worried about not being like by others it is a matter of believing in what you do which you do believe in it being willing to do that thing without hesitation and all the while reminding yourself that your love for yourself is unconditional and that may mean yes today and i am speaking as you i did screw up i did eat too much i did do this thing i did speak this way and guess what since i'm going to decide i love myself or i don't love myself i still decide to love myself that is unconditional in the most pragmatic and perhaps monday in the terms you refuse to yield to the option to not love yourself in that moment once you begin to work with this and continually remind yourself and perhaps even go out and do things that you don't like so that you have the opportunity to love yourself anyway to simply be a bit humorous about it you will find that you now can move forward and in the moving forward the doing all the anxiety is shed that is really that simple i mean by the way listen to your decision everything out of your mouth is a decision you're right it isn't that simple in fact life is a struggle in fact life think the reason i think that is because you get on the core issue that i've been working on for you know eight years in recovery and spiritual growth and that is just loving myself and not judging myself so harshly understood that eight years will all lead to a single moment and that moment can be now can be tomorrow can be three years from now but it will all occur in the uh... you know in that moment the decision to you know if i do something that i think i should not have done like over either something like that there's a judgment to get myself your failure you can't be what you want to have discussed many times that what you are calling the judgment of yourself is not a voice but a choice do you recall that distinction or then once the information is to your awareness it's up to you to choose to use it or not and here is where i am telling you that nothing is imposed upon you from the choices within you always will you be there making that ultimate decision of this empowered possibility in this disempowered possibility i choose this then you'll go into because and you'll give your long list of reasons you chose it but still you choose it and this is the only place where you are going to find in any given now moment you have your complete power to transform yourself in any given moment and permanently so until you commit to making that decision all right i know all these other possibilities are out here but here's the one i'm committed to until then you will continue to feel fluctuation the moment you do that you can't like if i did what you're saying and i mean conditionally love myself but i could reach the state of nirvana where life would be this this but i want to get back to the term well going on around me that is an accurate shall i say interpretation of what i have said so i'm wondering that so many about what that but it seems to do do it at least this nobody is told or nobody is reminded i shall say that you are the one who decided there is still some idea there is some overall emotion out there love hate that is directed towards you and that since everyone else has that i agree but now we are discussing conscious creator who now we are discussing that you do fall into decision with these ideas now we are asking what decisions do you want to make and now we are reminding you that ultimately no matter what you do you will have decided between the options and you will there the fruits of whatever that decision is positive or negative i wonder if your consciousness is like ours in the sense that what you say is that you track the goal of me and i'm sure for many others i remind you that i have lived a human life and i remind you that this then allows me to stay with absolute certainty that although it may that what i am saying works easier upon my planet it does work the same way on yours and the only difference is the approach and the willingness to in that way be consistent remind yourself no matter what i love myself before i even proceed before entertain all of these choices i love myself that's not something that i can remove because all right survival says i must love myself whatever the reason you give to decide then you can go about the specific ideas will i'm judging myself all right why well because i have done this particular thing well alright i'm reminding myself that even judgment is a choice what can i get out of the judgment well i can get out of the judgment that i would prefer to not be the type of person who does this all right now as a conscious creator how can i integrate that into my reality well i can decide here is who i am and here is what i do which is decidedly not this other thing again you're not running from that thing but you're reestablishing who you actually are once you have decided i am this person and i will let you plug in the own variables of what that person is a mean to you you then get up go about your business that person understanding that the judgment was a choice that no longer serves you in that way is that too simple and too good to be true that's great believe me on film this is that many times but i'll wait takes one the i've got to get right now i'm committed to write some reports on utilities that i've been procrastinating on and it works really hard to do and i said i can't be doing this again next year because it seems so hard to do and i you know right now i just need to get through and write thirty more reports but i have to write and you shall i've done nothing i think i won't get understood but that is not the you that will get them done you will shift to the you that has decided that it's very exciting that you are now willing to shed the last vestiges of obligation and begin to dive completely into your excitement and so therefore shedding those vestiges is a symbol of your transformation and i've entered are you you are now making a new set of decisions that are completely not relevant to what we have been discussing and i would caution you being that i understand what you say you desire to make such a statement for only will such a statement so-called come true because you make him perpetuated so there was a choice from within you which i assume you entertained and stated as a decision but in that sense was just a choice but i think what has not excited you have supported you for so long what does excite you can only support you more abundantly okay i just have a three-general question all three more all right it's always a new moment first question comment on the impact of the is the environment on us and the needs to take the entire uh... i would still uh... thing that we can uh... channeling by kryon and uh... i would think in the first book which talked about the norill implant but i'm not really that familiar with but supposedly have some nice benefit do you uh... explain what that is are you familiar with that defined norill implant it's a totally some way of releasing past karma so that you're not you know tied to working out relationships and then why you can just look you know for your second without hindrance if such a thing were to be inserted and did have that effect it would not be because of anything but your decision that when i put this in it will work and the idea is that you can simply come to the decision that everything is even everything is worked out with your life from this moment forward as though you are neutral and a new and get that effect completely and not break any so-called laws of karma for what you refer to as the law of karma is generally the law of retribution not the actual law of karma which designates and deals with balance and balances instantaneous perhaps often you are confused individually by hearing the statement what you put out is what you get back because it assumes you put something out and something comes back later that is not truly accurate what it is that you always experience immediately the reality that you're being the vibration of so it is instant karma if you will and the last one is um... you said you want it up to be insane we were going to go on a trip to get you want it up to be grounded and to the next year at this particular time what's big about ninety seven why we need to be grounded for what's going to happen i am not what you would call a big fan of coming attractions i believe that part of going through the entire process of forgetting ninety nine point nine nine nine percent of who you are in order to have an experience should be honored so again i have you the analogy i would not come to your house and unwrap your christmas gifts for you nor will i do the disservice of telling you something which would be rather arbitrarily perceived anyway at this time allow me for the first time and also again to remind you that what we are discussing and the simplicity of simple decision in the moment is already how you create there's nothing new to learn in that you are experts and your muscles are strong to create your own reality the only thing that we have introduced is that you no longer need to negate or in that sense ignore who you know yourself to be who you desire to be your ideal version of yourself because that exists within your consciousness all it takes is to have that built into the decision and to be very specific about the qualities of that person to allow you to express that because i remind you you contain it all allow me to wrap up if you will with a statement perhaps that has become apropos in what you call your literature your entertainment for this quite all right appropriate to in that sense and this interaction and that is only you know who you are you can allow yourself to be that person you can define who that is and dive into being that person or you can continue for the time being to resist yourself and allow me again to wrap up with the following statement in this case if you do decide to resist yourself it is truly so that resistance i bid you a most fond and loving today
