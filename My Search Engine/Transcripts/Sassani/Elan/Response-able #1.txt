 All I now say I bid you green things this evening of your time as you create time to exist, I will not ask you how you are, for I know that you are all perfect. A perfect reflection of whatever it is you are expressing in any given moment. Allow me to begin this interaction with the following entitlement. Response, able. We have been discussing many things with members of your society for what you call many years of your time and most recently have endeavored in that test to simplify the information that we share with you so that it is both accessible and implementable or usable. Therefore, most recently, the many concepts that we have discussed from any angle have been broken down into but free simple categories. In that sense, you in creating your own reality at each and every moment always do some form of the following. You make a decision about who you are in any given moment. You base that decision on many different ideas, often individuals will in that sense base that decision on external circumstance. I am this person because this has occurred to me. Often individuals will base that decision on what you call feedback from what you consider to be other individuals. I am this person because everyone tells me so all the time, so I must be. And most recently, we have discussed with you the option of having that decision simply be a reflection, a statement of who you know and prefer yourself to be, for only you, truly know you and the decision that you make will determine your experience that will then seem to support the decision that you make. Once you make that decision in any given moment, in every given moment, in fact, you then trust that decision till you change it. Trusting that decision can also be defined through the idea of maintaining that decision. If you commit to the decision and allow yourself to maintain it, you are performing the expression of trust in the initial decision. What we also discussed is that in the way that you create your reality, step three, if you wish to call them steps, are that you then take an action in your reality. Though you are fundamentally infinite beings, you are exploring the idea you call linear reality, which creates the apparent sea of what you call before, during and after. When you are, shall we say, playing your reality and expressing it through the idea of linear means, actions that you take are the hub, are your most visible expression that seem to create a cascading effect, a cascading series of what you call causes and effects that then seem to create your reality physically. Understand the following distinction between what you call actuality and what you call a parent sea. The actuality, if you will, is the idea that you are multi-dimensional, infinite and eternal beings. The apparent sea that you create to explore yourselves in a very finite discrete way is the idea that you are linear beings. You are born, you live, and you die, and that is it. Often as you begin to entertain the actuality of the idea that you are infinite beings, you begin to express more and more of the infinite potential that lies within you because your approach in exploring linear reality is to explore your reality as a seeming series of events. You create your reality, so to speak, as a gradient from what you call the infinite, and therefore you generally will gauge your experience along what you call a gradient. Therefore, though the actuality is that you create your reality 100%, in every given moment, the apparent sea would seem to be that you do not have complete control over your entire reality. The porthole that allows you to begin along the line of the gradient to express yourself consciously is the idea you call action. If you wish to insist that you do not have complete control over your entire reality, you may understand that playing with the gradient that you create, you do have complete control over one thing, your action, whatever action you take in any given moment, which we will refer to also for the purposes of this interaction as your response. You always have complete control over your response, the action that you put out in your reality. In that sense, you accept your reality. You make decisions about it and then you respond. And it is this response that you have total control over in every given moment. Therefore, the way that you experience this gradient increasing of expressing yourself consciously and creating your reality according to preference is by first gauging your response. By first allowing your response to be reflective of your decision, by allowing your actions to reflect, to express the decision that you make about yourself. You always do this anyway, as you say somewhat automatically, but the idea is once you become aware of how you express your reality, once you become aware of the methodology through which you create your own reality, you then allow yourself the option of doing so consciously. We have discussed in detail the idea of having the decision that you make be conscious. We have discussed in detail the idea that maintaining that decision can also be a conscious choice. Continuing to make the decision about yourself that is representative of who you prefer yourself to be, who you know yourself to be, rather than what everyone says you should be and what in that sense your reality seems to dictate you already are. And therefore, conscious choice comes into play. Because again, you express yourself on a gradient, you have a tendency not to automatically and immediately transform the entire face of your reality in such an instantaneous way. You play with the gradient. You play with the idea of unfurling yourself a bit at a time. Again, the aparacy is that it is your actions that create the series of events that eventually position your physical life to be the life that you desire. Now as you have mentioned, you can spontaneously in any given moment transform your entire reality completely. But you have again a tendency not to do so for very specific reasons. The reasons are to maintain the degree of focus that you have chosen to express as a physical being and therefore rather than forsaking yourself because some portion as you sometimes break yourself up into seems to decide that you will not transform immediately. You can still play with the idea you call your response for you are always able in any given moment to gauge your response to choose what it is that you do. Then as a being that would seem to create a separation between your perception what you take in from your reality and your action or response what you put out in general you will go through the following motion. You will perceive your reality generally through what you call your senses. You will then play an interpretation upon that perception. Then you will respond. I do not necessarily mean the emotional reaction that you create. When I say response I am specifically referring to you eventually do something with the information. You eventually act. This is where your power lies if you have chosen to create the idea of transforming on a gradient. Now it is very easy to see whether you have chosen to transform on a gradient or not in what you call a higher self level. Simply if you close your eyes decide that everything around you will transform and you open your eyes and many things still seem the same so to speak. You can assume that you have chosen the gradient path and you can use the path that you have chosen rather than forsake it by gauging your response or you are always able to respond and have complete control over your response if you are willing to acknowledge that and express that as opposed to have your decision be that your response your actions are automatic they are out of your control and then place the plethora of explanations as to why your response is out of your control. It is my ego. It is my tendency. It is my habit. These are things that you create as ideas to create literally an excuse that your response is not conscious and purposeful but always if you are completely willing to acknowledge yourself can you understand in any given moment that your response is up to you. When you perceive an event or a circumstance and then interpret that event or circumstance because you create the apparent that the action is what it is that transforms the reality in a sense you create a buffer so that not every single random thought that you have becomes a reality therefore making your life seem like a random series of events. By using the action as a gradient you give yourself more finely tuned control from the many thoughts the many ideas the many explorations that occur to you in perception to only express one's purposefully and only have the ones that you choose and express purposefully have a result in your life and this is how you gauge your actions utilizing the apparent see that your actions create your own reality. In actuality as you say thoughts are things but the apparent see that you are using to create in a very focused way is that it is the action that corresponds from those thoughts that actually moves the reality in a linear way therefore again rather than forsaking yourselves constantly you can simply gauge your response you are response able you are response and able and simply by realizing this that is all it takes to begin to do so so by all means you can continue to perceive your reality you can continue to initially interpret your reality according to habits some of which may be negative but if you are willing to withhold action until you realign to the positive decision of who you are you can give yourself the opportunity through that buffer to only have very specific positive results the idea that action creates the reality again is a parent see but it is an apparent see that you create for a reason in every given moment the actuality is that whoever you decide you are you are that person but the apparent see that you create again for the purposes of focus and purposefulness is the idea that the action that you then take will physically create in the physical reality therefore that is where your power lies if you are choosing to exist and create and express your reality from the gradient of action thereby you give back to yourself your power for even if your initial assessment of a situation interpretation of a situation is negative if you are willing to not immediately act with that negative foundation if you are willing to remind yourself re align yourself to who you know yourself to be and then respond then act you then create the apparent see of total control of your reality not in how the circumstances play out but in how you respond because one of the things that you are exploring is the idea of hiding part of yourself from all of yourself so that you can experience the apparent see that you learn that you grow and that things are unexpected it is part of the gradients that you are creating that circumstances that come into your perception will be from time to time unexpected but when your actions that arise from these circumstances are positive are aligned to your decision or aligned with who you know yourself to be then only can the results of those actions generate positive physical circumstance and results the key is continuity and persistence in having that be an unbroken approach an unbroken series of actions an unbroken series of actions that are reflective of your positive decision and your positive trust in that decision about who you know yourself to be and therefore if you are willing to restrain so to speak yourself from acting until you are realigned flawlessly consistently persistently and all of your actions are positively aligned to your decision then your reality even along the very gradients that you are creating transforms extremely quickly and seemingly miraculously what you are now in alignment with who you say you are you are now expressing yourself consciously according to preference once again you begin to do this without interrupting yourself so to speak nothing is truly an interruption but when you insert actions which are based on a negative foundation which are negative actions negative interactions with other people negative responses to your reality then each of those actions will seem along the gradients the appearances that you create to also have an effect quote unquote down the line so the appearances when your actions are not gauged and consistently positive or that things that happen to you are not consistently positive oh everything is going so well you say then the first sign of something coming up that would seem to be negative many of you as you say to use your vernacular cave you cave in and say oh it doesn't work not realizing that that negative seeming circumstance is the direct results when action that you have taken because you are in a sense playing along the gradient the appearance that the actions have a momentum that the actions are causal and a textual and so therefore again your result becomes scattered random if you are willing to gauge your response which means you can have any initial reaction perception to anything that is occurring in your reality but simply do not act on simply remind yourself of who you are and then act and perhaps be completely willing to not act at all until you realize then your actions will become an unbroken series of expressions positive expressions of who you say you are and again one of the rules that you create through the appearance the gradient of action is what you call actions speak louder than what you call words one way to put it in breaking this down and still keeping it simple is that your action your response in any given moment is the strongest expression of whichever belief you are expressing in that moment so if you allow your action to be automatically a result of a negative perception you are expressing in your reality physically a negative belief it is not that belief happened to you as I have reminded you many times you contain all beliefs all the belief and its opposite but what determines the response the reaction the creation in your life is which one you act on the one you act on in that given moment is telling you of all the belief that I contain I am expressing this one your action is the direct reflection of your strongest belief in the moment that you are performing that action no matter what you say therefore your ability to respond consciously your responsibility is your power and is the simple key the simple focus to allow you to apply the knowledge that you have attracted up to this point in your life more accurately it is the knowledge that you already contained and are now willing to express but perhaps the missing link the puzzle piece the key for which many of you say you search is the idea of being willing to withhold your response your action in a given moment until you are positively aligned now to give you an idea even along the gradient of cause and effect doing something and getting an effect of how short a time even with a gradient that you can transform your entire life visibly is what you call three weeks of your time if you wish to get what you call proof of this idea you can see absolutely compelling reflection by merely being willing to be consistently positively aligned in your actions for a near three days of your time therefore many of you say over and over and over and over and over and over again that you desire to create the life that you prefer that you desire to express yourself in your reality and have an impact in your reality the key to doing so along the gradient assuming that you haven't made the decision and seen your reality miraculously change in that moment is this idea of allowing your actions to only be purposeful you have an expression count to ten individuals will sometimes use this expression do not immediately act from impulse as you say generally impulse by the way can be interpreted one way to interpret it in the negative is to have an immediate reaction every response rather than a purposeful action every response and your idea counting to ten merely creates a gap an artificial gap between the idea of immediate impulsive negative action and the idea of realigning to who you are for generally speaking for most of you it can take a mere ten seconds or thirty seconds to realign to who you are in almost every given situation therefore another way to look at this is just as important as your willingness to act according to who you know yourself to be is your willingness to refrain from acting until your foundational decision and trust is realign to the you you prefer to be not the you that you say may be so undesirable for those of you who that say that your power on a plate that is it you are able to gauge that response when you begin to have your action to have your response be conscious continuously consistently and begin to in that sense observe a contiguous positive result you will still create the idea of the unexpected you will still create the idea of surprise you will still create the idea that things come up that perhaps was not exactly what you had prepared for but every single instance of that particular idea things happening unexpectedly are then interpreted by you when you are willing to act in this way joyously ah I in acting who I am expected this to happen but this is coming up and said and because I know I am committed to who I am and my actions reflected this is blatantly more obviously beneficial for me than anything I had preconceived should happen now to allow me to express myself fully and thereby you begin to perceive and interpret unexpected circumstance and results in a very positive and anticipating way when you do that there is nothing that can seem to creep in there for everything is part of the process and not an interruption in it now as I have again often shared you already do this always about what we are discussing now is doing it consciously when I say you have already been doing this I mean you always decide this is who I am no matter what your criteria is you always trust in that decision till you change it and you always respond with that decision as a foundation so we are not discussing doing anything new perhaps the approach is new perhaps the purposefulness perhaps the focusing and maintaining a conscious focus of who you are may appear or feel new but you have always done this anyway and any result that you are experiencing is automatically the result of that approach which you have expressed so perfectly your whole entire life and if you wish to get technical your whole entire existence often responsibility in your reality can be negatively interpreted as blame I am responsible I am to blame that is one way to put it but that is not an empowering acknowledging self expressive way to understand and when you decide I am to blame you have made a decision built into that decision implicated by that decision is that you are negative person that you have done something wrong that you cannot change that you are a habitual being and therefore by extension that your actions are completely out of your control or maybe only partially in your control but you need not have blame as response able your ability to respond means no matter what you have done no matter who you have been you can choose yourself a new in any given moment and you can use that ability to respond positively if you have done something negative in your path that allows you through the fact that you know that is not representative of who you now choose to be to align to the positive idea of who you are and therefore nothing that you have done no matter how negative is extraneous everything that you have done can be used to reinforce a positive decision about who you are therefore response able responsible responsibility responsibility can be interpreted in the most empowered way which is you have full and complete command conscious command over what you put out in your life and whatever vibration you are being when you put something out is the result you seem to get back along this apparent ingredient now the actuality is that once you make the decision you are the vibration of that decision you are that person the appearance that you create is that you first must perform an action to cause the series of events to create the evidence of being that person using the appearance and beginning to act consciously and getting the results of those conscious actions begins to drive your consciousness back into what you call the moment the now moment the willingness to be who you are consciously to respond as that person and to begin to get the results of that person also have the effect of having your consciousness seem to slide back into the moment where you can begin to lift the apparent and begin to experience the actuality that when you merely make the decision the whole reality changes one of the ways in order to explain the apparent to you of the gradient is in a sense you play the game of proving what I am saying to yourself and once you have proven it you in a sense create yourself to be more completely expressive in the moment this is one of the ways that we endeavor to explain to you why there is still the appearance that you have the middle man or woman of action and you can use whatever the currency you create in a positive way because you may feel I do not have control over the people that I interact with I do not have control over having to pay the rent tomorrow and not having the money what do I have control over what you have again according to expressing yourself on this gradient is your response in any given moment from what is available for you to act upon and that is your door that is your key that is your missing link there is your puzzle piece that folk wrote that ability when you begin to express yourself in this way and notice initially that you still may perceive an event a circumstance a relationship in a negative way or perceive something and interpret it in a negative way you will understand through your willingness to withhold your action until you realize that no matter what you are thinking in that circumstance it is only the action that you perform that has the results and you will see that you can have an initial negative reaction and by being willing to have a positive action get a positive result even though you may seem to have a tendency to still create negative interpretation once you see in action that responding positively no matter what your initial interpretation is create the positive result you will immediately begin to see the transformation of your interpretation do not necessarily be so initially negative often individuals will judge themselves very harshly because their initial reaction interpretation of their perceived reality is negative but when you begin to again withhold your actions realign and have the actions be a positive expression you can see how that need not in any way holds you back and you create the evidence that because you are willing to act in a positive way those interpretations are no longer relevant those interpretations are dated stuff your willingness to act purposefully transforms your tendency to interpret your reality in a specific way and replaces your tendency to interpret your reality with a positive interpretation knowing that no matter what the reality seems to present you will only perform a positive action only get a positive result and therefore the circumstance in and of itself cannot be inherently negative and therefore the approach of initially labeling things negative melts away becomes completely irrelevant to the you that you are consciously expressing rather than simply entertaining when you begin to explore the idea of expanding your consciousness and creating consciously many of you entertain the possibility of that idea that your life can be a conscious expression but until your actions reflect that it is only nearly an entertainment when your actions reflect that and get the corresponding results you create the physical evidence that supports the idea that it is far beyond simply entertaining that you create your reality and that you are an infinite being expressing yourself in finite terms and when you are willing to gain your actions accordingly all the evidence becomes supportive of the positive decision rather than a reflection of indecision or a reflection of the appearance that your reality is a reactive event rather than a proactive event is it clear all right you don't sound too excited about it perhaps you have not yet graph the simplicity of what I am saying or perhaps you are still rather attached to the idea of random events random effects polarity experience that is all right that is all well and good for you over set your own pace and therefore nobody will rush you into exploring more of yourself nor can anyone slow you down when you decide to your willingness to grasp that though your reality is quite complex believing of yourself the expressing of yourself can be rather simple is a very useful idea when you begin to transform who you are for because you are always deciding I am this person I trust I am this person and my actions now will in that sense reflect express that person again we are not sharing with you something that you need to practice or something that you need to develop an expertise in you are all consummate experts at creating your own reality randomly congratulations however you do often attract interactions such as interactions with ourselves but any interactions that reflect your willingness to look beyond what you call the status quo because you are now ready to express more of yourself and so we are discussing most specifically what is meant by expression which is your response therefore by all means if it is attractive to you to express your reality in positive terms create the life that you prefer and desire by all means explore the idea that I am sharing with you using the facility you have already exercised and masterfully employed to sum it all up your willingness to gauge your response according to aligning with your most positive self is the profound approach along the gradients utilizing linear reality rather than attempting to transcend it in order to escape it in a very simple way purposely employing the idea of your conscious commandment this is who I am just because I know myself better than anyone else this is who I am therefore a person who is this person has a particular approach has a particular response and if you are willing to align to your most positive understanding of who you are you will find out just how creative you are in any given situation to respond in the most loving and positive way assuming assuming that what you choose to experience in your life is a loving and positive result perhaps some of you wish something else when you put out that action create that vibration of positivity of giving it of loving that that is what you get back and that is what many of you say you desire therefore when you see what seems to be coming back in your direction you can also use that to look at your actions not to assign blame not to judge yourself but simply to observe that perhaps maybe in certain given situations your response is not always reflective of your most empowered version of who you are and may in fact be perhaps just perhaps occasionally a bit disempowered once you realize what you are doing you can do something else or you can simply bypass the analysis and only do what it is that is representative of who you decide you are though we have broken this down decision trust and action into three components for the purposes of elucidating and explaining and defining the mechanism that you create your reality you will begin to find that they are truly one event the decision the trust is always expressed as the action and therefore the action while you are creating in this way is perhaps again the most important thing to be mindful of at this point to take the next step perhaps in many ways the final step of expanding your consciousness into expressing yourself in preferred terms according to your desire according to your excitement expressing your knowing this that everything is one integrated expression that is you for your willingness to allow me to interact with you I thank you and understand again by means of slightly clarifying that your response your action can also be the thing you say when you say something that is an action that is a response and because at least at this point in the way that you express yourself as physical beings you rely on verbal communication quite heavily what you say is representative of who you are being in that moment when we say gauge your response you can also choose to apply that response to what you say this is what we do as a matter of course everything is conscious and therefore the action that I would seem to perform in these interactions is quote unquote verbally and on the many levels that we create this interaction interact with it is the expression of who I am perhaps for now in the only form that you will allow yourself to see but I remind you that I only exist within you from your point of view and therefore anything that I say is something that you are now reflecting very consciously very blatantly back to yourself you get the credit and your willingness to use whatever external reflection you attract as an example of the way in which you can create your reality in a positive way is one of the creative ways that you attract what you call tools and resources not that what we are saying is any better than any other approach you have ever had or anything that you are doing we simply represent one of the reflections that you create from yourself to yourself that incorporates the idea of expanding into a more joyful expression of who you know yourself to be because at least for me from my part of this interaction that is what I represent a being who chooses joy a being who chooses full experience full committed expression positive output positive experience positive perception and interpretation and therefore whatever reflection that you attract which is only you speaking back to yourself in elaborately removed term by all means utilize that resource you will begin to find when you put this out almost every single direction will spit that back so to speak to you individuals may seem to change but it is truly you expressing yourself differently and therefore attracting the reflections that reinforce that support that reflection and that is why because this is the particular methodology through which linear reality expresses itself and you have chosen to explore the idea of linear reality action willingness to act consciously represents the fulcrum therefore for your willingness to interact with me I ask you now how by way of sharing between us we may mutually be of service and reflection to each other sharing female alone when I have lucid dream or I'm meditating begin again when I'm having a lucid dream or I'm meditating is there a way I could figure out the difference between a future probability in this timeline versus another one so that I could be act more appropriately the idea is to be spontaneous in the moment rather than need to prepare the idea of preparation is a rigid approach that does not allow for the unexpected to come to your age does not allow for the unexpected to actually be the shortest shall I say point or path between two points so if you feel the need to prepare by all means that is one methodology through which you can do that but because one of the ideas you are very strongly choosing to buy into is the unexpected being in a way or in that way a joy reminder a joyous reflection of another possibility that that may be counterproductive in that way do you understand what I am saying yes I do now also understand that when you need to know when that will be the most conducive thing once you are expressing yourself consistently consciously then it will simply be absolutely evident this particular meditation this lucid dream represents absolutely to me the fulcrum through which I will align my consciousness and then approach it will serve that purpose no matter what then comes up if you are willing if something should come up that is unexpected to still use that and not so rigidly insist that it must be any particular way thank you for clearing it up sharing yes my you can share with the group today some of your personal memories or if they are made historical accounts of your own civilizations transformation from third and fourth destiny well briefly not to put it out but there are many things to discuss this evening our particular approach never started out being quite as removed from the idea of ourselves as your own so therefore it would seem from your perspective that there was less to transport we already flowed in that sense in tandem in alignment basically speaking with perhaps what you might refer to as the nature upon our planet the approach and interactions of the interpersonal relationships of our people how it did play out because of the fact that there was very little removal already is that our transformation basically did last what you might consider to be but three days and again the appearance he may be that we fell asleep and woke up as a mass as a society but the idea is that that was simply again in alignment with our already existing tendency to express ourselves slightly less removed in that sense does that answer the question so you already had an understanding of the connection to the whole and there wasn't as much separation of the self hey but there still was some idea of perhaps you can say slightly more separated idea but perhaps if you were to understand our consciousness previous to what you would call our transformation or our math transformation it would be similar to many of the ancient peoples upon your planet that existed in harmony with the nature of your planet the transformation in many ways represented the idea of going to the next level which then also allowed us to explore and express even physically perhaps what you might refer to as more advanced technology but never was our idea of technology separate from nature for we understand ourselves to be an expression of nature and therefore anything that we express also by extension by definition must also be nature. What is much of a quantum leap of consciousness changing of technologies ability all of a sudden to be able to manipulate time and space in a much more profound manner than prior to the world and still quite shall I say seeming to create new possibilities where possibilities did not exist before. Not really not. Any individual that would create such an idea of resistance would simply create an offshoot parallel reality and we would not seem to interact with them to be aware that they made a different decision. What we were going through. What we were going through. Hey, absolutely. I just want to ask you, I just want to know what you were going through. There was what you call understanding. There was to some degree what you would seem to interpret as an expectancy and event and then the idea of perhaps you can say an unleashing of more of ourselves. Now, this is not truly even though I have defined it in these terms that much different from how you also transform. But the idea is because our mass approach was more similar and your mass approach is more diverse. It seems as though it is a greater transformation to you. And from our point of view, it was just as marvelous, wonderful and may I say advantageous. That is obviously your decision. And should you continue to maintain that decision and express it through action, then yes, I will concur. But should you perhaps decide to express yourself for only three days? That is why I mention that number and that is why there is the commonality of that number. You can see what I am saying in no uncertain terms. And perhaps one of the only differences in acceptability is that because of the way that you have created your own selves in this sense, because of the degree of removal that you sometimes perceive that you have created, three weeks would seem to be more representative of what would be a crux for a personal individual. But three days, immediate and obvious physical events are in place that allow you to as you sometimes refer to it create a momentum. Though again, that is an apparently. All right? All right, congratulations. Next sharing. I already do, but shared with everyone else by all means. At one time I was diagnosed as an alcoholic. Someone could not stop drinking once they start drinking. And I will come one morning and I said, you know, I don't like that. I will no longer be an alcoholic. You mean to tell me you changed your decision? How risky? I didn't say I was never drinking yet. I said I would never be drunk again. Ball run? Same thing. Boy. I'm going back to that because I like to transform more by some. Well by all means go ahead. It was so simple and so easy just to say that and then to do that. So you have already had somewhat you call experience proving to yourself so to speak that simplicity is an option. Yes. All right. Can you then see how what we have discussed would apply to your situation now? If you simply trust who you are and gauge your actions accordingly rather than say I am this person and for some percentage of the time have your actions reflect that and then other times say I am this person but yet your actions reflect a more disempowered interpretation then you can do exactly what you are saying across the board of your life rather than in one specialized area. That is all there is to it. Now again to simply gauge you to your own specific vernacular trusting your intuition but not saying you trust your intuition acting as though you trust it. Do you see what I mean? Yes. Oh, are you willing in that sense to do that? Are you willing to be to respond? Only according to your most positive representation of who you are no matter what your interpretation is in any given moment. Be willing to withhold your action until you are realigned. All right. Then I will see you sooner than you might imagine. That coincides with my dream last time. Oh, what an accident. Oh, I have a minute. No accident. All right. Do you proceed? I was the dream was I was going to go into the turn fight and I missed the turn to go south. Ah, unexpected circumstance. Proceed. What did you do? Well, I had this. I did it three times. I realized load out of it so you can make the turn where you want to go. Ah, thank you. You have your foot on the accelerator of your life. And sometimes again, to utilize the examples, putting on the brakes before you make the turn, it may be the only way to realign with where it is you know you wish to be. Thank you very much. Nice talking with you again. Always. I thank you as well. And remind you, you have done it all. You're willing to have your actions reflect, your desires, your ideas, your inspiration. Then have your actions be your expirations as well. I thank you. Hey, it's my. Great names. And to you. And my good day. All of you guys. All right. How about the women? Yeah. All right. A couple of years ago, you gave us something called the harmonic wave template, which relates to the idea of planetary transformation. All right. Yours only took three days, which was pretty quick. So, and yours as I have shared, if you are willing to commit to it and not rely upon the necessity that everyone else do the same. Your transformation wasn't tandem because our civilization function more cohesively. But this is not a weakness of your society. The advantage is that you can do so personally, and then you will create the apparently or the idea that so has everyone else, rather than relying on the company, so to speak. Do proceed. Well, I'm very interested in the idea you expressed us before called template metaphysics, where the harmonic wave template plots out how third density planets such as ours go through their transformational phase, where they encircle on the old game in order to start a new game. And this harmonic wave template plots out in 80 years, cycle complete with trigger points and cultural events in the symbolic cultural events in our culture. The first one was back in 1947, and the symbolic event was the Roswell crash. And then in 1967 we had Star Trek came out, where we started to get used to our extra truss. And then in 1987 we had the harmonic convergence as we labeled it, or the midpoint convergence, which was sort of like at the midpoint of this 80 year cycle. And now here we are approaching 1997, which I've sort of dubbed the cyberspace convention, the cyberspace convergence. Oh, what? Where we're all getting together on the internet and sort of converging as harmoniously as we can. And then the whole template would then in 2017 you gave what you called the harmonic identification. All right. Now I have to have a question before you proceed. Do understand that many of these explanations were very specific. They were specifically geared to allow people to turn keys, open up doors, expand their acceptability of expressing themselves in more empowered terms. Many individuals require steps, processes, explanations. Do you desire? You personally, I am asking now, so your answer can be representative of who you are to wait till that year to have that effect. I'm all for transforming now. All right. Go right ahead. Thank you. I will. I'm part of that symbolic thing for me. By the way, before you proceed again, that is a societal tendency. And as I have reminded you about the idea of predictions, which are simply a sensing of the energy that is present in the moment of what is most likely to occur if things stay according to that seeming path that nearly the sharing of the prediction, nearly the introduction of the idea generally will serve to change the outcome. So therefore, that is still a tendency, a possibility. But it is not necessary by any means that your experience needs follow any particular template. And when you are willing to transform, all bets are off in any particular template, which was situation specific to something which may no longer be representative of who you are being. Do you understand? Yes. So by all means, use the tool, particularly if you wish to prolong yourself that long. Or if it is the methodology through which you feel you can communicate with other individuals, by all means, you can have them in agreement to take that long as well. Or you can simply use the inspiration that you derive from any tool, including that one, and create that now. And again, in terms of that schedule, all bets are off. And that template becomes less relevant to you and the expression of your reality. Still, it will be relevant to another reality. You need not worry. Thank you. My decision is to wake up now. All right. And I like to pull around with templates and things that you say. All right. Do you understand that many of these templates create more time, which is all well and good. I am not saying there are any should as to when you might wish to express more of yourself. I am simply pointing out that if you fixate on an idea that is linearly dependent, you can fulfill your own prophecy in a way that may not completely be representative of your truest desire to express yourself right now. I got it. Is that all? Yes. Thank you. All right. You're right. You're right. You're right. All right. I'm going to go ahead. What is the reason for choosing a biological unit that we represent? All right. Apparently you have one of the dookies. It is simply one expression through which you can experience your reality in a very specific, what you sometimes call sensorial way. It is a way to express yourself that puts in certain variables that allow you once again to explore, to seem, to grow, to learn, to experience. And this is very key things as if it were the first time. Or as I have often stated, when you are all knowing, all seeing infinite beings, there is no idea of first time. Everything already exists. And so one way to understand it without getting that complicated is that the idea of surprise is irrelevant. The idea of learning is irrelevant. The idea of the joy of discovering is irrelevant because you already know it all. So that is the most basic common denominator idea as to why you choose this particular form. Now, whatever else occurs to you in addition to that can be your specific reason. But does that make sense? To a certain degree it does make sense. Why did you choose your form? What was the compelling force for you to choose who you became and what was the compelling force for me to choose who I had become? Well, you answered the question as far as you're concerned. And if you are willing to take responsibility, you can simply do so. I will answer from my end, simply that the particular physical form that I am expressing for what to me is right now is the most conducive to allow me to explore, to discover in a way that I can express myself most fully. Now, really this is a trick question because it's the same answer for you two. That's exactly what I'm trying to do that. Ah, well, when you stop trying to do it and simply do it, that is the difference between gauging your response and reacting. Thank you for reminding me of that. All right. Thank you for reminding yourself and using me as an excuse. Is that all? Yeah, that's clear. But we will pause for a short break of 10 to 15 minutes of your counting and resume in contact with the other dooker at that time.
