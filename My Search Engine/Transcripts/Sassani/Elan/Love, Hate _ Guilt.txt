 Greetings this evening of your time as you... how are you all? Oh thank you. Allow me to begin by saying that this is my first interaction on your planet since Egypt as well and I am quite excited about it. So understand that you have had perhaps somewhat publicized of the many energy gates in your society what you call 1111. Allow me to again express my joy at sharing with you 1212. We shall entitle this interaction, love, hate and guilt. Now as you know there are many forms of love upon your planet in that you express shall we say many separations in the concept you call love. For our particular shall we say discourse and explanation we will simply utilize two expressions of love that is conditional and unconditional love. Unconditional love is exactly that. That would directly correspond to love which has no conditions placed upon it and is automatic ever flowing. Ever existing cannot be withdrawn for there are simply no conditions that need be fulfilled for the giving and sharing of that love. This is indeed the love of what you call God or what we call all that is itself. In fact perhaps more apropos is the idea that all that is is unconditional love itself and therefore cannot judge does not contain the concept of judgment which is the imposition of conditions which when not met in a sense the withdrawal of love results. Therefore you may understand that when you feel what you call judgment you are never feeling it from all that is that is simply impossible. What you are feeling is your own created version of standards which when not met then results in that sense through the withdrawal of health love. Therefore understand that as you contain the concept of conditional self love itself you also contain the concept of unconditional self love and many times simply this being pointed out will allow you to begin if you wish to see when you are imposing conditions and when you are willing to love yourself completely unconditionally for the idea is that because all that is loves you unconditionally and this is constant this is never changing that energy can always be tapped into and matched within yourself for again it is constant and you can simply in remembering in realizing that that unconditional love exists mimic that self love in a sense you may say simply refusing to withdraw your self love which you have in that sense earned. Therefore you can be willing to not settle for any less than loving yourself but you do contain within your society the idea you call conditional love and when you are expressing conditional love to individuals basically you are loving them when they meet your condition or when you feel that they fulfill your standards this is not again exactly what you would call the love of all that is and is perhaps one of the more unique creations of your society in being able to express within the unconditional love of all that is itself condition when individuals in that sense do not meet your conditions many times still feeling a sense of self love still feeling a sense of deserve ability you will create an emotion a polarized expression of conditional love you call hate and many times individuals will say well hate is the opposite of love in a sense this is true from the perspective of conditional love but not from the perspective of unconditional love for again unconditional love of self results in what you would call the expression of deserve ability and if you feel deserving but feel that someone has not met your conditions you express this as hate and what you call hate in order to become so righteously indignant about it does still contain some feeling of deserve ability so therefore if you have any expression of self love that in a sense would then not be the true opposite of unconditional love it would be a polarized expression of unconditional love guilt however is the true opposite of unconditional love for when you are expressing guilt you are not realizing and acknowledging your creatorhood you are not realizing and acknowledging your deserve ability your ability to understand that you deserve to exist and you deserve to create a life of joy and ecstasy so in that sense guilt is the complete withdrawal of unconditional self love and therefore is the opposite of love itself when you feel this many times individuals will ascribe that it is a positive feeling for in that sense it controls you or shall we say holds the reins from you doing things that are out of integrity but understand this is not using your creations in the most positive of way you need not withdraw self love when you do not meet your condition and have that be a form in that sense of positive self reflection for when you withdraw that self love you are no longer in the centered position to shall we say transform your creations according to preference and in that sense you create a sense of perceived helplessness through which you then create paralysis that paralysis does not allow you once again to transform so when you feel what you call guilt you may use that as well as a reminder that in the moment you are creating that you are not unconditionally loving yourself and once you realize that you are not then you put yourself back in the pivotal position to decide whether you wish to or not whether again after all you have accomplished and learned whether you will settle for anything less than your complete unconditional self love if you do something that you do not prefer and that you find most out of your integrity guilt again introduces a paralysis to transform it acknowledgement allows you to transform it by perhaps again realizing that what I have just done is not within myself or sense of self integrity therefore I understand that the feeling that I am generating tells me this and therefore I realize that should a similar set of circumstances come along I will now use the fact that I have done this unpreferred thing as evidence that next time I will not and when and it always will you will always create a similar situation comes along you will then have the opportunity in not doing that thing to create what you call balance there is the assumption that if you do something out of your integrity that your karmic balance must come in the form of retribution and obviously I need not tell you that this is one way that you can create the balance but another way to create the balance is again to acknowledge that what you have done is not a representation of who you choose to be and when you attract again which you will this is an exploration a similar set of circumstances and then do not do that thing that you feel is out of your integrity you have established balance in no uncertain turn you have allowed yourself to act as a creator creating feedback from your reality and using that feedback with a foundational unconditional self love to transform into a preferential expression is it clear is it clear to more than one oh what when we exchange we will allow for clarification of specifics but again the point is this you always have the option you always have the opportunity to not place conditions on your self love again all that is loves you unconditionally and this can always be tapped into for it is not something whichever changes it is constant the reminder that it is constant is all that it takes to drum up the vibration of that feeling that I am loved no matter what if all that is if God loves me no matter what do I not deserve to treat myself with the same respect if you remove the conditions of your love you will use all your creations in a positive way you will understand that the negative creations are results of unconsciously bought into beliefs and that by allowing them to come up they become conscious if you deny a creation you talk it back into what you call your subconscious if you acknowledge it you allow yourself the opportunity to transform and change it again you cannot get rid of a belief that you do not in that sense prefer for there is nowhere to put it you are the entire universe you can however transform it but again only by putting it out on the table and acknowledgement of an unpreferred belief puts it on the table denial sticks it back in again perhaps what we can call the subconscious closet once your choices are before you on again colloquially speaking the table you then have equal access to them if you talk the things you do not prefer about yourself in the closet you do not have equal access you have surrounded and isolated the things you do not prefer and taking them out of your reach unconditional self love is the willingness to use all your creations even the ones that appear negative and once again we remind you what we have called the wild card that you can always use any any any creation in a positive way by simply asking yourself after perhaps you ascribe the more obvious everyone knows societal negative label how does this serve me exactly the way it is this question is what we call the wild card where you can always pull it out and it always then completes your death complete your hand therefore to allow for interchange and to allow for clarification of any specifics that may arise from this particular explanation we will proceed to the inter action though before we do allow me to once again and yet for the first time thank you all for your willingness to begin to act as a creator this generally in your society will begin on a conceptual level as you create these separations but understand that the having of the idea is in that moment the same as the being of the idea so once you realize that it is a concept yourself empower yourself in the moment you realize that at least for that moment you are that idea very often you will then create separations between yourself and that idea but simply in bringing it up again as a concept you become the idea whenever you bring anything up as a concept in order to do so you are the idea itself in the moment you are bringing it up so it is very simple in that sense to become anything you wish if you no longer draw the separation well I mentally know that but how does that apply when you mentally know it you are it in that moment if you choose to continue to be that you will get that effect if you choose after drumming it up and being it to then create separations that it was just a concept then you get that effect but it is all up to you and always will be and it brings us great joy and the only thing in fact that allows us the opportunity to interact with you is the concept that you are now willing to entertain these notions not only as a concept but as an action in your life or as physical beings in the physical world the actions represent your ultimate willingness to state to the universe in no uncertain terms that this is who I am you very often in that sense will say well I just believe this but it is your actions that are the ultimate statement of your belief therefore you can always trace back from the actions to the beliefs but you can also establish actions that would correspond to a preferred belief and simply begin to act that way going perhaps a bit backwards how would a person who has the belief that I wish to have act use your imagination to conjure that up and simply again act that way for again actions or the ultimate manifestation and statement to the universe that I believe this at least in a physical world and that is what we are discussing with you now being that your choice for now is physicality I thank you and ask you how we may mutually be of service to each other shedding. Hey. Greetings. How are you? Perfect. As you all are. Yeah. Well this is the whole subject really struck a chord with me. Always like to play around. Yeah I'm wondering why you chose that I guess I know the answer. Well in a sense it simply applies to all and in that sense will allow for many doors to be open within you in beginning to exercise so to speak into action unconditional self love you are worth and you are beginning to explore that maybe you just are therefore it is the timing. Yeah it just I'm kind of paralyzed now because that's such a big issue for me and self guilt you know feeling guilty about others is one thing but having guilt about your own actions isn't that two things those are two separate things. Well they are under one blanket category for the idea is the guilt while you are creating it is not an expression of self love the willingness to use the guilt to re align yourself with the self love then shall we say create a flow and freeze you up from what you are calling the pariah. So rather than being guilty about being guilty you can now begin to be joyous that you notice that you are guilty that you acknowledge it and that you remind or remember that that guilt is not an expression of self love once you know you are imposing condition then you can decide not to impose that when you are simply automatic you do not allow yourself awareness that you are imposing them to begin. Okay so if one has self guilt about an issue first thing to do is to be aware of it right. Okay so if you are aware of it and you can turn it back I don't understand what is the next step. The next step is to say what have I done that I would prefer to not have done. All right I have done this. Well I cannot undo that however should a similar circumstance come along I will use the fact that all right creating much misery around having made that choice I will not make that choice again. That is all. Just willing to have that resolve and saying perhaps let me add it in terms of creating it again and not doing that can begin to turn you again on a folk room toward again realigning with self love. Does that make sense? Yes. And again I will assume it to be private that you are feeling guilty about. Can you see that given a similar set of circumstances your actions would now be different? There is many guilt issues in my life. Well one at a time the point is given the opportunity to have a similar set of circumstances would you now be willing to use that to do something else. The guilt is like the time. Answer the question. Would you be willing under a similar set of circumstances to any one of the issues to now do something else since you know how it felt to have done the thing you feel was out of your integrity. Yes or no. Yes. You are in that. Now simply go about your life and when perhaps if it comes along again do what you are saying remind yourself then you have used that creation the guilt itself then you are treating yourself with unconditional love. Your willingness to even say next time if there is one I will not do that again is all you need to and knowing this you now know who you are and you are doing the only thing that is available to you rather than shall we say lamenting about something you quote unquote cannot change in the past. So from what you have said to me you have created the battle now simply be willing if again a situation comes along similar to prove to yourself and perhaps the universe by extension that you really mean that and you will give yourself in many of these instances the opportunity to create a similar set of circumstances and then you will see experience. Not only what I mean but it begins as an idea it begins as the willingness to understand that judgment is the imposition of condition that what you call forgiveness is the willingness to once again be on condition. Does that connect? Definitely connected. Do you wish to proceed? Or do you wish to sit with it and perhaps see what comes up or there will be others who will share many of your sentiments. Realize that you are well even if you choose to despise and hate and destroy so to speak yourself all that is will sit by unconditionally loving you through the past and in fact although it sounds like an irony it is the unconditional love of all that is itself that allows you to not unconditionally love yourself. For there are no conditions you may explore anything you wish. This is the granting of complete free will. This is the granting of complete unconditional love. Never will you lose that love. Now we are speaking again about creating shall we say treating yourself with that same respect. I think my biggest issue is something that has been ingrained in me. Or ingrained? Yes. In childhood. Therefore perhaps you can say a choice that has come up many times and you have bought into. Yeah. Do you wish to share? In the large part of my life. Do you wish to share? Perhaps you can utilize it as a transformative example. Okay. I think guilt in my mother's death. In what way did you physically kill her? No. Oh. In what way? And even if you had you would create an opportunity to kill someone else and then perhaps not do it. But in what way are you perceiving for it is our perception that it is not shall we say part of her perspective. What way are you perceiving that you have responsibility for rather than to her death? Well I had a large. I felt them. I grew into a large and to our role of large responsibility to her and her health and I feel that through that period I was responsible. Oh. So then you prolonged her life in that sense is that what you were saying? I'm saying that I didn't have any. Take your time. Yeah. Or make your time. It's just I feel responsible for her death like I didn't take good enough care of her. Can you have done anything? No. What is the point of beating yourself up like this? I don't know. No that you have done the best you can. Then you have been fully responsible to her. She has been responsible for herself for her timing for her agreement. Now can you release this and allow her the same respect in creating her own reality as you are now viewing of respect of yourself for creating your own? Our perception is fully that you have been responsible to her to the best of your ability. So what are you creating as an obstacle to believing this? I don't know. I just don't know. Well first of all you do know. So assuming that you do now what comes up? You're getting. He goes follow the script. I don't know. Nurturing comes up for me. Responsibilities for nurturing. Well as you have shared you had done that to the best of your ability. You had perhaps increased the quality of the end of her life. Is this correct? I think so. Oh. I'm not sure on that because it was painful. In what? I think it was painful for her and it was painful for me. What is it that was painful? The lifestyle that we led at that time. Do you acknowledge your own creation of your reality? Yes or no? Yes. Do you acknowledge her creation of her reality? Yes or no? Yes. Do you understand that doing all that you can do to be responsible to her is the only way that you can express your creation of your reality and also allow her the same right? Yes or no? Yes. Therefore are you going to continue to be responsible for her choices as well? Yes or no? Can you really even be responsible for her? No I can't. Oh. Are you willing to release this feeling? Yes. Are you willing in a similar set of circumstances to once again do the best that you can but still allow the granting of the validity to their choices and their creation as well? Yes or no? Yes. You have transformed this idea. Now how does that feel? It feels renewing and I'm aware of that. It just keeps coming back. No no no. That is not what is coming back. When you say it is coming back and you think about it what do you feel? The memory of that? What do you feel emotionally? Happiness, sadness, anger. I feel a heavy weight of a burden. Now healing this weight, feel it. Can you conjure it up? You are this weight. Yes. What must you believe? Right now under the specific set of circumstances that we are discussing to feel this weight. Go with it. Say the first thing that comes to your mind without any hesitation. I'm carrying the responsibility of her death. Is that the belief? That's what I feel. Oh. Now you have seen that believing this has these feelings and when you believe and feel something you create thought patterns and then you act that way. Yes. Perhaps that is a contracted action with hesitation. Yes. Now what is the preferred belief that you wish to have? That I release and I let go and I let her let her die. Close your eyes. Now let's make the leap. All right. Are you willing to play? Uh huh. I'll play. Oh. Stay blind. You can still have some fun and transform this at the same time. Okay. Thank you. To yourself, the preferred belief until you feel it and describe for me the feeling. Do not allow the old belief to create in there for the purposes of this game. All right. Okay. Save the new belief. Allowed or to yourself it does not matter but when you feel it until you feel it and then describe that feeling to me. Could you help me phrase the belief? I'm not clear on what I'm trying to phrase. Oh, in a sense I will allow you to do so but I will assist. What is for one moment put this aside? The again non preferred belief that you are responsible for your mother's death. Oh, what is the reciprocal of this belief? And I'm not responsible for her death and that it was a- And you are fully responsible to her. Now stay fifth and tell me how this feels. I tell it from all other beliefs for the moment. And keep saying it to yourself to you. Feel it. You have all the time you need. Well, I'll say it out loud. I released the responsibility of her death and I let her go on it. It is her choice. Are your eyes still closed? Yes. How does it feel? It feels good to affirm it. Then continue to affirm it within yourself until you build an intensity of this good feeling and describe that good feeling to me. It feels good to release just to see her go. How does it feel? Do not describe the circumstance described the feeling in your heart. I don't think I want to let go. Oh, well do understand that will always be your option. And your want factor into this. Perhaps you may wish to explore what you have invested in holding onto it. Is that obvious? Yes. Do you have invested in holding onto it? What do you get out of maintaining that feeling? I don't think a lot of positive things. Specifically. What does it allow you to do? It's an important excuse to allow you to create. I don't feel sorry for myself or some sort of self nurturing, you know, from not for myself or something. That is not what you are getting out of it. What do you get out of it? What does it allow you to do to hold onto a belief such as this that you do not prefer? Look at it from that perspective. Does it allow you to not do things? Does it allow you the excuse to remain stagnant? What are you afraid will happen if you do things? That perhaps I could fail such as all. Now we are getting down. May I ask you a question? If you fail, so what? What will happen? No. Well, what do you imagine will happen? I just know that if I fail, it's okay. I still would exist. May I ask you a question? Yes. What has failed you, please? I guess judgments of the fathers around me. May I provide my perspective of what failure is? Not maintaining your clear intention period, allowing your reality to talk you out of your clear intention. For if something happens or does not happen in a given moment, it is always still an option as we have discussed to maintain it as an intention and maintaining it as an intention keeps it locked into place, keeps it right there as something you will do. I intend to do this. The moment you sell yourself short and release the intention using a circumstance in the present as evidence that you can't have it, then perhaps you can label it as a form of failure. Are you willing, no matter what happens in a given moment, to maintain your clear intention that you can never pay? And you will always re-ground yourself back into the moment by saying, all right, I intended to do this. It is not happening in this moment. Therefore, this is not the moment for it to happen. However, I still intend to do this. I will put it aside as an intention. Now that that is out of the way, what is right in front of me, this, this and that, which one excites me? This? Can I act on it with integrity? Yes, you are now back in motion. You now have overcome social-speak the paralysis. And by maintaining it as a clear intention, there is no such thing as failure. Does this make sense? Are you willing to do that? Do you now still have an investment in holding on to the feeling that you need to be responsible for your mother? No, I see no need. Oh, it is this. Maintain your clear intention. Align yourself with your desires. Understand your ability to deserve. Be clear with your definitions and beliefs and perform clear action from what is available, maintaining the clear intention if that intention is not available. You can never fail with this form. It is the first thing that ever came through this channel and it will continue to come through. Therefore, it is the key to consciously creating according to purpose, clear intention, clear desire, deserve-ability, definition and clear action. I-3D-A. Now allow this to roll around. We will proceed to interacting with others. Open up, they as well as you are sharing in this exploration. The presence of each and every one is no accident. If you will begin to concentrate on your similarities rather than your differences, this will become most apparent. If as we are going along something comes up, please share again. Such has been said, allow it to sink in and maintain your clear intention. You will then never fail. Thank you very much. And thank yourself. If you will, understanding that this applies to each and every one of you as well, applaud this individual for his courage. Again understand you are applauding yourself that well. Therefore again we will proceed, but again remember that if clarification is requested, button as you say. Say, hey, straight in, oh travel of the night. It's really good to be with you for the first time again now. And to sense you ever. Though we have such faith. Oh yes, Lon just returning from Egypt as you mentioned. Before you proceed, how do you know it's that you brought a piece back with you? I brought a lot back with you. You can never lose it. Yes, I realized that I was back in Egypt again, not there the first time. You all were. Yeah, they say once you drink from the Nile, you must be turned to Egypt. And I guess it's true. It took me about 5,000 years. I suppose. But I made it. That is not precise, but we will allow it to fly about it. Would you like to give a more precise date or more precise thing? It is our sense thing that shall we say you have touch faced several times. Therefore proceed with your concept and perhaps that will unfold as to the specific. The long the whole trip was an eye opener. Sometimes I feel like I would be opened up with a can opener. Well, when you open your third eye with an insistence to keep it shut on some level, yes, it can appear that way. A particular significance was my visit to the temple of Hathaar and is in Dara. What did you see? What did you find? I walked in, I got hit with a pressure in the chest like you feel when you're seeing an old friend that you've missed so much that you haven't allowed yourself to realize how much you missed them. Well, in a sense there are also overtones of perhaps having been killed in that area as much. I see in the temple itself. I see. With what you would call projectile to the home. I see. Was that a well, what was my role at the time? Well, understand again that you have had several encounters with this in this particular instance. Perhaps you can say tea. I was a bit. And you perhaps got what you felt you deserved. Was I a good tea? Exactly. I was a scumbag. Perhaps you can say you felt both ways about yourself. I see. Well, I hope for somewhat of a more large issue. Because it's relatively more recent. However, the heart energy shall we say in previous reincarnation was of a positive resonance with the area of vibration where you were shall we say perhaps you can say somewhat royal in your presentation. Do proceed. Again, it will unfold. In Egypt was I primarily involved in politics, being a physician or being a priest. May I ask what is the difference? I've done a lot. Well, in a sense, yes. It was dendera and a couple of that for specifically significant and if so how? Many ways, but one will be a direct extra terrestrial connection. I see. Please. Yes. Was I a preserve politician or physician at the time with that occurrence? Perhaps in that occurrence you would consider again you to have primarily been priestly, but therefore then expressing the other two aspects as well. I see. Generally in the temples that I visited, I would find my attention very much absorbed with the main chambers and I take a great number of photographs. When I walked into Hutsore, I got hit very part of the chest, almost choked up, close to tears and I took a couple of pictures in the main hall and then found myself, rather than proceeding through the temple, I found myself going off into side doors and upstairs ways and downstairs ways and I found grips that other members of the group did not find. Well, the idea is that you were perhaps you can say revisiting an old house. It was like I wanted to check out all my old favorite spots because this is where I would stick things and hide things and find things. Some of which you, so to speak, came back to later. I see. Therefore again, integrity on the one hand and well, perhaps we will not use your term on the other. May I ask during this time is it's beef? Were my motivations primarily selfish or? Well, again, both it was perhaps an unconscious recognition that some of these things were yours on from level, but again understanding that thievery was by your own standard out of integrity as well. So perhaps again, a confusion, a contradiction in understanding was I violating a cross to someone who put in me at the time? Not necessarily. Again, perhaps your own sense of integrity. You were violating what was perceived to be by the guards of trust, yes? Hence your swift deliverance of effect. I see. I'm very interested. Was that because I feel the pain of the law of the atticle being? Repeat. Well, it seems like you get just about anywhere easier for right now if you stay on the guard. Is that what? No. I see. Then it was a big function that a higher level of accountability. Yes. Good way to put it. I see. It seemed to me that it was something that had tore, that I wanted to find. And I'm not sure if I did find it. I did find it rather. And it was primarily an energetic type of thing. Or if there's something physical that I was looking for and it's not yet time to have that in my possession. You may understand that it is both. You may understand that there is no need to physically have it in your possession in this life. And you may understand it to relate with what you would call amulec. With a particular, shall we say, red crystalline stone within it. Of the Indian origin? Connection. Of what art is this? Egyptian or extraterrestrial? What we are speaking of now would be Egyptian, but again, a connection to extraterrestrial source. A symbol of the union. A symbol of the communion in that sense. A very strong and powerful symbol of, again, perhaps one of your more blatant extraterrestrial interactions. Physically of the many carnations that you have expressed to yourself at. Is that ambulance physically present at Het's lore or somewhere else? One moment. It is not immediately evident. Meaning that I need not know. Meaning that you will discover as you need it. But there is a sense that it is not in what you would call music. It is not in the New Zealand. It is still a sph and again, most strongly understand that energetically connecting with it at this point understanding your creatorhood will achieve the same effect as physically and it may simply not be necessary to physically do so. But in that sense invoking it within your imagination and connecting with how it allows you to feel you will establish a very strong connection. Do you describe the shape of the Samuel? Help me focus a little bit more effectively on it. We will allow you to do so and describe it to me. Close your eyes. Take three deep breaths. Clear the deep, rich, red, transparent you of a multifaceted stone that is not as you say flat within bevel but is raved in its magnific. To a metallic substance you call gold and allow your imagination to then describe to me its shape and time. Do you see it as simply one triangle or do you understand it to be interesting? I think so much as to our David. Thank you. Love a clear sentence. May I also understand though your connection with me within what you would call Egyptian shall we say frame of breath that it is far more ancient than that. I was looking at the triangle and all of a sudden the triangle there was a dynamic motion and one triangle pointed up and one triangle pointed down intersecting creating the star of David but not in a static sense. In a static it appears as a triangle. I energetically perhaps but understand that it would correspond to being placed upon perhaps you can say a base that would be what you call tectonic. Do you see it? I guess this symbol you know you mean the end of the self place on a base. What you would call star as you have said is rained upon a flat base that is what you call tectonic thereby allowing each of the point to touch one of the shall we say angles of the hectic is translating out of the. I have to be the whole thing. Oh, the idea is that what was important and prominent was called force in your imagination showing you in no uncertain terms you have the ability to connect. Certainly we will continue to clarify. My sense is that the ambulance itself does not so much contain inherent power as much as it awakens remembrance and knowledge in the perceiver. You can understand that you have graduated from the. For back then you did place much of the power in the symbol and this is the distance now you understand the power reside within yourself as it does within all of you and that you imbue and allow a symbol to reflect that group reflect that power but you contain the power hence you do not need the symbol any longer though again connecting with it may open up many emotional doors which now allow you to function as a whole by. Not needing. Is it appropriate appropriate for me to really follow my. Say a moment to moment rather than pursue the acquisition of the Samuel. Now. I almost had absolutely not. But we will allow that to as you say. Let me rephrase the question. Oh, he was suing my excitement. He wanted very close. Watch the way he was raised. He's experiencing my excitement moments a moment within every is it likely that I'll set about a direct quest for this and you have to get not physically but energetic how it allows you to feel how it allows you to feel as though you can. Your self is no longer requiring the physical. Your highest degree of likelihood of attraction. Power is by forgetting completely about. Is the position of importance to anyone. Well, the general yes for again the placing of the power externally on a pinhole. So that still have that power that external placing of the power. It's but it is perhaps again now ironically sent by up that not necessarily those in possession of. Is it in someone's possession at this time? There is some shall we see degree of likelihood of. Are they aware of what is that they are possessive? What I have just said is not. And you said that it's the easiest that this time. Do you have a clear sense of where it is? If I may continue by the way. You can and that said in being willing to recreate have shall we say a record of control and then utilize that as a reflection tool. But please please please understand where the power lies and if it brings you joy and excitement to yourself as a reflection by all me. But if you are going to use it to create the power you are missing the point. I see. Since you brought that up as an option the goal of what caret standard is. The only translation that we can render is of being shall we say highest purity available that will still maintain a degree of what you call pardon. So what material is it? It would correspond to what is now referred to now as. I see. Now you can correspond to. Then was it a different mineral? Perhaps not. But again that is your contemporary lady. I see. But all the materials were of terrestrial origin. Is that true? And a very shall we say clear transparent. It was in extraterrestrial possession for time. That is the connection. What was their purpose in possessing it? You tell me. They programmed it. In a sense. In a sense. Again they understand the meaning of symmetry and allow it to be provided as an external symbol. It is quite symbolic and in a sense arbitrary in that way. But there was much value placed upon it at that time to do that and that was understood. I see. They took it to give it back energized or imbued with a power that was a very high seat held in very high seat. It never gets by the decrease in those who were drawn to power. In a sense. In a sense. The power itself was merely conceptual. The idea was they merely took it and returned it and all the labels and significance were then added by members of the US. And it was up to us that this was the. Alright so it always was an external symbol but not inherently a source of power. Everything. I see that now. Not an all thing but I see it in this thing. Well perhaps you can expand your vision to encompass it all. When have you done it? Yes I see it right now. Oh that's all it is. It is. If you allow it to be. I allow it to be. Oh. Elana here very strong sense as I was moving from temple to temple and experience that I was cataloging really experiencing things at one level to have deeper levels and dimensions of meeting of significance reveal themselves in time. I feel complete with the trip in Egypt and I love. I love the Egyptian people. It's definitely third world but there's not a friendlier and a more good hearted and well intentioned people that I've ever met. You will but I understand. There are many many people. Such as. And your willingness to vibrate with how that allows you to feel and bring that back will allow you to see that you need more further than your own back. Or always this within your immediate vicinity. Free out and it's simply a matter of what you choose to vibrate as therefore attract from the soup or menu of what the baby. So your willingness to express what you have brought back in those terms will attract from your immediate surrounding that same exact. That same exact. If you do not make the separation and understand that what bringing it back means. How bringing it back is expressed is as an action. And this brings us to how we will wish to perhaps you can say for the time being concludes this particular discussion. How can you allow yourself to apply. What you have felt and look for again. You are physical in a physical reality. The bottom line is the action. How will you apply. If something comes to mind share it. If not allow this to be rhetorical and explore. Thank you. I thank you. I. I. I. In Egypt. I had a experience. It seems like I went to sleep again. I was. In what? I. I. We were doing an exercise. He had a touch with chakras. And I stepped outside the tent. I went on the side of the tent facing the pyramid. Because what was going on in the tent was not for me. Something else came up. Then you followed no theme. I saw an extra director on it. I looked into his third eye. And I went into a. What a tactic. It was like a. A. A. Wind tunnel. And a. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. He said he would take into Paran accidental. He shot in three and a half days. Bad 33 at the sidewalk in Pe Speaking. The varita was pretty stupid. My other�. Yeah True. you felt back at school? It seems like I was in the police. I didn't know what happened. How do you woken up to? Yes. Oh. How do you interact with what was offered to you as a perspective from your wife? Do you choose to match it in by interest? Or do you choose to say thank you but no thank you? Thank you but no thank you. Do you understand that that has been a service to you? Did you thank her? Ah, perhaps not. And validated her first. Ah. Are you doing that now? No. Do you understand the value and that the expression of the validating of her right and reasons you have a viewpoint is to thank her for the offer. Yes, I understand. Do you understand that you need not embody what she has said but still have her particular story being just as passionate without being patronized? Yes. Oh. New proofing. I got a sense that the conversation I was having and I thought that it was with extra stress too, was something to do with what's been topic tonight about an unconditional love. That is shall we say a universal faith. Yeah. Do you ever sense who I was talking to? Is it really that much too? It seems like there's a show about more and more. Was it a familiar interaction? Concentrate rather than on the position of your body and how it felt. The feeling was it a familiar? See this? Hey? I have my hands up towards the pyramid. Now now, one moment. Was it a familiar feeling? Was it a familiar position? One moment? Was it a familiar emotion? It felt while you were there, did it feel familiar? I am getting to something if you look at this place and that's what I'm saying. Yes. What did it seem like? Oh. Have you ever interacted with any other extraterrestrial source and arrived a similar feeling? Not actually. Yes, I did. I'm very excited. Oh. What was the source? The shark. Thank you. Is that really so the seal? Is that right? Well, I can share with you. Oh, please do. We always in that sense revel in statements. We understand to us questions are simply statements that you are looking for validation of external. So if you are willing to straighten out the question mark and make it into an information point, you are being more responsible for your expression. You proceed. The message that Beshar gave me there was about unconditional love. And then later on I shared that with the panel. I think that you were on. I think. And about, I guess it was so. And I think that you were talking about the, whatever we put out we get back, how we've been putting out a lot of negative stuff into the universe and we've been getting it back. And now it's small with three questions. Yes. And now that we're putting out, we're starting to put out a hundred additional love, we'll be getting that back. Absolutely. And this changes the entire quote unquote prediction. So the spaceships up there don't have to hang around in law. Well the idea is they are only there to observe, revel, share. And in that sense participate tangentially. You do not need to be bathed. You are not drowning. And the degree of your creatorhood is expressed through your willingness to experience the degree of separation and limitation that actually makes you each seen as a lone, discreet individual. This is viewed from, shall we say, collectively speaking, us as great power and courage, not in that sense helplessness. There is no one waiting to save you. What it refers to as an uplifting is your willingness to unfold into your totality, thereby raising your vibration, uplifting yourself to a degree where we can interact physically, face to face. Not from a sense of need, not from a sense of dependence on pushing, but from a sense of sharing as you are doing now by making a statement as equal, or we see the equality of all creation. No exception, not even you. There was an interesting thing happen, the first sight that was there in Egypt. Oh, it seems like I had a visitor that first evening, the bright light coming through the curtain. Before you proceed, when you were within the structure you called great tyranny, did you also feel something similar? Yes, I did. That was, perhaps you can say, individual guide, and I am using the term quite loosely and say, assigned to each and every one of you for what you would call the duration. Now again, this is quite loose in the arbitrary translation, but for the duration of that particular experiential excursion. Many of you have found to be particular communications individual to that particular timeframe in Arabic. This also occurred to the Chinese. This also occurred consciously to others, and unconsciously which will burst forth in others as well. So you may understand that to have been a direct connection to what you would call ancient Egypt. And perhaps you can say even further back than that. Or just back than ancient Egypt. Like, you share it to the library on that. No. That doesn't mean we never will, but when you begin to explore to the degree of the line that we have laid out, that allows us that action. So, there's probably back into ancient Egypt. As well. Okay. Further than that, too? I think so. There's three journeys. They all want. Yes. Okay. Is this possible to find out who the spirit guy was? I buy acting. Mm-hmm. But not acting. Other than the nature of God is that they are accessed invert, not external. Therefore, your greatest degree of clarity and connection lies within. When you are turning outward and asking such a question, you are invalidating so to speak the directness of your connection. And you are, shall we say, rather than using the telephone, attempting to yell across the greatest? Okay. I understand. Thank you. I will be in contact with you. Amen. Amen. Amen. Allow me now to pause for a short break which we do request. We'll last 10 to 15 of your minutes of counting. And then we will resume contact at that time. There are others who wish to share and we would not want to miss it.
