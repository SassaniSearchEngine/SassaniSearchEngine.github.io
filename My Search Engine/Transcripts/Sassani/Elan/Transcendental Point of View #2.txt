 Oh, I don't say, before we continue, allow me to say a few more things. We discussed the idea of point of view and understand that each point of view is another sensorial input, if you will, to all that is, again, you are the eyes of creation. You are also the ears, the nose, the hands, the nose. But understand that the concept of multiple points of view allow all that is to access many different angles, many different aspects of creation. If you wish to use the analogy, the channel just has, by establishing more than one point of view, you can get around an issue, literally. You, in general, will proceed from your point of view and perceive through your point of view only the things which are consistent with your point of view. This may vary quite greatly from the point of view of other individuals. However, what is being viewed, so to speak, is the same one thing. And one of the things that allows the differentiation of points of view, perhaps you can say, is the rate of your consciousness, the rate of your perception. Allow us, before we proceed, to use an analogy that we have used before. You have what you call a spinning propeller. Can you picture that? Feel free to say yes at any time. Oh, thank you. Now you have what you call a strobe light. Are you to synchronize that strobe light to the propeller so that for each one revolution of the propeller, the light goes on once, what you will perceive is the propeller seeming to stand perfectly still, is that clear? Now understand, the point at which you begin your strobe determines the position that you will initially see the propeller in. It also determines the only position that you will see the propeller in. Now were you able to synchronize your strobe in this way and without interfering with your strobe, proceed in that sense, the strobe of another, perhaps slightly out of sync with your own so that perhaps the propeller was in a slightly different position when the strobe was initiated, that other point of view will see what appears to be a different propeller or perhaps you can say a propeller in a different position. Is that also clear? Therefore understand that one event, one propeller, but according to the timing and the rate of the strobe determines how you perceive that one event and the differentiation in rate and timing of perhaps you can say the strobe of your consciousness is what allows there to be many different interpretations, many different presentations of that one thing. So therefore your own life is, but again a point of view that you perceive according to the rate and timing of your consciousness itself. Therefore simply in sharing this with you are we wishing to express that point of view is what enables you to perceive diversity, enables you to perceive in fact the same one thing as many different aspects, many different realities, many different presentations. So therefore you are truly multi-dimensional creators and in one sense at least you can say that you have synchronized your strobes at least in the aspect of agreeing to co-create a similar seeming quote unquote same reality. In order for us to interact with you we make perhaps you can say particular adjustment in our rate and timing of consciousness, but we find we do contain the ability to make these synchronization and therefore do to this ability on our part. We again thank you for your receptivity and again ask how may we be of service to you. Sharon, hey. I have a question by proxy for Verona from Australia. Alright. And apparently there is much to do in Australia about a certain date, July 26th. And she would like to have you extrapolate on any significance that you know of that. One moment. Very interesting. Thank you. Understand that your society creates many landmarks, many gateways that you walk through. We have again shared that from your October 15th, your 1992 year to approximately your March 15th, your 1993 year. A conducive gateway of opportunity whereby you will find positive momentum behind the choices that you make will present itself. In this particular instance that date to us upon scanning it represents interestingly enough a threshold. Perhaps you can say in one way and one particular perspective, you can say that it is in a sense the threshold which will allow mankind in a sense to begin to perceive more blatantly dream time. And when we utilize the terminology dream time, we mean whereby you begin to feel more and more synchronistically to an earlier conversation does this relate that this dream contains many of the malleable aspects of your nighttime dream. This is also the time so to speak that we will or the ground, the playground, the meeting ground that we will if it is to be physically meet face to face. The threshold we are speaking of is that that particular date would seem to indicate the timing of the arrival of enough individuals in your society to begin to look at the issues surrounding taking back their power and creating their world and life according to preference that enough individuals by that particular so to speak cut off date is not etched in stone. Still again be exploring these issues to make enough of a profound effect on the entire unconsciousness of your mass conscious to allow individuals one at a time who now begin from that point forward to choose to look at taking back their power to be that much easier to do that momentum creates in a sense you can say coattails that other individuals may in a sense ride upon. Again that is only an analogy for it will not be a passive ride by any means. Therefore from our particular perspective that would be the significance of that time frame and we thank you for allowing that awareness at this time. Is there something else? Yes for growing against the extent we face and through channeling with an individual from your society she refers to as Dharma. We understand and allow us to simply say the following. In no way and at no time did we ever suggest that the communications from that particular individual would be in the form of verbal, audio, perceptible voices. So therefore in a sense waiting to hear the voice physically will not serve her purpose to continue and expand the interaction. Simply we suggest to her to trust what she perhaps perceives to be voices in her mind rather than physical voices. Now sometimes we will suggest listening as though listening to a very quiet sound with the expectation of hearing it to set up your attention in a particularly fine focus. But we do not literally then mean that you will generally then hear a physical voice. Now it is not that this is impossible. It is just not our particular style and that is who she is dealing with. So therefore there need not be a rigid expectation that it come in a voice and to whatever degree she will apply and use what is coming in the form and it is already coming that is what will expand the interaction. Therefore. Is there anything else? I think that will serve for her quite well that it is an issue. For myself I would like to say in regards to the show. Regards in that sense. Arthur, have we thank you? For the channel perhaps you can tell him for us that there was a particular dream that he had whereby he perceived that he had agreed. To provide an interaction of this type. But in the dream he perceived that he personally needed to be responsible for the content and therefore created anxiety, created fear, created lots of relatives and interesting amounts of people coming to that particular interaction that he perceived he had no idea what he would say. Allow us to simply share the symbology of that and that is that when individuals are channeling they need not take responsibility in any way for how another person takes the information. Period that is the only message from that. All the channel can simply do is to communicate the concept in a clear and fluid way that are coming through. From our perspective the concepts that we render are exactly the concepts from our point of view that will be of most service to an individual. But once they are shall we say put out it is then up to any individual to do what they will so you cannot truly be responsible for how someone decides to take and use or not take and not use the information. This was a sin logical representation of that particular exploration. And we thank you again. Back there. May I? I am experiencing flux in my business, personal, family and domestic life. Well how exciting. It is exciting. It is given me an opportunity to define who I am in these matters in the materials of my life. It also caused me to bring the question to bring up questions like what am I up to, why am I here. Well all those questions lead you directly back to your excitement. For that the answer to these questions. And what you are exploring among other things is are you truly doing what you are doing because it excites you or because you don't think you have another choice. Fine. And that's the comment you have on this process. Well that particular aspect of it you proceed. I was going to ask for any comments that you have this process that is going through the last couple of years. It is simply again allowing yourself or perhaps in certain terms forcing yourself to evaluate your situation and allow you to run through your situation in terms of what excites you, what is representative of who you are, what moves you and what does not. And then look at why you would continue to do the things that do not excite you. Two more things. In a sense you can say separating your wheat from your chest. Well what is concerned that came up in that regard is I started doing something to a project in order to enable me to do another project. And I can get so wrapped up in the initial project that it begins to expand out of proportion to its original concept and its original purpose. Well does this then not lead you to more exciting possibilities? Well it certainly could. That's one of the things I am looking at. Let me ask this specific question. I was in the cardio today on Route 2 Transactant Business and I felt, I really like that I was really low energy and I felt yucky. On a thing, yourself. Well yes I suppose. What I experienced was that I was surrounded by entities that were growing upon me, were draining me like low light yucky entities. In a sense you can say that this is symbolically the removal of responsibility. You need not take it literally. Okay well what I did under the circumstances. You were commiserating with portions of yourself. I shoot them away. I shoot them away. But again, too well. Why not in that sense realize that they are your children. They are your creations as well. And rather than shooting them, embrace them and dialogue from your transcendental point of view at how they serve you. What their function is, allow them to deliver their message and then you will notice they will be on their own way with no shooting. Interesting, pursuing an excitement which is a reflection of me pursuing my excitement. Another thing, when you brought up at the last interaction the time machine as you put it. Was wondering how long this question would take. Right. Upon hearing time machine, I flashed that Lord and I were for the time machine revealing ourselves to ourselves in present moments. Could not have said it better. Thank you for saving me the answer. But understand it or perhaps you can say and understand it. Sometimes we have discussed but with you before. I'm a but man by the way. As we know. It would be mechanically imprecise to say that it was from your direct linear future. It is a parallel reality future. So it is a part of yourself but it is not linearly directly related to you. But it is an aspect of a probable future self that in a sense touched back and allowed you to see coming into action some of the possibilities. And are you to in this linear dimension go forward quote unquote into a future and then travel in such a time machine you will be skewing across to another parallel reality. We understand this does not translate well. Do you. What is the significance of that occurrence? I can say again. Communication from your future self that say you are doing just fine. Look at what's just ahead. I get it. Let me ask this. Is it possible for us to take a journey for that craft in your imagination or your dream reality or if you in that sense allow it to be astral safe at this point. But physically it is a possibility in your quote unquote future. That is what it was telling. So remain grounded at what you can do right now. And if that is attracted to you simply maintain it as an expectance. What specifically if a craft in a parallel future shows up is it possible for me to go aboard that craft. It is possible. In general that will go against the grain of the agreement of such travel. Hey there is in a sense a non interference approach from it. But it is possible. They are stretching the rules of their get to show themselves. It will always be your opportunity to believe that you saw it or not. If you are physically taken aboard a craft perhaps it will not leave you that opportunity any longer. Did you comment on the unusual configurations of the craft in the equipment. Simply that that particular arrangement that particular array that particular sensor arrangement is conducive for time travel that particular shape rectangle. And this craft very definitely does not move through space and time space and time moves around the other side. Thanks. Now also since you brought up these distinguishing characteristics our particular craft are triangular versus your general usual saucer because triangular is the most conducive shape that we have found for interdimensional penetration. What's the property? Untranslated because of the non existence of technology on your end to use as an analogy. What does it have to do with lines of force? In the precise way that you may know. Now does this craft move through time and space? I am talking about the time you can. So this kind of space move around it according to the same principles and for technology then work around moves into dimensionally in time space. There are similarities but there are many differences and there are shall we say two sets of propulsion to that craft and one does enable it to physically move within a reality at what you would call sublight. And when they actually move through time and space or to a different time and different space do they do so by altering the locational and time coordinates of the craft itself? In that sense it is similar to our own craft and that they isolate themselves and reinsert if you will themselves vibrations. It is done by consciousness interface. Is it done by sometimes you can't be integrated in magnetic field? Well interestingly enough from our perspective consciousness interface from your perspective or from the humans using it mechanically. But we do not make the removal if the consciousness pushes the button from our perspective the consciousness in that sense is responsible. So there you are relying upon a computer to. In a sense you can call it that. It is perhaps you can say more self aware which the understanding of many of your scientists now is that that would be impossible for a computer. So perhaps it would be renamed. At the recent point where they can interface their consciousness with their computers. Not as we do to some more of a surface oriented degree. There is the beginnings of that in that particular stream. And is this craft more of a mechanical construction as opposed to yours being grown out and living crystal? Hey. Thank you very much. Absolutely. Sure. Over that event. Hi, left. Everything. I wanted to mention that Andrew the t-shirt if you can get a mental image on it is illustrates what the transcendental point of view I to hand. And literally tells you that you draw yourself into your layout. I really like that. Put that on for this. I don't know. I wanted to tell you. Thank you for the added energy for getting my car and that it's talking to tell me about the consciousness of the computer. It just made me laugh because my car has consciousness and I'm very excited to be with myself. Thank you. Or it was the action based on whatever information you perceived you had that created the reality and nothing that we did. I did. I did. I did. And you went left. And well, I just wanted to talk about a little bit about another sort of dream that I had which was. Oh, that sort. How dream. Sort of. And I'm. And I'm. It's a person. I'm meeting. I am meeting in parallel. Future. And he. Is very. Close to me and we have a lot to do together in this lifetime. And I want to know if you're in contact with him at this moment. No. But you. I know. I was under the impression that I would meet him through my excitement in my journey of life. But not necessarily directly through them but from the excitement of the journey. Oh, my. Oh, my. Oh, my. Hey. And. Over the past year and a half. I've been trying. I've been applying the concept of following my excitement. By the way, you have been applying it also. And I feel like I have been. And I've been using it to find what my next job should be. And it's led me through a number of different ideas about what my job should be where I've gone from one career goal to the next. And it's given me some time to grow spiritually so I kind of feel definitely a conversation. But now financial pressures are bringing me to the point where I have to start working soon. And coincidentally, although I don't think it's a coincidence, my clarity on what I should be doing is also becoming much clearer. And I feel like I'm beginning to attract to the people that I feel good about, which is important to me because I want to work with people that I like and like being with. And it seems like things are starting to come together. As well they are. But may I ask you, what is this exciting thing? What is the vision of which you are now clarifying? Well, I have a business background and I thought I wanted to work with children and nonprofit management. But I kind of bled back into using my business skills to do consulting to utilities to help them cut back, help their customers cut back on energy consumption. So they don't have to build new plans and I back up and raise the reason. What do you think? Get shaky. You need not create the point at which you then force yourself to look at particular things by dropping out the bottom of your abundance. And your willingness to move now will allow you to never create that point. Well, a lot of times I feel like I'm not doing enough. Why? Well, because I guess it's, and I'm not sure if it's an old critical belief system that I have that I'm never doing enough is telling me this or if it's my excitement telling me to do more. Oh, well again, when you say the belief, I am not doing enough. Again, it feels a particular way. Can you conjure that up for me now? Well, explain to me how that feels. Well, yes, I wanted to, for example, last week I really wanted to have my resume. Oh, one moment without providing a hypothetical incentive. Right now, state to yourself in your imagination with your eyes closed if you've heard. The belief that you can never do enough. In this moment, isolate everything else out. How does that feel? It feels really just empowering and uncomfortable but unfortunately familiar. Oh, it's all right. Did not say judge it. Now, can you see feeling this way that you will assume a particular attitude? That attitude is the emotions you are feeling are negative will in general be a negative attitude. Yes. And therefore, no matter what actions you perform with that as an underlying premise cannot help but subtly affect those actions. Correct? Yeah. Now, blank your mind. Is it blank? I'm going to get it down. Oh, state the belief to yourself that no matter what I do, it is always enough. And tell me how that feels. It feels expansive and light and much better. One of the nature of the thoughts you now have. More creative, but I have more freedom to try different approaches to the sound search. Oh, hold that. Now, the first unpreferred belief, I can never do enough. Regenerate the emotion that goes with that. Do you feel that? Yeah. Okay? Yeah. Now, in your imagination, perhaps restating that you can never do enough and feeling that, how do you see yourself acting? What do you do when you believe, feel, and think this way? Describe the you in your imagination, maintaining that feeling. With that feeling, I, in my actions, kind of apologize for my existence. I feel like I'm imposing on people because they're not being good enough. Oh, do you paradoxically find that even though you are not doing enough, you even still have a hesitation to do more? I do. I feel like I should do more, but I don't. Again, put that aside and back to the preferred belief. No matter what you do, it is always enough. It is the right amount. How does that feel? Great. Now, what do you see the you in your imagination doing? Reacting or communicating with people in a more equal and free-abiding? Do you see the difference? Yeah. Do you feel the difference? Yeah. Oh, both are true. You get the difference. And that is all there is to you. You have not left your seat. You have not been involved in situations yet. You have just created emotions that correspond to each belief effortlessly. And this is how effortlessly always can be. If you are willing to create that new belief without invalidating the old one. Now, may I ask you another question? Can you maintaining the you you prefer to be? That you always do just enough. Appreciate the value of having felt the other way because it led you to this new realization. You now are the new preferred. And if you choose, you can continue to be that new. The moment you felt that, you were that you are that new. And since again you went nowhere, there was no outer influence. You simply decided to create that new. You can do that in any given moment. And when you do so, you are assessing from your transcendental point of view. And then choosing and performing the actions consistent with your preference because you say so. Then if you can tell me where this voice is, I try to hold that new preference of belief that anything that I do is okay. There is a voice of something coming up saying that this may just be a spiritual thing. And it's not really going to work. Well, you are feeling and your body is a reflection of your consciousness. So yes, what you are saying is one perspective. But again, from your transcendental point of view, you can discuss that it is not the only perspective. And using it to decide that you no longer prefer that uses that creation and allows it to transform. So let us proceed. Speak to that voice right now. The voice? Hey, what again did you perceive the voice to say? Repeat it. It said this may not work. Be careful. All right. How does that feel? Not good. All right. Blank. Now state the reciprocal state the opposite. Anything that I do is fine. And this is how my reality is right now because I say so. How does that feel? It feels great, but the fear is that the fear is that it won't actually manifest. Well, it won't if you don't act upon it. But it already has once you conjure up that emotion. You are that you. Now speak to that voice as that you. And when you act, when you move, when you do anything conjure up that you hand over the situation to the new preferred you see what it does and the performing of those actions, shall we say, can yield no other result, but having the reality reflect back to you that you are already that you. So it is up to you. And those voices are of assistance for they always allow you to see where do you stand? If you simply take them as options rather than the rules, then that's what they are. And then that's the only effect they can have on you. That is an option. Yes. Yes. It is true. This is just spiritual mumbo jumbo. That is one option. Another option is that I am this me. Now let's bring in and factor in your preference. And your worthiness to pick your preference, particularly in light of the fact that that preference is an unconditionally loving approach, a approach of service to other individuals. Therefore, what could possibly even in your old thinking be wrong without? Well, I feel much better with the new preference of me that we just described. But how do I deal with that voice coming from somewhere? By always giving yourself another choice. By not taking that voice as the way things are. Reminding yourself again, first of all, that it is one option. All right, here's the voice. An option. Very good. More options I have. The more well rounded I am. Now where's the preferential? Oh, here it is. Oh, I feel that. Now what does the preferential need voice say? Oh, it says this is me. This is how I prefer to be. This is how I will be most affected in my life. Well, look at these. They're absolutely equal. I choose this. This is how I would act. I act as one. But it seems there's a force to that voice that I can't suppress that easily. The point is that you are not providing the alternative and then performing the actions consistent with the alternative. Then you do. The first time that you do, the voice becomes more quiet because it is not relative to who you are now. It was relevant to who you were. But you cannot silence it by ignoring it. You can only so to speak silence it by acknowledging it, providing an alternative and choosing them. Equal choices. Do you at least conceptually understand it? Definitely. Do you at least understand that in any given moment you can sit down, take a setback, and perform any version that your imagination enhances of this particular perspective? Therefore, go forth. You have the tools. But again, it will always be the actions that you take. And when you do act according to the New Belief, you support the New Belief. You enrich it. You make it the most relative thing to you. When you listen to the unpreferred voice and perhaps act without giving yourself the alternative, you are supporting the old voice. You are strengthening the old voice and only because your actions are consistent with it. Again, the actions are where you can liberate yourself. And by stepping back from your transcendental point of view, you can then at least weigh out the alternative. And generate at least one preferred option. Because when you have two things that are absolutely equal and you simply prefer one, it does not take much to choose it. And once you do, and generate a specific set of actions and perform those actions, the results of those actions will change the whole picture. And also the volume of the voice. Okay. Understand. One of the things I wanted to do before I got into my next job was to try and transform my consciousness from a place of fear, which I had all my life. Fear being out and least focused on protecting myself or worrying about what other people are thinking of me. This is a place of accepting myself the way I am, trusting that I am completely safe and that no one can really hurt me. And I am able to do that more, yet there are still many times when I find that I will just all of a sudden step back and serve my consciousness and notice that I am focusing on someone else and what they are thinking of me. And I tend to say, why are you doing that? I do not want to do that anymore. So my question is, one, how can I do that last? And two, am I holding myself back in my job search by saying, because I am not having done that yet, I am not going to allow myself to find a job now. To some degree for question number two. Because I want to let go of that. I mean, I need to get it down so I want to get rid of any blocks like that. Well, again, to go back to question number one, use it all. And we do not mean acknowledge that you are fearing and again, simply let it go at that. Go the next step in that moment while you feel it. That is when it is relevant to you. And that is when, when you ask yourself, what must I believe to feel this, you will get an answer. Viewing it now, so to speak, in retrospect, you do not have the emotional momentum to truly glean. So therefore, in the moment, use it all. First of all, whatever the emotion and fear, feel it. Don't squash it, don't squelch it. Feel it. And while you are feeling, go similarly through the approach that we just read, in saying, well, what must I believe to feel this right now under the circumstances? I know that intellectually. Oh, tell you. By the way, when you know that intellectually, you are that. So from this point forward, use these creations. Use these emotions when they come around rather than saying, oh, no, it's the me I don't like again. Say, oh, thank you. Thank you for screaming at me. This is what if I look at and transform, I will liberate the portions of myself I feel in place. But I have the feeling that from the way you've talked before, that we can do this stuff that sounds from the way you talk instantaneously. And so I tend to put myself down by saying, well, why am I doing it? But that is not the new you. The new you would not speak like that. Remind yourself, you are the new you. Remind yourself that you do not have to change. You already have changed. And the timing of when things come up need not be looked at as the clearing away as so much the simple timing to integrate the timing to transform. Trust the timing. But also trust that you are the new you. And at least give yourself the phrase, all right, I hear that voice. What would the new me do now that I am the new me? The old me's voice is just shall we say poking in there? What is the new me's approach? I am this new me. What will I do that is reflective of why now am? Then you have changed completely in the moment. And what may appear to have the effect of processing is so automatic that you are already the new you. When they continue to come up, why can't we just do it once we don't do that way for the rest of our lives? Well, you can. The issues that are quote unquote coming up now are not the same issues. And if you are assigning them the same meaning and they keep quote unquote coming back. Obviously that is not the message. So be a little bit more open minded as to what any symbol is delivering to you. And if you say, well, I've learned this from that and that still keeps happening. Say, well, obviously that's not why I created or maybe that's one of the reasons I created. Now let's look at the others so that it can transform. One of the things that I've been doing is writing down my dreams and then interpreting them so that's my ability. And it seems that very often the dreams reflect attitudes that I hold during my waking dream reality such as fear that someone is going to hurt me. And I am assuming often that the value that that dream gives to my daytime consciousness is to eliminate that. But that you feel that within yourself is a portion of yourself that upon discovering could hurt you. And it cannot. Again, for the first time. That you can create a portion of yourself which will be of harm to you is what is allowing the evaluation of these issues. So just simply centering your consciousness in the concept that whatever you find out is of service may be irrelevant to who you choose to be and therefore will be on its way. Will be one of those voices ever quieting till it's simply so irrelevant to you you can't hear it. But you contain everything. So therefore some of those things may seem negative, some may seem positive. What you experience is what you focus on. And when you focus on one particular portion of your totality and create that vibration, for instance, positive, then the negative is still there but cannot find the surface of your consciousness for it is irrelevant to the choices you have made. Okay. Yes. But, Claire, why do I continue to have dreams where I seem to be threatened although I never planned. Well, first of all, we have just had this conversation. And I assume at least that you have not gone home, went to sleep had a dream and came back. So therefore do not assume that it will continue in that way. But again, even the assumption that anything that you contain can be used in a positive way can translate to an action in that dream of facing whatever you are running from. Of reconciling with whatever you are battling, then you are owning it and realizing whether or not you prefer it that it serves you in some way. So turn around and face that base. That will be the action consistent with the new belief and will transform it all together. Then you will find once you transform it, it does not come around again. You need to act on the message of it. Okay. That is just one nice question. What is our consciousness supposed to contain? I mean, this human exploration, it seems that we can't hold everything that all that is has. Now what you are simply describing is one of the filters that you create your consciousness through that you sometimes call mind or mentality. That is simply a physiological representation in a sense of the intersection of consciousness with physicality. So therefore from the perspective of your consciousness, yes, you can proceed and make sense of it all. From the perspective of this chosen focus, one of the definitions of this focus is to have much or most of it not be relevant so you can concentrate on a particular discovery or exploration. When you in that sense transcend, then you will be experiencing more of that totality. But if you simply take for granted that what you are experiencing is what will serve you the most within this framework, then again all that other stuff will simply be irrelevant. And what you need to know will be right there when you need to know. And just trust that my consciousness will bring forth the information that I need when I need it. Well it already does, so yes, perhaps trust in its already existing mechanism, yes. Okay. Thank you. And who you are. Shut up. Please, Mad. Oh, thank you. It's good to speak with you again, Alon. Alle. I have had a period of accelerated growth, like a lot of us are heavy. And I find that I'm very happy, injured, emotionally, spiritually, just really fine and enjoying it. You make it time, but my body is going to hell. You might ache all the time, and I'm just wondering, what must I believe? Well, let's get practical about it. What does this aching, as you have called it, force you to do that you would not have done without it? Not a thing. Oh. Because I want you, but it's just, I'm aware that my body doesn't feel good, and that I'm aware of all the aches and pains. It's not bad enough to really slow me down, but I don't want, I don't want the pain. Oh, a simple suggestion. When you are in your meditative state, simply envision a golden honey-like substance. Allow yourself to immerse your body within that substance. Allow that substance to seep into your physical body, till in that sense you are permeated with it. Allow it to work itself into your joints, the physical articulations in your body. Allow it to lubricate and fortify. This simple healing energy can be all that is necessary to the entire cessation of those aches and pains. That sounds really fine. Is there any else? Well, if you have fun with it, you will have more success yet. So I don't have to really worry about anything deeper than that. If there is nothing obvious that comes up, go on your way. Allow yourself to re-empower yourself utilizing your own natural ability to heal, and if in that process some issues do come up, which they may, then look at them. But if there is nothing obvious, do not fixate, simply move on with a positive perspective, with some positive action, and in the doing of the positive thing, then something may come up. But if not, it simply won't matter. Thank you. Shut it up. You're mine. Hey, Smail. You're mine. About six months ago, I had a conversation with you with my friends discussing light-trans channeling, which my friend and I went on to do with great success, and we covered a great deal of territory. Recently, within the past month, at a time concurrent with this channeling, my friend on occasion had zoned out as I described it. They will just suddenly go silent, and then suddenly they will bring in a different reality, a parallel reality, and start living that in this timeframe. It's not a problem or a disturbance, it's just something different. I wonder if you could speak on this phenomenon. Simply, it gives them an opportunity to touch many other aspects of your simultaneous existence, but it also gives you the opportunity to look at how this affects you and how does it. To expand my... The concept in my real concept of universe. Oh, and gives a reality to the theory that I already have that I exist in other planes. It gives it more reality because now I'm actually living it through watching another person do it in front of me, so to speak. Now realize the problem. You can only perceive something if you can paint. Perhaps it is now an option for you if it is time to, if it is attracted to you, to allow yourself to match that vibration, to create your version of what you perceive is being done. Then you will get similar results. And that in and of itself is the reason. I understand. In reference to the discussion we have had tonight on the transcendental point of view, I have been investigating what you are describing tonight as the transcendental point of view. In addition to that, I speak to myself and get anxious back and I feel that I'm taking a connection to my higher self. Well again, in a sense for connection implies you are disconnected and need to re-establish, you are simply realizing that you are your higher self. And in the moments that you do, completely identify with your higher self and can in a sense seemingly download large bits of information. Yes. Very interesting. And would you be interested in giving us an exercise which we can participate in which will take place tonight or over the next few nights as you have done in the past? Not this evening. Thank you. However, with you in particular we will interact in during state with such the fulfillment of that request. Thank you very much until that time. And to you over there. Hey. What's going on with my face? What's that? You are in that sense. Experimenting with other forms of balance. Do you understand the reference? No. Think about it. What is the nature of the mechanically difficult? I will show you. Well, one, it's not idling. Oh, one. It cuts out. Oh, now, by extension, how does it apply to you? Are you idling smoothly? Are you moving forward in a fluid fashion according to your excitement with integrity? Oops. One more. Do you understand that you will literally mirror or reflect in the stuff around you ideas within your consciousness and can in much the way that we do simply allow it to be most humble? Your willingness to take the actions in that direction will then have a reflection across the board that will even seem to extend to your machinery. Thank you. And to you over there. Getting back to dreams and dream reality, I have a question about things I've been experiencing over the past years. I'm not sure if it's casual crap. I'm sure I'm leaving my body. Occasionally, I'll end up in a physical reality, which looks like it doesn't run away. But often, I end up in a reality where I'm in my bedroom or in my apartment and there's other strange things there. Oh, how exciting. I like it a lot, but what I'm wondering is whether you could shed some light on where I'm at. Where I actually am because sometimes I perceive my experience as almost in a progression of, you know, at this level and this is the wind. Well, understand that it is a rather arbitrary question. For when you quote unquote, actually travel, you do not per se leave your body, for you are not in your body to begin with. You simply shift your point of view from what you perceive to be the point within the totality of your consciousness represented by your body to another point, which then compared to the body seems external. So you are simply in that sense accessing many other portions of experience that you create within your entire totality. Now, to apply this in perhaps you can say a constructive way, not that you have not. If you wish to go to a particular place in that state, all you simply need to do is conjure up how that place allows you to feel, rather than analytically mapping out the place itself. And that emotion will activate, will propel you in a sense in that state to that particular point of view from your point of view. This is as we have said, one of the instances in which you can visit our society directly and simply by allowing yourself to conjure up how interacting with us allows you to feel, will you find yourself, in shall we say, a very unusual place. Does that answer the question or was there something more specific you are seeking? I may have something else. The places where I am ending up, are they actually there or are they more of a projection? Some are what you would consider to be direct physical existence. Others are, shall we say, in the realm you would label astral, which is a quasi physical portion within your totality whereby there is a very loose relationship between the having of an idea and an instant manifestation. In a sense you can say a thought form are you in a sea of thought energy, but there is also literal in that sense translation. And you can say that are you to take us up on the offer to visit us, what you will be perceiving is A, not this, but A, physical reality, no less physical than yours, though it may feel a bit more dreamlike while you are there, because you will automatically do some degree compare it to this. And there will be time, but for a few more shares. Real quickly I'll be brief. My friend Lydia has a daughter, she's asked me to ask you what your eyes look like. Can you describe that for me briefly? They are almond, shaped, upturned, and you would perceive them as black. Okay, that's what I thought. This question from her is for your soul, if that's right, I want you to check on that. Perhaps you can say, but I, if you wish, you will take off. Okay, thank you. And who you, male. Good on. Hey. Last time I had a chance that this course of you concerning wealth and some of the belief systems I had around wealth. And we thank you for that particular timing allowed us to share something. That shall we say was your main too many. Yes, well it has allowed me a good deal of release and constructions and preferred beliefs. But I find myself one step further into it, and I have another belief. Oh, what? All right. This one relates to the belief that there just isn't really a knife. Resources, physical resources, trees, minerals, all the things that we. All right, but to use your terminology, before you proceed, there are. There are more than enough resources upon your plan. There is no overpopulation problem. What there is is a disproportionate distribution of goods, services and land. All right. Therefore, within that framework, understand that you can believe either. And one will lead to particular action that will perpetuate lack and limitation. The other will allow you to realize the abundance that is already there. Can you at least conceptually see that both are true? Yes, but the disproportionate allotment of resources is I consider gaining more wealth and acquiring more wealth. It was seemed that I would be gaining a disproportionate share of resources, which is the very thing which you. Well, this proportionate to what for it will be precisely proportional to who you define yourself to be. The universe is supplying you with the abundance necessary to continue to be who you are. This applies across the board. And if deserve ability is minute, then the reflective supplying of abundance from the universe to that individual may seem minute. But you're deciding to realize, acknowledge your abundance does not take from them. And you have that choice as well. So I'm not harming or in anybody else's way. Well, you will know in the doing of the things of your life, whether one particular instance is in or out of your integrity in that way. But if you simply proceed with your excitement within your integrity, how could it harm anyone else? I guess I look at like if I buy a real nice automobile and I think of all the people on our planet buying that kind of automobile, how much resources would take. But you have not chosen to be at least from your perspective, all these people. You cannot be responsible for any of their choices, responsible to them, yes, but only by being responsible for you and your choices. And should you desire that automobile, you deserve it? It is not that they are going and forcibly removing the automobile from someone else and taking it to you. All right. Are we getting it? And if not, please continue. Well, I feel like nudging. There's a nudging in me that says, yeah, but if everybody, I think everybody deserves to have this. But they need to exercise that deserved ability. They need to demonstrate their ability to respond to their own set of circumstances. And nothing you can do can make them do so. You could buy them the car. And if they are in the place of their exploration where they do not feel they deserve it, from one means or another, they will not have it very much. So you can only be responsible for your decision, for who you are. And what you are saying about how you feel about them is a valid perspective. You can say it is one truth and it will feed you all the rationales of that truth. But when you then establish the preferred view, you will get other truths, other relevance, other ways to look at it. So in that sense, if you will establish your preferred view in much the way that we have shared with the other individual and plug in an alternative each time that voice comes up, then you will allow yourself to dialogue with that voice and use even that. I have a dream that I just wanted to quickly touch base. I saw four whales, I was looking out to the sea, and I saw four whales jump completely out of the water and then flash back down. Is there a symbology to that that you can tell? There are many. But shall we say the most relevant one in this instance to you will be your beginning to recognize yourself as your hire for whales. Are the embodiment of the higher self of many dolphins. Sounds good. You are not one for one. At this timing, allow us now to once again thank each and every one of you for providing your own unique special point of view. Each time we interact with another eye of creation, with another point of view, it expands our ability, our point of view, for we are exploring expansion. In fact, so much expansion that we are beginning to just consider non-physicality altogether, not as an escape from physicality for physical life has been an ecstatic joy to our civilization. But as our point of view expands, there no longer shall we say is the physical embodiment, and therefore the next exploration is non-physical. We thank you for your continuing willingness to express who you are in no uncertain turn. And if you simply decide that there is something you wish to change and conjure up the you already containing that change, you will bring along with you and access from your transcendental point of view, a very useful tool. Therefore, we bid you a most fondant loving, pleasant, dream. Hey. All one. Three sasani beings are walking down the road. And two say to the third. But you are always being of service to other individuals. You always do things for other people. What's in it for you? That was the punchline. For in our society, we realize that the serving of others is the serving of the self. We thank you. Good evening.
