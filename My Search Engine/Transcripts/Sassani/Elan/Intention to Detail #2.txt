 She's well where you at? Oh yeah. Hey, because she's well where you at? Oh yeah. The show can ask you, how do you write Fremont's sense in New York, United States planet Earth, Milky Way, Dallas? Realize? I am not in Ramon's sense. How am I going to visit a watchful channel? I'll find you quite a time of the day. For sure. Yes. I'm not going to try to keep this light. Oh, I can keep that light. I prefer now, I'm at the point of transformation between a lot of negative synchronicity and positive synchronicity. Yes, you have any clear? I prefer to die portion of that. It's also over the point. Sometimes I find it uncomfortable and I'm still creating a lot of drama in my life. Oh, right. How does that allow you to feel? To press confused words. Okay, you know, I'm a mad viewer of nervousness. They do it. And I'm not saying they do it. Before I move on to that positive synchronicity, I just, I'm wondering, I feel I need to get a few tips about how to relate to Earth girls. You and your wisdom have any advice or reflections? Yes. I mean, I know a lot, but I'm trying to keep it light. And putting us with all individuals, the old society, our suggestion, again, you don't have to repeat the idea of, as you say, open up the idea of providing for any individual that you are interacting with, the idea of a clear reflection of who you are, or as we ask, or as we ask. Let you engage in an interaction with another individual. And if your approach to that interaction, as you say, you see that which you believe the open person does want to hear, instead of the idea of what you feel within the situation. By being honest, you will provide the highest degree, shall we say, of service to that individual, whereby when you do, again, stay where you think they want you here, you are a long then you have, an elaborate conversation with themselves. Therefore, our first and foremost suggestion would be to be honest to what who you are on based on your excitement and you are, as you say, sky foot, varalir. If somebody does not agree with your viewpoint, that is an opportunity for everybody involved in that type of interaction. In and from your perspective, an opportunity to decide whether other individuals does not agree with you, well, to ideally believe in it, or is what they are saying, making more sense to me. It allows you to identify your perspective and define who you are still for. The other individual has the opportunity to take what you say, in your heart, and agree with it which you serve them, or not, believe that it was served for an hour. If you are innocent, not living a life, doing that which it's time to you, and you are walking around, talking to the idea to others, you may find every step to be somewhat tense and by the fact that you are innocent in your terminology being hypocritical. By walking around, living with ideas, doing what I'm talking about to be honest, you give the best reflection, you any individual who is being, that's not your reality, it is possible to be lived, not just conceptualized, absolutely fitting. You become an already example of these ideas, and we suggest this protocol, as you hold, within any of your interactions, not only between, as you say, male and female, but the idea of between any individual that allows any relationship that you do have to be most fully served. Everybody involved is conscious way. We stay in the conscious way for anything that doesn't come and will serve everyone, but you seem to be a bit happier with the idea of consciously understanding that idea. That's a simple question. I prefer to walk myself. Very good. Then the sense you will be as we are, as bottle at alien, then we are mentioned. How that allows you to meet us. This is how we exist. This is how we interact. And what is most much think about our plan of the idea of what you call, and it is very cold to us, a lie. We do not lie. We never find any situation whereby it would span an individual's feeling or some such idea, and therefore justify protection in that, which is not true to you. We understand. I have done that a lot, but I'll be in conversation with somebody. I tend to take the easy way, I think, and tell them what they want to hear, because that's not true to me. The very reasons that you feel at all the centuries you are doing in the first place may not manifest in the way that you expect. Very often now, the fear that you have that holds back the honesty is unfounded, and in a sense you will be very surprised to find when you are the opposite response. So, for example, the political channel has, as you say, an entity to share the idea of being an actual, which is mine. From our perspective, this would have been around, but even in your situation, if you had your common realization by his wife, that sort of thing wasn't here to come. In the first place, the whole challenge was saying, all the action was not what he expected. There was much more on the odds, a little bit second. And even though, in a sense, this individual has not shown to do, as he says, hang around. She is going to be greatly by the fact that the channel is being not fed himself, he can be. And what excepting for level on this particular law has grown greatly. He would not expect that. Therefore, again, you can apply these ideas in your situation, whatever that situation is. And you do not have to continue to perpetuate and say what you think others are liking you. That does sort of the, but not in a way that allows them to have a first-figure reflection of who you are and the best. Look back, so you can be another individual. If two, three, five, two, them the best you that you are, a different perspective to them, that they can. If they choose, follow, if they don't have a better definition of who they are. I think I'll try the truth at the last resort. So as soon as you guys know Sistani, love M and you are. We are very excited about the idea. I want you to pass in and see what I'm doing. We are, and we share with you. There is not a chance shared with us. Although we use visual perception of the child in terms of putting the idea of your work, how, S I'll be saying, the perception of the message is in the form of energy. Does the energy work? The energy present within these particular magazines is very dynamic, very transformation, very valuable. And the individual will choose to derive different ideas from individuals with individuals of that artwork. Therefore it's not that there is one meaning, one significance. And even within the realm of your visual perception. Hey, extended viewing of these pieces. Does result in, shall we say, an error, changing perspective? Yes. You can see many things in these ideas. And it is roughly negative of what we have said. It's like changing your perspective can change the whole picture. Very nice. Thank you. Thank you. Are you good? Yes. If you have any other questions, please be afraid to ask. We enjoy interacting with your hands. As you are not as you say, usually, physically friends, after you've interacted with your actions. They are involved in you by your need, as you say, listening of hate. So in a sense you are right. Yes. Very good. We enjoy your energy. It's an active with you. Thank you, Artie. Thank you very much. Ciao. How are you, Fred? How are you? You into the eye of your awesome thunder, love. Close your arms. There you can be very deep breath, very slowly, very deep. Allow yourself to relax as you take, without any particular process. The idea of being no forces, no making, simply allow. When you feel as though you have reached, as you say, merited state, simply from a perceptive standpoint, a real light to us, the idea, only that which you remember, without invalidating what you do not remember, for you remember what you need to remember. You don't have to validate this idea. Reel-like the idea to this group of your dreams, of what you think of your time. Welcome, grandson. I think it's very important that I think that my body wants to burn my way through the heart and my way through the heart. The light is showing me to the window. Here's the place where I have the most important to burn my way through the heart. And the only way I can burn is to burn my way through the heart. And the only way I can burn is to burn my way through the heart. It's very sweet and it's a hand-stiff of the light that I can burn. It's always like a hand-stiff of the light that I can burn. It's always like a hand-stiff of the light that I can burn. It's really nice. And I can see your face here. Just dry. Just dry. I remember my beautiful light. The light is just heated to the light. It looks like the solar emotional. That is the emotional, the light. Our time would be this year so the polyester of the light arm isnexed...... avalanche time there. And remember our velocity continues to work... and the frustration is not really understood. It's me. It's me, it's me. It's me. It's all right. You have me created the same jobs perfectly. You have experience what we label. The idea of energy aligned. Somewhat similar nature to the idea of what her who asked me to do at the old time, the visualization of the physiological channel, the real old meditation. However, your particular manifestation of this idea shall we say involve more of the senses. Involve more the idea of a blending, a true balance in blending. Between both the idea of your self and civilizations in which you will come in contact with a human desire. And also the balancing and the blending of the idea of your believing dreamly out with your weighty dreamly out. Four, a, shall we say, simply of the idea of fourth destiny. Is that be delineating the line between the two shall disappear? And in effect there will be no difference between the idea of your dream state and your weighty state. One moment. Okay. Between the idea of your dream state and your weighty state, in effect, one has occurred the way you have been brought up to the real dream law and in it a part of your imagination, just a part of your imagination. However, one who said it is that they are justice real as this. It becomes a bit shall we say more obvious than this dream life upon tackling the multiple your physical death, but you do not have to wait till then to have this experience. You are blending these ideas in a very effective way you may from time to time begin now to experience the idea of being within a certain situation and wondering to yourself, did I dream or did it really not? I just let it play that is as you say a common symptom, a poor deathly common symptom for again that line up right now. What is your perception of the nature of the communication, extraterrestrial, and what it fights you in this real life? This is the implication of the question I have, but I can just present that the situation is just crucial for it wasn't what I said. It's true. It's true. It's true for one side of the world. It's the movement or the shape that was meant to be put through the law on the limit. You are helping the thinking of watching a channel to make some connections with this idea please, continue to define. I think I'm going to say that I have a problem. I said that they're suspicious of how they could react to the situation. How can I... Well, in a sense, in a sense, their job is to green up a bit. I have the only idea of your consciousness. But the whole is your desire, then shall we say the... And so many times when you're a bit sick, the whole difference between a patient and a student. You tell them, you said, well, you know, we're here. We are here. Do you have a sense of who this baby, understanding that a dasna man is calling me a lady? I really do not give a name. How not? My perception is, in a case, there is a conjunction with a communication. There was a female who answered it. And as I said, at the time, at the same time, it's quite beautiful because it's a famous book. Are you able to describe that female? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. All right. Can you give a... And you say, physical description. What is individual or example? Humanity form more like your own representation, more likely. They got spiritual representation. They are like, I think, real life-wise, but it's not about it. I think my purpose there was, you know, to make sure that you made sure that you were able to... Are there any other ideas about this which do occur to you? Now, we can just tell them maybe. Not just really, you know, like the time, you can just do what I do. Do not invalidate. But for just telling them or not having yourCloud team which helps With that hammering in, one line, there wasinc system and one line Uh Spiral really obscure uh With creating uh Vibrishing and things like other parts Um and the soccer. The Monroe goalie 28Chan disability would be 6FU at Kieroud University of New York City staff. The charges were 8F Livest Pr Testing them were reasonable for1994. It's very good that it's one of the representative ideas of some of these days, the author of that realization, the realization that, hey, such a famous compliment, I think you deserve it. Do you have any more to share? I feel like you're going to find the emotional body. Let it go, that will be one of the ideas. We shall discover you next day of your time, that of emotion and emotion. Thank you very much for your share. Much and very confidence whether or not you are aware of that idea. I think that there's a tradition that has the experience, the feeling, how much space do you have? In what way? It's a overcome, but it's like a high frequency vibration, I don't know. I think that it's really nice to be a prosecutor. It's very good, very good, very good. That enables us in this time to discover you this idea and like you. That energy is not in any way, shape or form. You cannot handle or you would not attract them. However, one of the ideas that you are now, or you may be able to build on something, is the idea of lack of trust. Therefore, our suggestion to you again, not to be as you say, redundant because it's always a part of time, is one, two, three. Breathe, relax, oh wow. When you feel that sensation and you have as you say, second one, doubt which you know is just negative trust, it can feel a bit uncomfortable. However, you may take the granted again. You would not attract anything which will be harmful to you and your labeling of this neutral energy eye, something which may allow me to lose consciousness and be invalidate for my friends, shall we say it's responsible for the discomfort. That is very invigorating. The idea is again similar to the other physical life in the channel. And he allows trust and he does allow our energy to shall we say flow without resistance. Then it becomes a much more comfortable idea. And in fact, as your degree of trust does raise what invigorates, why the idea of energizing. So again, read this not if you prefer and you will find you are what we call a threshold. It is indeed the evening of your time you wish you can allow your meditate space this energy with full attention of the group to progress to shall we say the next step. And you will be very, very surprised and very excited about the results we gather here. It is all matter of trust. It is all matter of desire. Do you desire this type of communication? You are qualified by definition. You are qualified by definition. We do not communicate with our qualified. You are qualified by definition. You are qualified by definition. We are self- with the same respect. All right. You will not be disappointed. But again, nothing will ever be forced upon you in this manner. We will never force you to have fun. It is our nature. We enjoy nothing fun. And we will fight you with what you knew that this is available to you. Therefore, out of the time. And again, because it always all comes back to certain potential things. Validation. Validation. Validation. You validate this and you will be validated by it. All right. Feel. Many good. Have a good time. We will speak again on this matter. I am sure. Cheers. Thank you. Sure. I have three interrelated questions. Number one. The first one. Can you tell me how many past lives I have had or at least on the planet Earth? Oh, many, many, many, many, it is my matter of another. Shall we say in what you consider your sound? That's any... Then nothing? Okay. In a recent life, did I order the death of 65 innocent people? Before we act around, we shall be by reflection on this idea. What has brought you to that realization? Oh, a psychic oriented sort of a person about a year ago and sent you me through the idea of kinesiology. Said that in my... That I'm now in my ninth life and that in my seventh life such a thing happened because I was working on misinformation. Now, when that information was in part with you, what was your first reaction? Yet, that seems very likely. That years from the end of the year, although I never do that. No, I was quite amazed with the idea of wondering about the impacts that it might have on my current life coming from such a four-war experience, and apparently three years, reportedly three years after this happened, I ended up killing myself with either a nine or a seven. But again, does this find great with you? Does this feel familiar? I would not say it feels familiar. That is a better kind of beautiful and pretty old question than any that we may have. You will feel familiar. You will feel excited. You will get pictures of our lives. Let me only say that in this situation apparently I was in some sort of a leadership position. I love, in this current life, the idea, the responsibility, and I've done this in my career, leadership and responsibility of an organization of people that I, in a sense, take care of and concern with, and try to help them grow, and could this be that I'm trying to offset what I did in that previous horrible situation? All right, but again, you know what? Oh, by the way, old recognition, old familiar idea, without an idea, would indicate that, although something along those lines may have a ghost, it may not have been exactly that idea. Again, one thing we are sharing with you again from time to time. You have everything you need to proceed in this one. Exploring the idea of pack-wise can give you certain information, but it's more the idea that you may experience from time to time, believe through from pack-wise, and at that moment they are out significantly. Karma or the idea that you're working something out now because of something you did that hinges on the pack being resulting in a present, however, it is self-imposed. If you realize it's a pack, the present is not a result of the pack. That is not how you say, find it, and the idea is if you do even use the play, karma, it does not have to be strictly as you have said, an eye for an eye. You can work out the idea if you give your ad, you burn it all in, all the life with your hat, which everybody plays in the app. You do not necessarily, and otherwise, to balance that energy out, need to be killed. You can balance that energy out in a positive way, for interest. You can be instrumental in talking another out of murdering someone. You can be all the distance to someone that has had someone close to their murder. There is many ways. When vibrating has haunted the alley, though, we can assure you of one thing. They will all be positive balances. Therefore, do not use the idea of karma as an excuse for your present world. You can't create it that way, but that removes responsibility from yourself. In effect, disenabling you from changing it, for as you said, you cannot change what you do on your own. If you feel the speaking of both the bonds, you buy some universal law. You are putting it outside of yourself. So, we get it out of balance, but it does not have to be an eye for an eye, a smooth person. And, again, if someone relates to you the idea of half-life, future life, ultimate life, present life, thousand-part life, you will have some sense of what that brings through with you. Do not invalidate your sense of doing so. It is very sensitive. You all have it. It works very well. What also works is that involves your ability to invalidate. Therefore, again, validate, validate, validate, validate, does not answer your question to the visual. Let me only add that as possible inertia, that indeed happens. On the one hand in this life, I have always felt and truly felt, like serving my fellow man, like I am a good person, but on the other hand, I have always had this little tinge of lack of, not sure I deserve some feeling of inferiority that I don't deserve, all the goodness that might otherwise come to me. I would be a slop over from that previous experience, I don't know. But, again, in your own perspective, have you had to do anything in particular to exist? No, I just think I've never very... Therefore, again, you consume infinite creation, believe you deserve to exist. We use this analogy, by the time you find it again, because it really gets to the crux of the matter. Treat yourself with the same respect. If all that is, thinks you deserve with this, then from that point on, it is your choice to take for yourself whether or not you deserve with this. Do you prefer to feel you do not deserve with this? Definitely not. Then it's as simple as telling yourself, I deserve to exist and acting like you do. Again, acting as this, then it shall be done. Thank you. Very correct. Now, one moment. One hour or two seconds. You are a wonderful entity, and you deserve all the joy and ecstasy. You can muster up. You deserve a never-ending stream of this ecstasy. Never-ending. Always to be happy. Always to have what you desire. Always to manifest that which you prefer. That is our perspective. You may choose the reason. We give you permission. I feel pretty much the same way. Thank you. Third question. First question. Third question. Third question. To what extent have I known any of the group in past lives? Very extensory. And let's specifically focus on Barbara to be specific, for example. Have I known her in past lives? Very, very specifically. You have all traveled the elements. Many kinds congregating in ideas of different groups, maybe four different purposes. Couple of lives stopped in between there, where by, where just sort of been a coincidence. However, there is a very high problem in this group on your planet. The idea is one of the first connections in life. Ah, Earthling was the one in. At that time, all of the many phases of the Blackboard civilization, initially upon your generation at that time, you are exploring many of the ideas that you are now beginning to remember and explore. It has, as you say, whole purpose. However, we perceive this side. You're not going to blow yourself up. Can I squeeze in another lady's question? We do, right? The idea that we don't have more to deal with than we can handle. Where and how and who decide that? You, you're by yourself. All by. Because the oversold idea, if that's what you're saying, like the oversold of the dolphin is the whale. It's the physical life manifestation of the oversold of the dolphin from me. Can our oversold be separate from our physiological body? Not real. All happy nonsense and maybe you are conscious, maybe you are not. Any misconception of yours is that your consciousness does regard within your body. Now, your body regard within your consciousness. And you have chosen in your style to make a separation between you and your eye of self. I am a heart separate from my eye of self. My eye of self has separated itself to be me now. You are your by yourself. And happy to do it by the simple recognition to happen to this idea that any hour. But my oversold exists in another person. Can and does both the idea of in your path, both the idea of in your future and maybe the only surprise in your grand contemporary life. There are individuals who are what we have labeled as cow's and par. All the last text of your own soul incarnated, but rather than confining the idea of your timeline, before or after, contemporary to your current life. When in a sense you reverse as you create that separation, all the thought perspective is somewhat of a waking up and remembering your one upon the physical life of your higher self, you will have the perception of the whole. We have used this analogy. The oversold innocent can be compared to the idea of your arms. Each counter of art can be compared to the idea of your fingers. From the perception of the fingers they are each separate. From the perception of the arm it is all one hand. You understand? Yes. I know this is a bit sketchy. I know that this doesn't exist. It's a conflict in a sense with your idea of this. But another hallucination which may be helpful to you is the idea of that. The way you look at what you call reincarnation is just that. I have reincarnated. I was reincarnated before. I will be before. Inharnated again. No. A more appropriate and a more precise definition of the mechanism which actually occurs is what we have called multiple times fingers incarnations, all happening at the same time. From the perspective of the oversold which has not failed the idea of linear time, it only does appear to you to be linear from within the framework of linear time. Do you understand? Yes, I understand. And to extrapolate because the oversold is not as you say, bowled by the idea of linear time, very well made easy. After this life you have the opportunity to incarnate what you would consider to be in your hands. In such a way where everything is still perfectly lined up to create what is now your presence. Very complex, in a way, also very simple, all the time you're paying it. Where does the consciousness fit into the picture? Is that part of the oversold? In a sense, however, it is more the ideal of judgement. And in that sense, somewhat connectedly out here of your ego structure, even low from the perspective of your ego structure, it is a separate portion of your consciousness. Or yes, when you live a life I fight you with any idea of integrity, integrity meaning integration, that which will integrate and not separate. Thank you very much. Bye-bye. Then you do not create your ideal so much of conscience. After you have this voice that tells you what you should not do, you are not thinking of who you are and there are no longer the idea of sure should not. That is the way it is. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Great. One moment in the mail. Can you interject this before the moment it's not? I have a dream, a lack of a better word. It is very interesting in that it's stored all out of the excitement. And it's else with the same subject that you are discussing now. Oh, what is going on? I was aware on multiple levels by my campus here. And that was quite interesting. From one perspective I was able to get into the consciousness of another being. And this being was committing murder. And without having any judgment whatsoever on the act, but just surely from the external kind of people getting into the energy of the excitement, without any judgment on the negative or positive, to feel the total exhilaration of your motion involved is feeling another person. And then being able to flip out of that consciousness into another consciousness into the victim's consciousness of being stalked and then feeling like what it felt like to be murdered and to understand that whole excitement. And to be able to go through the whole transition of eight dollars, like... Cool. The whole transition of what in the mind got through when you know, okay, you know, you can feel the bullet hit. You know what it feels like to keep disappearing, you know, hot feeling. But now I was keen as it's being able to read the biblical body and having all these considerations and then you're very good at being very busy. We have a right to act like some of this one. Go on. We're going to have sex saying, okay, now what things are so mean and very good things. I want to explore the idea of excitement from all perspectives. And I have any like certain different considerations on what we're supposed to do. And indeed you have. And all what you did experience did happen to you from both perspectives in our lives. Wow. What I got there. And it feels so wonderful to be able to make this more life-time, which is a split second, because it's the consciousness of what you've ever used. What we call it, a recapitulation. And what it enables you to do is view these ideas again from this new life, with it, new hours that you have. And also, it again supports what we have said. Without any consideration of crime, right? It's just wonderfully exciting that I couldn't answer this all. I have sex, final painters, and comes to a direct level of understanding without feeling any negativity. One of the ideas we just got to do.
