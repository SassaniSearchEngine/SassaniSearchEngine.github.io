 Before we continue, allow me to simply once again elucidate on the idea when assigning meaning to your wife to again remind you of your excitement. Before again, that excitement is the very sign, the very message that you sometimes ask for to make sense of your life. That sign is ever forthcoming. It is always present. Therefore, you no longer need ask for a sign. Simply perk up your ears, open your eyes. Not only will it be who you to assign the thing that excites you the most, but again, in every given moment from what is available, choosing from those options with that excitement and acting on your choice with integrity allows you to begin to effortlessly flow your life according to preference. And when you begin to act according to that excitement with integrity, the results that you get feel a new momentum. That momentum then allows you to see blatantly, obviously, how your life is exactly the way it should be and how you get in that sense to have the things you desire. It would be in that sense a pointless thing, an extraneous idea for you to have the ability to be excited about something and not have the ability to then do that thing. The excitement in and of itself tells you that you have the ability to act upon that excitement. That action again yields a result and that result then replaces the random result that you have derived in your life. So following your excitement and acting upon it with integrity aligns you to your purpose, allows you to fulfill the purpose of this life which is to be the best you can be. And again, I remind you that when you act upon this excitement with integrity that you realize that you have all the power you need to do anything you wish without harming yourself, without harming anyone else and the willingness to act upon this excitement with that integrity, with the intention of doing no harm, obviously then has a result that is beneficial to the society you have chosen to exist within. Beneficial to you and your life. When we had spoken earlier about unconditional self-love, your willingness to grant yourself unconditional self-love and act that way then expands your capability to unconditionally love others. You have a saying in your society, love others as you love yourself. This presupposes that you love yourself but it is also a statement of perhaps you can say the rule that you only have as much ability to love others as you first bequeep that love unto yourself. So therefore as you do exercise your unconditional self-love, your muckles shall we say to unconditionally love all else will also be strengthened and your ability to express that love will be enhanced tenfold for you in that sense in being willing to love yourself unconditionally get some practice at it. Therefore again by extension you may recognize that when you judge someone else because everything is an extension of you there is some idea that exists within you that you are judging and all judgment in that sense is truly also self-judgment. Again self-judgment is not displaying and acting from the perspective of unconditional self-love. So when you judge someone else or yourself use even that creation to ask yourself alright alright here I am judging. I like withhold myself love because I have done this no I still love myself alright now that I have gotten that out of the way what must I believe to be judging? What must I believe about the perspective that I am judging? Again I remind you that all truths are true the ones you don't prefer and the ones you do are equally valid. If you wish to have equal choice of both then leave them at the same weight in validating the thing you don't prefer places more attention upon it places more weight on it holds it in place and doesn't give you equal access it actually gives you more of a propensity to choose the thing you don't prefer. Remember your willingness to use your judgment to recognize that you are invalidating something can again allow you rather than exercising the judgment to simply exercise your discernment and discernment is simply this is representative of who I am this is not representative of who I choose to be period. The judgment comes in when you take the thing that isn't representative of the thing you choose to be and say well that stinks that gives the thing you say stinks more weight and keeps the thing you say stinks around. Therefore if behooves you to apply the same sense to all reality it truly need not stinks it can simply smell just as good but I prefer this one. Therefore allow me to thank you for engaging me with the liberal usage of your language in this instance and once again in expression of my appreciation for your willingness to co-create this interaction ask how may I be of service to you. I have one question. And in dealing with my area of self-bury I've been talking to some people one gentleman who works for a commercial radio station who has an interest in the whole transformational thing of the era. There's been a lot of about two the Friday before this Friday I just had a between Friday and six in the evening coming home I noticed very strange things happening in the sky. One of which was as I got to court self-bury brother there was a bright light lower than the stars and it wasn't moving I was there was door aircraft in the sky to a metron press about I said you had a ruler I say 12 inch rule there was another light that just appeared 12 inches away from it from my vision and it just stayed there then the other way all of a sudden decided we dropped down real quick and stop. I'm wondering it seems like there were other things going on north of where I was looking at these lights maybe one or two other particular objects that were not moving and staying in a certain area but very well can you explain what's happening I've heard also well first of all understand due proceeds. I was told by this person somebody had the experience nearby a few miles from where I live near an airport small country airport called the Oxford airport of a they called it a gray height being forcing a road it wasn't on the main path it was near the airport where its airport is one and it was that one night when in the last two three weeks that this is very a time period when all this is going on a Tuesday night another thing was happening Tuesday the time that I had my visual things going on and only 14 cars stopped on the highway and saw these objects that were doing really quite amazing things to them in terms of their visual perception. Should you explain what's happening that there is. Well first of all some of what you were identifying can be shall we say defined as planetary bodies on the horizon as your sunset you will see this at this point shall we say in your year understand however that there is increased activity shall we say partially in observing and reconnaissance upon your planet at this time from what you might call extraterrestrial sources there are certain shifts that are occurring certain shall we say tectonic shifts as well as certain shall we say shifts in weather patterns that are being observed by shall we say several of our respective civilization to some degree there was the witnessing of such craft in that particular instance on that day in terms of the particular being we have no information right now. When you say on that particular day you're talking about Tuesday night. Okay what about Friday of my way home and that one hour period. Obviously I was able to distinguish between stars planets and waves in that particular instance it is our perception that what you perceive as moving like was an aircraft and again do understand that depending upon your perspective and the direction that the craft is flying in changing altitudes and so forth that if it is coming shall we say head on for a period of time it can be perceived from the ground as standing still. Well let me give you more specific sense. It was towards the southwest I pulled on to the side of the highway and it was not moving at that point it was just sitting there it was not moving whatsoever it wasn't moving towards me you're away from me. But it is part of perception that it was moving toward you but since directly so it did not seem to change apparent positions in the sky then when changing altitudes there was a perceptible shall we say change in height until it was then again flown again colloquially straight toward you and then again seems to. Okay because if we aren't talking about the same thing the one I was looking at towards the southwest the two objects of light that I saw the low one was this and I say to drop down and stop when I pulled on the side of the road for about 20 minutes watching the light it was very bright and it was not moving whatsoever. And if it is coming at on for you it will be perceived as staying still. I didn't see anywhere it was just while I'm trying to say it was just sitting there wasn't moving it was just basically staying still. What I am in that sense telling you is that it is a shall we say misperception due to distance and in that sense direction of travel and in that sense on coming headlights. And what was the other light that was the ugly above it that was not moving away. Planetary body. Planetary body. Okay this is my question thank you. And we thank you as well. Sure. Align. Oh is it necessary in order to create a physical fact to understand the physics and the chemistry involved the subatomic physics and the chemistry. Not necessarily. Okay so then it is possible to create a physical effect by merely forming a clear concession of what it is that you choose to create. In a sense yes and have the shall we say clear conviction that such a thing is possible. Do I understand you create many things in your reality getting the results without knowing the specific steps to organic. Well I am asking myself how can we form an absolute crystal clear concept of something that one does not understand or even know all the component parts of. Simply by doing. Do you in that sense understand every little cellular adjustment in what you call procreation. No I don't. Are you still not able to do so. Yeah but the mechanism or the component parts that allow that to be done somebody else create. Well if you say so. But that analogy is simply that you need not be aware of all the details and can in that sense simply maintain your clear intention. But perhaps a whole other aspect about this is why do you wish to do so. What is it that you wish to create. And why is it that you wish to create it in that way rather than in the many way that your reality presented being that you chose to be in this reality with these particular parameters. Because it excites me to do so. Oh good reason. Therefore when you in that sense loosen up your definition of needing to be responsible for every little detail and again maintain the clear intention. Then you will find by placing the attention upon the intention rather than the details you will in that sense be doing so. Yesterday when I was walking back from lunch I had the distinct feeling that it was like I was almost going to come off the ground. Almost as though I could levitate it I was walking. The thought occurred to me that if I could hold that thought with no doubt then I think in fact I could come off the ground. Have a nice trip. So such a thing is possible. Absolutely. Thank you. Perhaps again you may wish for now within the belief that you have in place to participate along the path of least resistance. Perhaps if you can say that you have a mentalized scale of priority of what you believe to be most possible. It is our perception that it would be more likely for you to accept the form of shall we say flying that you generally refer to as astral travel rather than the physical upliftment of your physical body therefore address the lines of least resistance get your feet wet so to speak get your wings in a way that is more likely for you to accept under your given circumstance. That in a sense will build your conviction and in a sense can you flight lessons at the same time. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Why is man attracted to alcohol and drugs although he knows it is harmful and will destroy him. Many times for the exact reason that we had shared earlier because you are taught or choose to believe that you are not complete there is then the notion that you can be made complete by something external when individuals will feel that that is what makes them complete. They will have a vested interest in continuing to interact with that single. But when they in that sense begin to understand fundamentally that you created all that you create the effect and that the alcohol or drug is an external symbol that allows you to believe that you can create the effect you can begin to use it to recognize that the power is within you and when you are willing to unconditionally love yourself and thereby begin to feel that inner completeness many times those outer reflections are no longer relevant to who you choose to be or if when you already feel complete you then have a drink or take some drugs. The effect of it actually winds up feeling less desirable than how you normally feel. But again it is springing from the notion that you are not complete as you are and therefore in order to make yourself complete you will derive from the outer external environment things that will make you complete as you have perhaps noticed. Ultimately you cannot escape the fact that you feel incomplete and therefore only will that temporarily seem to serve that purpose. Again you will always draw your attention back to the shall we say cause of causes which is your inner feeling of completeness. So again allow yourself to be reminded that you deserve your 100% unconditional self-love. If of the things available to you you act on the thing that excites you. Most times the taking of the drug or the drinking of the alcohol is not truly the most exciting thing but is a resort that one will partake of when they don't believe they can actually do the thing that really excites you. So as you begin to allow yourself to see what does excite you what does move you and act and do that with integrity the choice of again drinking the drink or taking the drug becomes far less exciting. Does that make sense? Does that answer the question? Oh thank you. Oh I've studied astrology for a number of years and I was wondering if you could tell me in your knowledge what planetary effect the planet does we on earth know them are bestowed upon an individual according to his moment of birth. Our particular understanding is as follows and again colloquially a soul you choose to incarnate in order to shall we say explore certain ideas in order to experience certain things that you will find to be most beneficial for your overall sense of experience. In choosing the timing the individual soul will find the crystal slice of reality whereby everything is in place to enable them to fulfill everything that they have chosen to participate in and experience in this life in perfect timing with perfect shall we say enhancement in the form of the influences you are speaking on. So it is the perfect moment when you are born in a physical way where you shall we say physical eyes in order for everything to be most conducive to do everything you wish to do. Now this is not generally the approach of what it is in your society rather than looking at it as the opportunity that allows you to do all things perhaps you can say the desirable things about the arrangement individuals instead look at what they are prevented from doing. Now perhaps loosely speaking when there is a signal that certain things are in place that would prevent one from getting a particular result it can be interpreted as a feedback that can mean it is simply not the timing for that thing but by no means is it shall we say a system that prohibits you from doing the things that are representative of who you are simply it can be used as feedback but understand that individual who have no knowledge or interest or connection to this seem to defy those influences many times. Does that make sense? Oh thank you. How do you know how do you find what excites you what if you find what if you find that there nothing presently is doing it for you. Well first of all in general you do know what excites you and for perhaps in general societal reasons have either allowed yourself to be talked out of it or in that sense simply do not acknowledge it because everyone knows perhaps that is no way to make a living that is no way to make friends that is no way to shall we say be of service but that is the person who is saying that opinion therefore our first suggestion would be to remove all that chatter and simply decide what you want to do perhaps one methodology can be conjuring up in your imagination what you would call a magic lamp rubbing that magic lamp and understanding that you can now do anything you wish and seeing what the first thing that presents itself to you in your imagination is that would be mostly representative of your overall excitement however again we reiterate in any given moment there are only a certain number of choices available is that your observation that in a given moment there are choices that are particular to that moment yeah understand that from those choices always one or perhaps more but at least one will stand out as being more exciting than the others and this is the minute degree to which we are referring to living in the moment and from the moment creating according from what is available to your excitement now if the very rare instance comes along where you truly have buried within you what truly excites you overall which again is quite rare by following your moment to moment excitement you will then lead yourself back to that recognition but ultimately you can only always act from the moment anyway and the thing which excites you the most may simply not be acceptable in that moment that does not mean it is kept from you for your life it simply means that what is in front of you is more relevant and more conducive toward getting you to that overall thing which excites you the most but what gets you there most quickly is by establishing who you are in the moment through your excitement from what is in that moment and acting upon that though those exciting things may seem to have nothing to do with the overall exciting thing they have in common the excitement that excitement again is an expression of who you chose to be so though on the surface they seem unrelated the excitement tells you that they are all one expression thank you is that of this yes therefore to again bring it down to the ground level if in a given moment you for instance only have free choices I can eat read a book go for a walk what I am saying is choose even from those seemingly unexciting choices the one from the one that does excite you from those choices the most then when you do that keep your eyes open wide open with no expectation that it need play out in a particular way but with the expect and see that because it excited you there is something in it for you that perhaps many times will lead you directly in a very unexpected direction toward something else so bring it back to the moment you can always read round yourself to any given moment by factoring out what is not available in that moment well I wish I could pay this bill all right here I am in the moment can I pay this bill right now no all right that's not an option push it aside now this does not mean you will not pay the bill perhaps when one of the choices is to pay the bill that will be the most exciting option where you have made that commitment and you wish to fulfill it in your intention but by using that paying of the bill as an excuse to not move in a moment when the paying of the bill is not available removes you from the process removes you from the fluidity removes you from the flow and motion of your life so when you are in anxiety about something simply ask yourself the simple question can I do something about this right now if the answer is yes go right ahead if the answer is no push it aside you know you intend to do it you know you intend to maintain your integrity but do not allow it to obscure what is right in front of you and when you choose from what is in front of you re-grounding yourself to the moment by seeing what is in front of you when you choose from those options with your excitement you begin to step on stone that lead to the next stone that leads to situations which were not available before which bring you choices which were not available before which allow you to get the results of purposefully acting according to your preference because you say so is that absolutely yes pretty much so well thank you a lot sure you know then ma'am greeting and you have been following my excitement for the past few months and it has changed right now I'm very interested in channeling and I'm not quite sure how to start I was wondering if you had any insights simple suggestion first of all we remind you that you need not relegate the subject you call channeling to the closet of the mysterious for you are always channeling anyway you are a higher self in in a sense in order to express yourself in a physical form you are channeling an aspect of your higher self through into physicality so you are experts at understand that anything that you do with absolutely no doubt and no hesitation is channeling when you breathe you are channeling that when you walk you are channeling that when you drive you are channeling that for you are doing the action with a purposeful intention without any doubt without any analysis or hesitation so with that as a foundation you can simply apply that to channeling in whatever form you wish is there a specific form of channeling which appeals to you yeah it is the conscious channeling or therefore your willingness to drive into that and simply do that we will get the results however something that may also be of assistance is first of all breath is key your willingness to breathe deeply establishes a connection establishes an exchange not only with your atmospheric environment but also with the atmosphere round in about you the electromagnetic fluid of your planet itself your willingness to breathe deeply and fully will begin to establish a style of inner balance so therefore breathing relaxing and then allowing are the simple steps toward doing so allowing something to come forth allowing that something to be valid when something comes forth from that process if you wish to call it that you have two choices you can say oh joy something has come I have channeled this this information is useful I will act upon it and then your willingness to act on it midwife it into physical reality and allows you to see that this works however a second option frequently shall we say chosen by many of your society is after breathing relaxing and allowing the information to come through is the statement well that's just my imagination anyway that is not granting validity to the information that you do that that granting of validity enables the connection to be more firmly established perhaps you can colloquially say priming the pump and then allows you to expand the definition of what you will bring through but understand that information particularly at first will take the path of least resistance this means that it will take the path of what is easiest in terms of conveying and at first when you just begin to open this up within you this may seem to come in the form of information which is quite obvious if you say well that's just obvious I must have made it up you shut down the mechanism if you say well I contain many ideas the fact that these particular ideas have come up for me right now is what I have asked for it is taking from what already exists within me and showing me what matters right now in this moment and your willingness to validate that and again the ultimate validation is bringing it into action then perhaps you can say expands your ability expands your willingness and therefore then expands the givingness of whatever it is you are channeling is that helpful or is there something specific that you are seeking no that does help thank you if you are willing to start on that level you will find that you will get an instant reply however clarity is also quite important clarity in what it is you wish to channel clarity in what type of relationship you wish to have with what you are telling but also clarity in what it is you are asking if in that sense you have no questions there may be times when information will come through in it as a matter of fact fashion but if you are more willing to engage and accelerate the process by firmly establishing what are your questions what are your statements you then focus the energy focus the thought in a particular way that will allow it to address the specifics so the more specific you are and what it is you are seeking the more specific the information that comes will be this can also again be facilitated by enlisting the aid and assistance of other individuals who will perhaps ask questions that you do not know in advance for that will allow you to channel the answer and perhaps in seeing the appropriateness of the answer begin to reinforce your own confidence in doing so so that is another way in that sense to accelerate it by including another individual who asks again pointed and specific questions thank you we thank you you have done it all happy channel thank you shut it my name is what what's the significance of the temple of hot water to me what's the connection the connection from your particular point of view is in that sense assumed to be a connection to what you call the pliades that is our strongest sensing of your perception of the connection I perceived it was in that area the area the mastamia bit that I arrived from the pliades thousands of years ago thank you now you are beginning to act like an owner and the significance of going to Egypt at this time is it merely that the opportunity presented or is there a significance to making the trip at this time well there are many significance but one of them will strongly have to do with this being the threshold perhaps you can say of a new millennium checking in in a sense perhaps you can say with a cycle that you had began from the perspective of the lifetime where you are ending that time so you know when I arrived in that area I began a cycle and now I'm ending the cycle this lifetime will be representative of your strongest possibility to choose to transform that cycle and in a sense yes with then in that regard corresponds to a recapitulation of sorts again many doors will open and it's quite perceptive of you rather than simply shall we say seeking yourself in the idea of the pliades as it being the idea of your own earth inception let's see you may find shall we say certain relics or artifacts which may seem quite familiar to you for very literally you have created now later I've been gathering a growing group of non-physical entities that I've come to sense and be aware of not in the sense that I'm looking at the channel and listening to you at this time but in a growing sense a sense of being aware of their presence a sense of familiarity a sense of energy shift these beings have varied origins do they do we all share a common origin there is a common experience but what you are now sharing is their common reveling at your perhaps you can say bravado in choosing to participate in the transformation at this time because we seem to have a symbiotic relationship myself in these entities but they are for shall we say the most part in the background are you familiar with with Professor Glock from the central Sun not by that nomenclature can you describe yes he was a big red bird man that I saw as his child where did you receive in that sense the designation or name that just came to me a couple of weeks ago oh it is not our perception that it is literal but now that we understand it will be but the relationship between us became a parent as a result of a hypnotic regression I was taken back to that so taking back to that episode and a lot of place that I did not remember in my memory I went there with my cousins they got scared and ran I was curious the bird man started to turn I ran in the hypnotic regression we actually had a rather lengthy conversation where we capitulated mutual memories and I just was curious as to whether or not you had any awareness of him or he is one of the group that the non-physical group that has been forming this is something that is very new to me our particular understanding of the race you are speaking of is that they are tied to your planet are quite ancient in that sense so perhaps you can say you personally are connected they are shall we say only rarely perceived in this day and age by members of your society therefore the connection that you are speaking of is again quite ancient in a future interaction to some degree we will elucidate more shall we say completely about what you call the central son I think I'm feeling that in this trip to Egypt I'm going to open up a line of communication with with with colleagues both physical and non-physical so shall we say the highest degree it will be a physical interaction so that is perhaps you can say the main point now not that there will not be contributions and nuances from the non-physical but even though you may perceive that this experience will be quite spiritual it will in no way be so at the call of a grounded approach for where you are most useful and in fact the only place you are useful is from a grounded perspective that is when the ideas that you are exploring can then be brought into reality and be shared with others therefore as we have often said maintain your head in the clouds that is all well and good but keep your feet firmly on the ground and allow yourself to ground what you get use what you get interact with the physical places and the physical individuals and the physical events all the things that you are deriving as an inspiration this midwife these concepts midwife these spirits of these being so to speak into the usefulness of your life well that is consistent with my sense that going to Egypt at this time is going to facilitate by coming into a clear understanding of who I am in a grounded perspective yes what my origins are what the purpose of my presence on the planet is at this time and how best to proceed to be effective in fulfilling that purpose all right and if you wish in that sense to create an elaborate symbol to do so go right ahead but as we have always shared with you it can in any moment be as simple as you simply establishing your excitement and trusting that that is the very purpose you are seeking from our perspective you do not shall we say have an unawareness of your purpose you have many times looked at your purpose many times establish your excitement simply perhaps this will come into clearer focus at this point but much will be what you have already explored and discovered being perhaps you can say collated into a useful time will you and your colleagues be present in Egypt with us in the form you are seeing now and to some degree also physically now perhaps again not face to face but it is our perception that we will be in the neighborhood in terms of the positioning of our spacecraft welcome thank you and we for co-creating this opportunity you're lying hey just to follow up to my channeling question and I don't want to monopolize anything now one you are perfectly worthy and need not think of your contribution as a monotony okay unless you like that okay monopoly no I never did like that game oh my question has to do with Andrew mentioned before that he had a nine-year agreement with you and the shark well in a sense yes it is all perception though there is the option to renew it at that point that that will be shall we say the critical time period that will allow the channel to embody what we are saying and perhaps no longer need or shall we say choose to need to do this in this way so I was wondering if I had any agreements with anyone and if so who you do have an agreement however at this point in order to engage you in your own shall we say exploration I will simply refer you to your entity ask these questions even that sense you were looking for something to focus upon here is your starting point who are you what is our relationship what is our agreement allow that to be delivered to you and that will be your first opportunity to validate what you get your willingness to participate to that degree will then perhaps allow us to make further comments if that is necessary but at this point it is up to you okay great thank you oh we thank you you're lying nice you mentioned earlier first part of the session tonight about the next 11 months of 1993 that what to our mass media for a revelation of their knowledge of interaction with various societies like right hey and there was a strong degree of shall we say momentum behind October of your 1993 okay now again a prediction is simply the sensing of energy that is available with any given moment and because you have free will and have the ability to create your own reality according to preference this need not necessarily play out in that way but right now and perhaps you can say in the shall we say relative path as well that has been a consistent energy gateway do you perceive that number one because this year a lot of rumors are going around in a circles that October surprise is going to be 1992 that didn't happen July there's supposed to be something happening that didn't happen well one more perhaps what you expect did not happen certain things did happen what happened well in which instance well elaborate whatever instance you want to go into well in your July months as we have shared many times a particular gateway of opportunity has opened up which you are firmly with oh in October you may understand that your mass consciousness shall we say perhaps you can say make certain positive decisions which perhaps from one perspective may seem somewhat surprising in terms of the positive result and the positive outlook of the next few months of your time you perceive because of the new election of door and a flint and door that they will fasten the taste of disclosing all the files and everything that is involved in the whole process of allowing the public on the planet to know what has been going on our perception is that if it is not directly that they will assist in resulting in the atmosphere that will allow it to be so so yes so within the next eleven months of 1993 anywhere between that time a revelation can occur there will be shall we say perhaps you can say small leekings but again perhaps the largest shall we say fencing would be in the October of your next year and who will necessarily bring out the information the final point of the question is who will have the total control of disseminating this information where it will be the pepsi card CIA any of our intelligence agencies would have been in Washington itself who will be involved in this process right now the closest answer that we can give will that it will be a combination of many of the things that you have mentioned and your willingness as individuals to again contact your government in what you call a sincere fashion and impart to them that you are aware that this is going on that you are not tapping this version that you are not placing blame but that you are all grown up now and simply wish in that sense to be told what is happening so that you can make your own evaluation and decision this can accelerate this great thank you very much and to you shut it. It is my understanding that. It is my understanding through the transformation on the planet that there are those some human and some star seated extraterrestrial that will begin to transform into what I've heard is light body and I'm wondering if that had any relevance to a physical form that you might have and also how that would change up would it create a left-hand version. So first of all understand that being that you are all eternal being what you are saying in a sense overall is quite arbitrary because you are eternal you have no beginning you have no ending therefore perhaps you can say you are from nowhere but at the same time you are from everywhere so again from this finite perspective this seems a bit confusing overall you all have connections elsewhere in terms of there being individuals quote unquote seated down here perhaps you can say to some degree from time to time certain populations of individuals will reincarnate into a planet with the intention of participating in a transformation from what you are calling a more dense point of view to a more expanded point of view. So once they incarnate in that sense they choose by incarnating at all to play by the same rules which then again is to impose a type of amnesia so perhaps you can say many of the individuals who have chosen to do so have forgotten that they have chosen to do so in perhaps you can say getting into the role. Understand though you perceive yourself to be the discrete body that you appear to be within. You are again a higher self that has simultaneous existence on all levels that is again an infinite concept and would represent your infinite self therefore what you perceive to be your physical self is but one aspect of your higher self that exists on all levels of consciousness simultaneously when you choose to become physical and assume a focus that does not make that much analytical sense but the idea is no less valid because you do exist on all levels simultaneously you may understand you already exist on a level whereby you express yourself in the form of a life body. If you lie out on a timeline where you are now choosing to be perhaps it would be perceived by you as something you will become or that will occur or that you are becoming but it already in your higher self totality exists so simply you will experience becoming it from this point of view but when you expand once again into your totality it will all seem to exist at once. Your planet will perhaps still begin still choose to remain embodied in perhaps a similar fashion such as this for at least the next several hundred of your years. In our particular planet in our society we still have in that sense what you would call physical bodies which may be perceived by you in that sense to still be flesh and bone so to speak but they are literally more of a manifestation of light in that we are literally less than so perhaps you can say from our perspective it is truly both though you perceiving through the filters of your physical self would perceive perhaps only our physical aspect does this answer the question and if not please expand. Yes it does but I also have a question in it becoming in being both both some flesh and bone and life is it I guess I have a question about the feeling of it how does it feel. We literally no pun intended life less heavy in that sense this will also extend to attitude to consciousness we are quite light and again when you literally are really even from your perspective to lighten up you become enlightened and begin to express that life perhaps through the attitudes and actions of your life. Do you proceed if there is a request for more clarification? Well in the process of lightening on our level is there a matter of alignment with that which excites you that helps you create in that. That is an expression of your entire willingness to validate yourself as a result in action of unconditional self-love. The moment you are willing to express your unconditional self-love you will feel that lightening you will feel that light most notably perhaps because of your shall we say tendency as a society to focus in on it in your heart area but it would literally literally feel as though and this is one of the reasons you have coined this phrase a weight has been lifted from your shoulders. Oh thank yourself you are doing a whole of the lightning I am simply reflecting the brilliance of that line so thank you for allowing me to do that sir. C'mon. What moment is that? Yes. We thank you. I have a friend who wants to ask a question and she is too shy to speak on. The man you have asked me the mouthpiece of that friend. It is not that I am too shy I am just not quite sure what I want to ask. I have scoliosis congenital curvature of the spine and I have some decisions coming up to make some surgery. I suppose if I were going to ask a question it is not really so much about whether I should or should not do the surgery. What can I learn from having the scoliosis in the first place? Well most obviously and again I bring this back to you for whatever I can convey that you can then leave this interaction and still have will be of most assistance to you. So from this point up till now looking at it not from the perspective of how it has limited you, how it has been an inconvenience. What have you learned from it? Well it actually has not been very limiting. Ah very good. What else? That is there. I do not know I have had it since I was a kid. What in that sense is shall we say causing you to consider the option you call surgery? Oh. I have had more back pain on and off in the last year or two so I went to a doctor and realized that it has been getting worse. Oh it is not our shall we say entire perception that the cause of that pain is the curvature you are speaking of itself but perhaps shall we say isolated incidences within the spine itself. However understand the blatant symbol that you are provided with is that one person shall we say perception of alignment is not necessarily someone else's and if someone is telling you this is a misalignment but it is how you express yourself and it does not in that sense limit you then it is your form of alignment. Does that translate? Yeah although the doctor is telling me that if it is progressing that is what we are trying to work out now. Oh what type of doctor are you speaking of? I have got the pain excursion. It is our suggestion in that sense that you get a second opinion and our strong sensing that there are individuals present in this room at this time who made the other systems to. He is the third opinion but they will be traditional doctors. Oh again the traditional approach is that the arrangement of your spine is causing the pain. It is our perception that that is not entirely accurate. That is your style, your presentation. If you express alignment in your being and express alignment in your action in that sense you will then express alignment in your body no matter what form that takes. Whether or not someone else is perception of alignment or simply your own form of it. Is there something else? One last thing. We have taken experts a year ago and then we are going to take some more in a few weeks. What all of the doctors are telling me is that if it continues to get less aligned if my spine continues to curve more and more that I will have health problems in the future at an age when I would not want to be considering surgery. Even though it has not been a big aspect in my life so far and it may not be for another 20 years I do not really want to have a significant problem in older years when surgery is not any longer an option. What is your physical age? 37. Always. Again we suggest being very open minded and attracting to yourself all the other perspectives. Again not to invalidate the perspectives that you have gotten. They are obviously age-ruth. You can obviously ascribe to that truth and you can obviously create the results of the assignment of that need. However the more options you provide yourself the more you get to choose the outcome. Again you will attract individuals from this interaction. Thank you. Then what I am saying will be more obvious. Thank you. Shut it. Hey one moment. There will be but a few moments remaining to this interaction. Do proceed. I continue to be concerned with my brother's behavior. Oh what? Since his revelation on July 26th. Okay. It is my opinion that he does not receive. He is not honoring the answer. Yes. Does he flawlessly factor in acting upon that excitement with integrity? Would you say that one more? Though he is beginning to follow his excitement. be doing so with integrity. Perhaps the answer is not always, and perhaps you can in that sense remind him of the full definition. Acting upon your excitement period is not the information we share with your society, and in fact could be quite counter-productive. The aspect of the integration of the integrity is just as important as the excitement itself, and that in a sense remember takes into consideration agreements made. From a third density viewpoint, I think the delusions of grandeur apply to his behavior, and I honestly wonder whether he should or will end up getting psychiatric analysis and treatments. Is that concerned? That's who he is. Maybe he sees himself so much in fourth density that he has totally lost touch in his feet or nose, his feet or nose, nowhere near the ground. The reason that I brought up the integrity is that the following of the excitement with integrity is the grounding aspect of that excitement. So again, in looking at the specifics of his situation, apply that integration, apply that integrity, and where and when possible point out to him, again not in an insisting way, but simply as a matter of factly where the integrity is in and out. Okay, because in my view he is taking advantage of this fellow man at times. Oh, that is not integrity. And with the removal of that aspect also may remove what you would perceive to be the illusions of grandeur, which in general implies that one elevates himself above others. It is not integrity. I have been, I think, providing a pretty frequent, honest sounding board, trying not to be just mental if you will. Simply pointing out that this is an integrative act, this is a separate act without invalidating is not judgment. It is discernant. It is your contribution to his reality. However, again, we remind you to point out the integrity. It is not that we ever say do what excites you, period. It is do what excites you with integrity. And that is the key to grounding to the reality, to establishing balance, to being of service to the self, but not at the expense of being of service to others and vice versa. Not being of service to others at the expense of yourself. It is all one thing, all one event, all one consciousness, and can be nurtured from both eyes. Good advice. Thank you very much. Well, thank you. Not meant to be advised in clear perspective, which you can if you wish partake of, if not, so what? We thank you. Shut up. Hey, Lance. I know when this young gal was speaking, you were talking about different levels, and I know we have different levels of consciousness. Could you just expound a little bit more about that in general? Well, again, you perceive yourself many times as you begin to realize that you are literally a turtle, as having lived other lives, as when you die reincarnating to future lives. And from this perspective, it would seem that you are this discrete individual and will become other discrete individuals. From the perspective of your over soul or higher self, your over soul or higher self has the ability to perceive all these experiences as happening simultaneously. And this can be perceived as other expressions or levels of consciousness. Now, even if you use your timeline to, shall we say, note how one will choose to evolve. Your future self, so to speak, will at some point become non-physical, as you begin in that sense, to complete your exploration of physical reality. A future self, you can say, is non-physical. That non-physical, in a sense, is another different, not less, not better, but different level of experience. Again, from the perspective of the over soul, they are all simultaneous. And one of the things you are exploring in becoming human is the unfoldment, one at a time, of what formally was taken for granted to be simultaneous. Does this translate at all? Yes, it does. Is there also that it sounds like from my reading that sometimes we live different chapters of our lives and that, I don't know if we take them out of difference. In the linear time at different points. Well, in a sense, you become and express different aspects of yourself. You can call forth from these other levels, because even though you are perceiving that they did exist and no longer do, and will exist and you won't now, still from the perspective of your higher self, it does exist simultaneously. So if you simply conceptualize from this point of view that from that point of view, it all exists simultaneously and bring that back to this point of view, you can simply take for granted that it all exists, that all the lives you have lived are going on right now, that all the lives you will live are going on right now. Therefore, since they have the now moment as a common point, you have access to any of these other ideas. Therefore, if there is a you, perhaps you can say that you will become, that perhaps has a particular kind of strength that you admire, you can simply, shall we say, shorten the process by understanding that that you exist right now and calling forth that you from your totality and then embodying that you simply knowing that you are choosing to express it. We have that potential and it's lifetime to do that. Absolutely. Anytime you do. Anything else, that's fine unless you have something to add, I like this. Thank you. One moment. Anything that you need in any given moment, period exists within that moment. You can, if you wish, reflect back on your past, project to your future, colon, past lives, colon, future lives to enhance that moment. But you never need anything from even a moment ago, a moment to come, a past life of future life, you never need any of that to proceed in any given moment. Therefore, again, in any given moment, you always have what you need to have in that moment to proceed to be the person you chose to be. Realization of this allows you to bring yourself back again into the moment. The now moment is the only moment you ever experience. You speak of the past, you speak of the future, but you always do so from right now and never was there a moment in your life when it was not right now or when you could say it is not right now. Therefore, your power exists in the moment. Your connection to all other now moments, so to speak, exists in every given moment. Our moment is holographic and contains all of all reality. In your particular chosen focus, however, you may, again, express that in particular specific ways. So your willingness to ground yourself to what is right in front of you, in any given moment, is your willingness to express your power through that moment and use what is right there right now and you always ask. That perspective can be quite helpful in clearing away the cobwebs and, again, putting in front of you what is right there, assigning the meaning of your excitement to what is right in front of your face and choosing with your excitement, acting upon that excitement with integrity. All right? Yes, living in the now and using that to be the focus. And, again, assigning positive means. Yes, absolutely. A creator, in acknowledgement of their creations, may not always see exactly the reason at first that they created that particular manifestation. But a true creator never stops looking and never stops going around in effect to view it from the whole hand till the reason it was created becomes obvious. Clean positive meaning. In any neutral blank circumstance, then you will assign a positive meaning. And from that positive meaning then proceed with a positive foundation for your actions, therefore always yielding a positive result. Your willingness to do so, for, shall we say, a continued period of time, will create a momentum. And flowing with your life in a conscious way, with that belief that you are the creator of your reality, as all other beliefs has a particular emotion. You will know when you manifest this, for that emotion is ecstasy itself. Therefore, allow me to thank you all for your willingness to co-create this interaction with us this evening of your time. And I, in thanking you, in unconditionally loving you, wish you an ecstatic dream life and life dream, and bid you a most fondant love. Good evening. Thank you all for coming. Thank you. Thank you.
