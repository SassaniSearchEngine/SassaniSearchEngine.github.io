 I'll say, how are you all this evening of your time as you create time to exist? Are you all alive? Oh, thank you very much. Oh, thank you. Allow us to entitle this interaction. Choose all your creations. Understand, you create your own reality. Nice phrase. A bit popular now, your new age. But what does this really mean? Any individuals interpreted to me, I have some degree of say over my reality. In general, this is far more accurate of what most people believe you create your own reality, truly means. But from our perspective, it means more than that. It means you create it all. You are not even within a reality. Your reality is within your consciousness and therefore every creation, every creation in your life is a product of your own creatorhood. However, you very creatively within your society, divide your consciousness up into parts or segments. One or perhaps sometimes many of the segments or sometimes refer to as sub or unconscious. Therefore, when you create your own reality, you do so consciously, some degree of the time, but also because you have the convention of this idea. Also do so unconsciously, particularly when you are not aware that you even created. Or fairly enough, many times individuals will say, well, if I create my own reality, why would I create that? Referring to some particular thing within their reality that they do not prefer. And then use that as a proof that of course, I must not create my own reality. I would not be such a careless creator if I did. But understand again, because you have these subdivisions in the overall 100% consciousness that you are, some of these creations can be the product of what you have bought into on perhaps trust of other individuals, on perhaps trust of societal notions, and therefore not altogether consciously. How this can be used in a practical way is that you can truly make all your creations conscious and thereby transform the ones that you say you do not prefer. However, you cannot do so by denying any of your creations. Interestingly enough, many individuals are all the more willing with private, zest, and zeal to admit that the things that they prefer in their lives are their creations. But the ones they don't, not so easy. The ones they don't, perhaps they feel, slipped in there when they weren't looking. Allow us to address those creations, the creations that were in that sense, products of unconscious beliefs, but no less your creations, though those unconscious beliefs most often will yield reality, perhaps you do not prefer. But there is a way to transform this. And first of all, allow us to say that you can never get rid of anything that you create, for you are the entire universe and there is no outside. Therefore there is nowhere to put anything. Therefore, you can transform something, you can integrate it, you can change its space, but attempting to push it away or get rid of it is only denying your creations. And denial of your creations does not put you squarely back into the position to transform it. You can only transform any creation or any belief if you first acknowledge an all that you do believe it. So that is the difference between denial and transformation of your reality. Therefore allow us to now address the creations within your life that you say you do not prefer. All symbols, all events within your reality, again are part and parcel of you. You cannot truly separate yourself from them because again you are not within a reality, the reality is within you. So therefore you can truly look at any of the symbols within your reality as a neutral set of props that gives you the opportunity when interacting with that portion of your consciousness to determine how you wish to label it. What significance you assign to it is up to you. And here is the clincher as you say. The significance or meaning that you assign to any neutral symbol determines the effect that you get out. So therefore any non-preferential creation that very often may seem even to repeat and be repetitive have been ascribed a particular label by you that has resulted in the negative unpreferential experience. Now what this affords you is the ability to understand again because they are in a sense a neutral set of props. You can choose to label it any way you wish and be a neutral. What this means is there will always be 100% potential for a negative outcome or a positive outcome from the same circumstances. So therefore you can begin to use all your creations in a positive way. You can begin to utilize the creation you say you do not prefer by looking at them, by reassigning, by reinterpreting your relationship to that symbol, to that aspect of your consciousness or again it is all one thing. Therefore when you find yourself experiencing a negative reality understand that you have labeled it negative, perhaps it is a overwhelming symbol that is how your society labels it that in general immediately gets slapped with a negative label. But remembering that it is all neutral you can't turn it around because it also has 100% potential for positive. You also always can have a positive interpretation as well and your near willingness to even look to even think that it is possible to look at what is positive about something that you formally have only labeled negative will open many doors within your consciousness and begin to rejoin the many divisions and segments that you copy your consciousness up to represent. So therefore one of the suggestions that we have made in our interaction with your society and to put it quite colloquial is when something is occurring to you or shall we say within your reality and you are labeling that it is happening to you why is this happening to or me this is no fair what did I do to deserve this that is a label that is an attitude. That is a perspective and when you make that assignment that is the effect you get out. However, there is another way to approach it and this way enables you to utilize even that even that creating you say you do not prefer and the simple statement that will represent the beginnings of allowing yourself to see this is rather than why me why poor and little old me ascribing the statement all right. I understand the negative aspects about this but I also understand that all symbols contain both. Therefore, how does this creation how does this symbol serve me exactly the way it is that simple simple perspective will at least allow you to begin to use even that creation and you will find that when you nail down the positive reason for any creation it will transform. Symbols and events and objects and situations are merely messages from yourself to yourself when you ascribe it in a negative way you remove it from yourself and therefore perhaps are not getting the positive message from the symbol. So very often the result is that the symbol will seem to repeat it will come back perhaps in slightly different sizes slightly different form from its perspective to allow you the opportunity to get a particular message which will aid very greatly in your growth and expansion of consciousness. So therefore understanding this you can begin to be a bit more conscious about it and begin to look at how it serves you for when you get the message that you created the symbol to represent there no longer is the need for it to keep coming back there is simply nothing extraneous in creation if something exists it exists and then by definition it is not extraneous it is not that everything fits in my life except this this is extraneous when you assign that definition you get the effect of something being extraneous but that is a result of the assignment of your particular label or belief. So therefore when asking yourself how does it serve me and going one step further to ask how does it serve me exactly as it already is if you will be honest you will always find something and when you nail down the overwhelming reason for the creation of that symbol it simply transforms changes safe. So therefore if there is something in your life that you feel is repetitive to you that you do not prefer first of all we can assume you have been assigning it either the same or a similar negative label so first of all do not continue if you wish to do that but when you are willing to ask as an owner so to speak of your own reality you would only assume that everything that you have created if you truly believe you created your own reality can be observed in a positive way so therefore by only being willing to look at what the positive perspective is you allow it to transform and take a belief which was formally unconscious and by bringing it to the front bringing it right in front of your face literally you allow it to transform you allow it to become conscious and because we are discussing this and the notion arises that you can continue to create your reality at least from this moment forward consciously you will not continue to create unpreparantial symbol you will continue to now generate a positive momentum however those thoughts those beliefs which resulted in unconscious belief will come up they will allow you the opportunity to integrate them so at first when embarking upon a path such as this sometimes it may seem that things are more negative at first but the reason for this is it allows you the opportunity to take each of these ideas and make them conscious and decide whether you wish to transform it and then if you do transform it so therefore as you transform one thing at a time rather than saying this thing putting it back in the closet so it can come back master and ugliness you begin to clean out the very closet you have created so it is not that you will need to go on for the rest of your life relabeling things you do not prefer and in a sense they make you fool yourself into enjoying your reality no as you do allow these symbols to come up transform and integrate them within you and no longer continue to unconsciously create new beliefs you knock them off so to speak or transform them in or integrate them one by one and eventually you get to the end when you get to the end and have been for that period only generating your reality consciously you then can experience only positive effects now understand you are in a reality that displays polarity positivity negativity so as you expand your consciousness in this way you may become more aware as you will of the positive of many negative things but there is a difference a vast difference between awareness of negativity and experience of negativity and the idea is that you can be and will be as you expand by definition you will be more aware of both but again it will always be your choice to take that awareness and buy into it in a way that you then would produce a effect in your life so therefore you can even though you may be aware of some negativity around you at first only experience yourself the positive this is possible now understand as we share this if you say yeah sure perhaps you are a bit far from believing this and your belief in it or belief that it is not possible will determine how quickly you will be able to live that way but you can use even that creation if you said that's ridiculous everybody knows you have to experience some negative to balance out the positive you can use even that for now that you are aware that you believe that you can choose to believe something else where you should deny it you could not for the only thing that allows you to change a belief that you have that you do not prefer is first again acknowledging or admitting that you have such a belief realizing because you have that belief you feel a certain way beliefs generate emotions emotions do not exist within a vacuum they are results or a response to a belief you can then see now knowing how that belief allows you to feel how it allows you to think how you then ask you act as though you are a person with that original unprepared belief this segues into how you can change that belief or once you have acknowledged it once you own the belief again have acknowledged to yourself how that belief allows you to feel think and act you can utilize your most powerful tools to now drum up a mold or a template for the new preferred belief and this goes as follows once you understand your old belief you then praise to yourself the new preferred belief stated aloud if you wish using your imagination as a tool rather than in a case rather than projecting worst case scenario as a tool that is tuned to the vibration of who you are you can imagine what a person if you wish to place it outside of yourself to make it easier would feel if they had the new belief and using your imagination conjure up that feeling allow yourself to truly feel how you would feel if you had that feeling extending this further you can also use that imagination to see how a person would act that has the new belief what would they do in a particular given situation with that belief how would they act and the simple last step which is perhaps the simplest of all when you are willing to at least sample this idea is to then act that way allow you to imagination to lay down the template of how a person with a preferred belief would act and simply act that way that is what you do anyway with the old belief though unconscious we are now beginning to speak about making it conscious allowing it to be conscious making the new determination and consciously choosing to manifest the new idea you will immediately notice that the actions of the preferred belief will differ from the actions you have been taking so it'll be quite obvious in that regard that you will obviously get a difference but what your imagination is doing is showing you that you contain within you that preferred belief already and that is why you can even project how a person would act you had it and that means because you already contain it you already are it in the moment you are conquering it up that it will be most effortless to simply act that way when you stop yourself from the automatic behavior you sometimes label that you have and give yourself an alternative the old current is being that it is a reflection of the new preferred you will most obviously see more attracted therefore it will be most effortless to do the new thing rather than the old and if you will simply give yourself the advantage or the opportunity to see what that would be there will not be much difficulty in choosing the action that is truly reflective of the you you prefer to be does that make sense therefore your imagination within your society very often again is referred to as an escape a fantasy generating element a projection of worst case scenario but even utilizing the projection of worst case scenario you can understand how powerful it is for when you do that when you imagine something that you feel will happen that will be quite bad which incidentally interestingly enough never really seems to happen but you actually can feel your emotion building up as though you were in that situation you get angry you get in dignity if you get mad you get fearful that is how strong your imagination is that is the negative usage of the tool that we are now suggesting can be used in a positive way it is just as simple to drum up the positive emotion and then feel good about how you would act were you acting according to prep So utilizing again the negative example simply shows you that you are most expert already at using this to simply individuals very often will ever even be aware of the fact that it is a tool and it is a very finely hold tuned to it is tuned to your vibration your imagination is individually tuned to you and will serve you in this way utilizing it in this way most fully and in fact you can extend it to even say that anything any process that you are undergoing in your life your imagination will provide any particular nuances that will cater to you so therefore if you are meditating or doing shall we say something that excites you and your imagination comes up with a particular idea trust it understand that it is a tool and that that is specific for you and that if you trust it you will get a positive result if you will therefore you can always use all your creation no matter what the very worst that you feel is within your reality can be utilized in a positive way and most often the things that you label as the worst when transformed yield the best results your literally your liability become your greatest asset and you no longer feel the need to trip yourself up and simply allow yourself in a positive synergistic growing enhancing way to begin to take back your power to create your reality in a conscious way according to preference with integrity for again the reality is within you nothing is separate from you and your willingness to view all things all events all individual as part of you in some way significant to you part of the creation of your reality is the understanding of your integration with all things when we speak of acting with integrity this is what we mean acting as though you are integrated with all things allow us again before we begin with the exchange and the interaction to briefly note that one of the ways that your higher self so to speak allows your physical self to be aware of what will benefit you most in a given situation translates as a particular emotional vibration that you call excitement anything that moves you anything that gives you joy anything that brings your action to the surface and excites you in that way is a reflection from your higher self that this is me if you are willing to begin to get in touch with what excites you with integrity again an extension of your understanding of integration you will begin to fear your life where you wish it to be for the things that excite you do not do so to tease you they do not do so to go as you sometimes say nah nah or dangle the carrot in front of you they are the vibratory representation of what is chose to be in this life very often individuals will say give me a sign I wish I had a sign excitement is that time that is your specific gauge that is your indication this is me that is why it is time to and not perhaps someone else for it is your game and again when acting upon any opportunity within that excitement utilizing the knowledge of integration within your integrity you will always find a positive result you will always find that thing to be most effortless you will always find though perhaps not always in a way that you expect another opportunity arising from your willingness to act on what is a representation of who you are and you can begin a chain of events whereby one exciting thing gives an opportunity to do the next exciting thing and as you are doing these things because you are acting within your integrity you are being of service to yourself in a positive way again understanding that everybody else is an extension of you you are being of service to others if you are following your excitement with integrity in a positive way and there then begins to be a positive momentum within your life and it becomes quite obvious we refer to the full institution of what we are thinking of of as the ecstatic explosion of coincidence and synchronicity for what occurs is the things you say you desire begin to manifest in your life very often in the most unlikely of ways and you say oh what a coincidence well yet everything's a coincidence co-incident incident is happening at the same time but not an accident for everything because it is all an extension of one thing is interrelated and the one thing may not seem to have anything to do with another by definition they do and by definition anything that excites you because of the representation of who you are is somehow connected to everything else that excites you everything even if it does not on the surface appear that way they are literally stepping stones one to the other and you cannot get to one without stepping on each stone so therefore beginning to validate your excitement and act upon it with integrity and beginning to utilize in a positive way all of your creation will in a very accelerated fashion back in your seat belt propel your life into a life of positive preferential ecstatic joy and at the same time like cut you will be of service to yourself and others and make a positive impact upon your society therefore allow us to thank you for your willingness to begin to open the door that you have in the partitions with which you separate your consciousness into part you are always a 100% consciousness even if you use 90% of that consciousness to make it seem as though you are only using 10% you are still using it all and therefore you can act as one whole homogenous being by simply understanding again that nothing is extraneous and timing is synchronicity as well the timing of things have a particular significance when the seemingly negative things come up is significant that timing allows you to know that if you are willing in that moment to look at it as in a positive way that that is the perfect timing to integrate so therefore allow your timing to be obvious when something comes up you can then deal with it when you ask how does this serve me exactly as it is you need not dig into every little wormhole there simply start out allowing it to be as obvious as possible and when you find how it serves you realize there are other things that you can do other ways other methods other needs to get the same results and begin to consciously act on these other methods and you will no longer need that symbol to punch you in the hand therefore again we thank you for your willingness to begin to harmonize your consciousness and begin to fully realize who you are this is how our society functions and exists and we communicate this to you to allow you the opportunity if you wish there is no insistence on our part to begin as a society to come into your full view and that would then allow us the opportunity to interact with you shall we say in a slightly more conventional manner face to face but we have no desire in that sense to have your power that you are now beginning to take back to be given away particularly to us we do not need or want your power we have enough of our own thank you very much but we are willing to share as equals with you when you are willing to view yourself as equal to us and beginning to utilize determine your reality in a positive way will afford you and allow you that same equality in your own consciousness because again from our perspective you are already equal to all other creations all other forms and expressions throughout the multiverse there is simply no difference in quality only perhaps quantity of focus or expansion we are more expanded but we are not better in any way shape or form simply different therefore I ask you now how may I be of service to you hey man you know I wrote down about you know I wanted to know about excitement tonight funny that you came up with that oh what a coincidence okay I do understand that when we share what you sometimes call the introductory statement within these interactions that from our end so to speak we take a reading again this is quite colloquial of the collective energy and the statements that are then rendered are relevant in some way very directly to all so thank you for participating the question I wrote down was is excitement a decision you have to make a decision to be excited well the idea is the excitement but feeling is quite automatic it is up to you to decide whether you will act upon it or as you sometimes say close it there's something that's been bothering me you see what you said that that we have we've already we've already have something that we made up negative something negative happens in our past and we act on it and something like people take advantage of me all over your past you are saying oh my I made up that I was uh I was a victim oh that who I am who I am being is a person that others take advantage of me and then and that was at an early early age and then I lived my life that's who I was now I got in touch with that and now I'm transforming it but it's very difficult to see what advantage that had for me well in a sense the mere transformation of it allows you to experience it and then in a sense integrate it in a positive way thereby the integration of it winds up being a strength and allows you to deal with other individuals who may be undergoing a similar experience and that will carry more weight with them for when they see you have done it too they tend to listen a little bit more shall we say easily but understand again that the present need not experience the result of the past it is only again labels assignment of meaning the past is done it was completed when it was done it becomes a choice sometimes unconsciously for individuals to continually recreate the past in the present but in that sense you can also use that decide what it is you wish you would have done in your imagination play that out establish the balance and move on please that answer my question oh I was wondering why that and I was doing that to be a living example many times for others who again will then assign more of a readiness to hear what you have to say because you have been through it too very much thank you as you it's greetings from as you continue just a bit on the venue's discussion the subject of sexual abuse this in my experience when it exists in a person's history appears to be a major source of trauma and perhaps apparently inability to transform well again in general in those scenarios individuals having then created what you would call victimhood from unconsciously we're not able to express themselves at that time and it is not always so much the actual occurrence as the individual being cut off from being able to express at that point who they were so our suggestion in those particular scenarios is to again pull out the tool of your imagination relive or recreate which is all you are doing when you say you have a memory anyway you are recreating it you are not reliving it it is done you are recreating it but simply recreate the scenario and do what it is you wish you had done and feel what it feels like to have done what you wish you have done then at least you give yourself a choice to choose which meaning you will assign in the present exactly yes perfect thank you a statement until recently i had only negative associations with the cia which i mentioned as a big negative symbol in previous sessions and what have you seen so well what's the three days after i mentioned the cia in negative terms i read a new york times article in which officials of the cia express the great deal of interest in transforming their whole agency well who had an impact now maybe well i'm not sure what it would be oh you're not oh what perhaps you are the one extraneous thing in creation oh hi at any rate i'd like to congratulate the cia for thinking about transforming itself and we'd like to suggest that they perhaps rename themselves the central information agency and become a source the most reliable public story of information about people and governments in other parts of the world well thank you for laying down such a creative idea and we also suggest that you keep your eyes out for many of the other organizations you have an ascribe the negative label to and allow them to transform it this is the time for it is the transformational period upon your planet during this particular time in your history you will make literally as a society what you sometimes call a quantum jump and you are about to take me therefore you are now beginning to see signs of your willingness to change within your consciousness being reflected in your external reality right right is that perhaps one further question uh along this line all right now uh suppose today i was a um counselor and i had in my in my counseling chamber a great master of suppression such as hitler was or sour and the master of suppression was interested in whatever it was that made you take how could i assist him to transform himself in this particular instance where individuals feel that they must oppress and suppress and impinge in the sense upon others you can begin with the basics merely present the idea of creating their own reality and you will find most often if not always in those situations that these individuals do not feel that they create their own reality when you feel that you create it you can allow creations to transpire when you do not feel that you create it very often individuals will create what we sometimes label a perceived helplessness and that helplessness will generally result in a latching out in an individual attempting to force and squeeze and conform other individuals so that he can feel on some level perhaps he does control his own reality but you never in that sense create your own reality by forcing something to happen reality creation is automatic and is a matter of allowing and in effect if you are engaging in the particular style of activity where you are forcing and oppressing and suppressing you are not in the posture of allowance so therefore your reality gives you the feedback that you are helpless you are helpless you must laugh out you must laugh out you must control your reality rather than again oh wow your reality to change according to preference for changes truly the only company that would be perhaps a place to start in more colloquial language after you have felt out as you say where they are at thank you and also isn't it true that the expressions of extreme negativity such as those we experienced through the Kepler or the product of fear are the product of insecurity are the product of feeling inferior and therefore needing to prove that you are superior but ironically that proving is being done to yourself it is themselves they are trying to prove it figuring if enough other individuals are convinced perhaps they will be leaving themselves but when you do not believe in the power of your own ideas and argue them what you are doing in that sense is convincing yourself wouldn't it be true that to be on that path that to take the rexploration of suppression is today at least a redundancy it's been done time and time again on this planet and there's no further point in a sense yes and this is one of the reasons you are at the pinnacle of the transformational age whereby as a society rather than just as individuals you will transcend the limitation and lack that you have created participated within played out you have done it all you have in that sense had in this particular cycle 25,000 years of lifetime of exploring limitation negativity and separation you have done it all therefore in a sense you can say it would be redundant though there may be some individuals shall we say getting a little in there while they still can well thank you so much as you said it well it's been a very powerful to participate in new cultures so transformation has the word for my reality at this point where all the information I've been putting in over in your series it finally has a process and I'm integrating and well I think that's it so but I feel that your presence you know has has allowed me in my life to act with this process is that accurate well in a sense you can understand that we've been and this is very colloquial it is not precise and assisted streams your planet now that your planet is such that would accept such an idea therefore you match that stream so in a sense you can say we facilitate yes but it will always be you that does the changing and you that takes the action all the things that we share when we are sharing them are only nice information but when you put them into action then you are utilizing them to create your own reality so in a sense you can say that you allowed us to participate but again bring it back home it is you doing so and again we will continue in that sense to provide that function but always remind you and clarify that you are actually doing it for you do not need anything outside of you everything outside of you is an extension of you anyway so therefore thanks for playing we've had some fun do also understand that we never insist in any way shape or form that anybody believe what we are saying because it is us who are saying we cannot empirically prove it to you at this time anyway only you can prove it to yourself nor are we suggesting that what we are saying is better than what any of you are doing simply we are providing an alternative that if it does ring true with you feel free to utilize it and you have done so and I'll continue to do so we thank you in mind okay is that all right specifically I was looking at a skylight in my bedroom about a month ago and I saw a light go across the sky and stop and it was moving right across and it was sort of a large light and I had the sense that it was a ship and it stopped and then we should move further and I never really knew everything more to do elaborate on in a sense you had what you would call a valence party we will not in that sense be specific as to the who and wherefore it would be up to you to get in touch with it but in a sense you have witnessed a class yes was it with a friend of yours well in a sense you can say we're all friends the idea is there is a cooperative association of many worlds who are sharing as equal so I'll move on to my final question I think for exactly the mentally ill largely thanks to and it is probably an overview about our reality of the planet and I'm fascinated by this and also at times very concerned because although it is my choice to proceed with humanity in an inner crisis state because of what we do to our children I realize as much as we proceed at that level but when I view the mentally ill I realize that perhaps they have a freedom that those of us don't so I'm sort of practicing um you know joy and despair and I just want to hear feedback on this process because you know the way in which I feel was crooked in my life right now well again we remind you that not only do you create your own reality but so does all other individuals there are many reasons for individuals to create many realities there's many reasons as there are individuals so therefore there are many many reasons that individuals will choose to shall we say participate in that style of consciousness but again one of the things you touched upon would be quite accurate from our perspective because their focus is so much different than yours this does not mean they have no focus and in that sense where their focus lies and this will vary from individual to individual that is their particular expression of as you say their freedom so they are simply exploring different aspects of reality no less real than yours but not shall we say the mass agreed upon reality while at the same time existing in the same society sometimes some of these expressions will be the result of individuals imposing upon themselves karma in a retribution style which need not occur but that is how some individuals choose to do it but once the expression is created it is a valid exploration in and of itself and many souls will simply choose to explore that degree of highly focused reality whereby the focus is so pinpoint that it seems to exclude 99.9 percent of the rest of the agreed upon mass reality is there something specific you are thinking to explore well man was telling me about this history of hallucinations he would see a man on a cloud and tape and they're lots of muffers well do understand he was not in the classic sense from his perspective hallucinated from his perspective his focus was such that he was simply perceiving a reality which again is not mass agreed upon in your society at least at this point in many instances because they do not perceive such an idea cannot accept that there are other realities he simply thinks the individuals to be insane but the reality he was perceiving from our perspective was no less real than yours so one of the other things that he is then exploring is the relationship and the interaction of one reality with another and the quote unquote societal consequences at least at this time so i wonder if some of these people are closer to fourth density than the rest of our lives it can be again expressions of different dimensions within your third dimensional reality again simply different it can be some more some less some exactly the same though with an altered focus there is no rule of thumb in that way but perhaps you can address if you can be more specific what upset you or what you create because of your interpretation of sedness around well what what really what are the actual and adverse way is the the scale on which children are abused and have been for however many generations then how can you take this feeling and act in a positive way to facilitate your reality innocent feeling this idea within your immediate experience in other words you can ask yourself how you can apply this and that will make the difference and the change within your experience of it well one little girl that i feel i'm witnessing that i'm a witness to her abuse that has been sort of troubling me for the past few days i chose this morning to really realize that was her choice and her experience and to release it now oh why for this does not mean that if you have the opportunity in a sense to assist in a way that is within your integrity that you do not do so it simply means that you do not be responsible for her but only to her so what does that mean so that means what do you feel you should do and what do you mean well i want to approach her mother and tell her that what what i see as as her you know the ignorance of her to her own behavior pattern of her daughter and tell her that it is not her daughter that is acting out but herself and that she's projecting on her daughter and that it is damaging and abusive but i also feel like i have no right to do this how long now why do you have no right lovingly with a positive intention to express who you are this hesitation is perhaps the issue aren't i crossing a boundary for her are you i would think yourself well do you have her best interest in mind but i am passing a judgment about her you are in a sense observing non-integrated behavior well if you simply make note of it this is integrated this is not i shall communicate my understanding of this lack of integration in a loving way because that is the only way they will accept it anyway that is discernment that is establishing your preference if you say this is correct this is not therefore this absolutely stinks and in that way communicate it from that perspective that is judging so it's all in your presentation all in how you choose to communicate what it is you wish to be a vicissive way i suppose in my growing understanding of codependency i feel that perhaps this the impulse to communicate to this woman is coming from my own need that's a question do you wish to continue to allow in a sense what you consider to be the abuse to continue no i don't wish to continue oh understand that you believe this understand that you feel this way and understand that when you in that sense do not make the communication you are doing so believing that you should we are simply pointing out the beliefs not saying you should do this you do that there are no should in a sense yes and that squelching can be frustrating it can be you denying who you are but it also affords you a whole other opportunity which is to begin to be able to make communication about who you are in a loving way you can always present any point you can always make any observation in a loving way if you do the other individual is now in the only conducive receptive state to accept it anyway if you attack they put up defense and then shall we say it becomes almost impossible to make the point anyway so the idea is this you are who you are for a reason you are where you are for a reason you will always have the opportunity to express what you feel in a loving positive way when you do not do so you will create friction within yourself when you do so the results most often or all the time will differ from what you expect for you are coming from a loving positive space the difficulty is not in what is being said it is what is not being said you are not providing who you are in the situation and by allowing it to continue in that sense at least you allow the mother to simply converse with herself when you give another perspective to the mother regardless of whether she should choose to take it or not you at least provide the opportunity for that individual to grow to have another perspective to bounce off of but by in a sense agreeing with the idea saying what you think an individual wishes to hear you will allow them to have a conversation with themselves which does not afford them that growth does that make sense does that help yes it does I I just realized that that was coming from a negative space about this woman which really happened to me and my own experience I guess well understand that not only is it true that anything that you create in your reality anything all your creations can be used in a positive way to allow you to grow it is also true as well with your willingness to communicate in a positive loving way to others affording them an opportunity to grow as well and there can always any communication can be made in a loving way if you look at where your buttons are when you are making the communication perhaps in your imagination to yourself and begin to ask yourself why you have those buttons and begin to look at other ways that you can communicate which actually are more representative of what you feel for you feel this out of love oh let do for now that fabulous thank you thank you you know back there please please I've never heard you channeled before I have a question that has to do with creating your negative reality are you saying things like catastrophic illnesses are things that you bring on yourself or that others bring on that but we are not saying this so that you can ascribe blame to yourself and demonstrate the ultimate symbol of lack of self love guilt we are saying this so that you can realize that the non-preparantal ones such as this ease as an example are usually the product of unconscious police and your willingness even within the scenario of chronic this ease as you say can be rather than continuing to ascribe a label the flavor of which is what this illness does not allow me to do is to allow you to see what the symbol allows you to do that you would not have done without it how does it serve me exactly as it is that allows you to take back your creatorhood in a positive way and that is what that allows you to transform it for all individuals who create the disease also create the cure and there is literally truly no such thing except once an individual labels it as a terminal illness that is a belief and this is why there are many individuals who miraculously are cured of terminal illnesses which are as severe as anybody else's terminal illnesses they have transformed the symbol you can now do so consciously and again one of the most obvious way is to ask an individual all right it is quite obvious what this does not allow you to do and focusing on what it has not allowed you to do has not transformed it but what has it that is entirely different perspective then individuals will usually choose to use in those scenarios does that make sense yeah it was it's not mine it's actually my friends and my mother so I'm wondering what I can do to help the two of them again ask these questions allow them to begin to look at how it serves them as well as how it does not and then when they find how it serves them you can always through your imagination create other ways to serve the same purpose and once they consciously begin to do those other things creating the same effect there will no longer be the need for that symbol does that not make sense it makes sense it's really difficult for me to try to to do that well if you say so then that is so but if you again in a loving way begin to explore these ideas from the positive and begin to allow the other individuals to join you in this exploration then what has formerly been labeled negative the disease will automatically and immediately have the effect of beginning to allow the individuals to expand their consciousness and awareness of their reality by even being willing to look at the symbols in a positive way so your hesitation perhaps you can look at that and when you have transformed that assist them facilitate in their positive way to begin to look at the symbols rather than the actual effect i'm i'm finding some difficulty in trying to try to process that oh right is there some specific point that you are finding difficulty with i guess and having them look at what well have you ever asked this have you ever even approached it from that direction probably not so therefore the doors are not open for you to see the rationale behind what we are saying the simple willingness to lovingly not patronize you and lovingly ask them to begin to look at what this has allowed them to do it will simply be so obvious and the answers will simply begin to come that it will take on its own momentum and you will need not need to assume the responsibility for continuing to do it for individuals who then begin to look at the positive ideas are quite fascinated by it but because you have not even approached it at all you do not have the feedback to see that this is so and that the answers do come up individuals are usually so focused on what the limitation is that they have not even for a moment looked at what it has allowed them to do that they would not have done had they not had that symbol doesn't at least make sense so you have something to play yes because that's really all both of them are doing are looking now at the limitations of what they've got so you will find as even one item comes up you will see a transformation in the symptoms and therefore it will be easy in a sense to continue for that is just a symbol as well and even should they accept your medical profession and in that sense allow themselves the creation of a symbol that cures them it will still be them curing themselves using that symbol so to speak as an excuse in the most literal sense of how you create your own reality you created all the disease the cure all of it nobody ever cures you okay thank you i'll try and approach it from that direction oh no need to try since we do it have a good time play with it you can if you wish have fun with it you can make it into a game it need not be so heavy you can in that sense take the love you feel and the curiosity to explore ideas within consciousness and take me back their power in a positive way in a very light fashion joke around have some fun it need not be so heavy if as this interaction unfolds there are particular ideas that come up as feeling as an obstacle to allow you to proceed in this way please in that sense interact again all right thank you very much happy today um i've created a difficult situation and i just want some help in understanding how it serves me and therefore how i can transform it oh do share and perhaps we can in that sense is it okay i created a situation where i own two homes but i can afford but one so how how does it serve me well in a sense you tell me tell you that part all right thank you um i perceive it as fearful and that it's a difficult situation i don't know how that serves me but i got a sense you have said what is negative about it now how does it serve you how does it serve well first of all your reality is as you have shared what do you wish the reality was i guess i wish i until a situation can be resolved i wish i could uh feel um perfectly at ease with the situation and that everything will be taken care well that is a given but the idea is do you wish to keep both houses no no i'm trying to sell one of them but the market is not great for selling oh and that sense understand that that as well is an idea so therefore you can look at how you are choosing to go about that how you are putting it out so that individuals know that the symbol your house is there and perhaps if you again are utilizing the same symbol and getting the same unpreferred effect you can begin to look at utilizing different symbols even within your society to assist in the advertisement that is there there is a person or person who wish to live there now it is a matter of you putting it out so they can find it okay have you done that to the best of your ability or is there more that you can do i don't know i've given it to the best realtor that i know i've given it out um i don't know what else i could do um is there somebody from your past in a sense who might desire living in that house um maybe Elizabeth but i'm not to my conscious knowledge or our strong sensing is that you can in that sense explore this idea and perhaps the reason that it has not moved in that way is there is another shall we say purpose for it and begin to explore other ways you can utilize the symbol does that make sense no i mean it might but mine's a block so it's all just fans um just a second um are you saying that somebody else wants to live there that i know is our sensing that there may be somebody immediately familiar to you who can benefit by either buying it or in that sense occupying it while you in that sense so okay i don't anybody in this area i mean well the house is not in the area no i'm not i don't know but in any new jersey that i know i'm not aware that i know anyone in new jersey who wants to live there that i'm aware are you saying that i should talk to my friends mention it to them is put it out particularly to the individuals who do not know about it okay that is our strongest suggestion for now utilizing what you have but not in the same old way over and over begin to use as we had discussed earlier your imagination for there may be other ways you can utilize the symbol of that house and in the process of doing so either you will find that or you will sell it that is our strongest perception does that at least make sense so you have something to play with i just couldn't understand it um well when we say that the individuals who it seems to you to be most obvious to contact start there okay that will then open up all the roads you're saying i should be more creative and more assertive perhaps mentioning it and getting out in the universe we are not saying you should but you may i met that will be assisted to you and that will open up shall we say doors that seems to not be there right now okay so utilize your creations your shall we say acquaintances in a more full way and do i make the same i mean do i do the same thing in other areas of my life other than interest in this one well again if you do then you will get the positive effects that we are just nothing yeah okay use all your creation and the title of this interaction okay no accident thank you and he is over there hello everyone and he is very nice to see you again um great thank you as well um and Andrew says this connection is handled through um this evening says well i was in here today the general and i guess to this consciousness well we're knocking so to speak on the door of his consciousness for quite a while before he just opened the door a crack then allowed us in that sense to say hello but the idea is that this interaction and all interactions from our understanding of this nature are products of an agreement in general colloquially speaking these agreements are made in what he would consider to be between line when it is time in that sense for an agreement to culminate shall we say there is not much that can at least stop it from getting at least to the beginning point therefore it was an idea whose time had come and simply it was an example that when this occurs the path of least resistance then occurs it simply will click into place there is no stopping it now part of the agreement was that the individual can choose not to do it in this instance he chose to do it um but prior to shall we say several months of the channeling he was simply not even aware of the idea of channeling but this served his purposes in keeping him focused in other ways that allowed him unbeknownst in a sense to his conscious awareness to acquire knowledge and tools that would actually allow us to have enough materials to work with in that sense so it is perfect timing even down to that degree well okay um at a constant level i am really choosing to um to in my in my way that i'm money which is well in the proportion of my therapeutic massage um i really constantly um attending to attend to attend to my client vibration and um i think what i'm doing is to do is to have some um i guess psychic um knowledge of my final meaning so maybe we make a suggestion again not to sound too simple but the first step will always be to relax you cannot force yourself to tune in tuning in is a matter of allowing second of all understand that all interactions occur within a medium a thick shall we say thickened atmosphere of what you might call unconditional love for the idea is that what you sometimes call tell a pathic connection we call tell empathic connections and we'll have to do with an individual's willingness to identify as another individual who see in a sense through their eyes to walk in that sense in their boot this allows you to create a similar vibration match a similar vibration within yourself and then you then because you are now representative of the vibration closer to their vibration will begin to create thoughts and when you create thoughts while mimicking their vibration their thoughts that you create will be very similar to their hence it will seem that you are reading their mind more accurately is the idea that you are creating the same thoughts at the same time from the same vibratory shall we say awareness so relax allow yourself to feel the unconditional love of creation and allow yourself to tune into them very loosely again from the perspective of seeing as them then and here comes the part where most individuals hang themselves up trust what you get okay the thing is maybe I'm being a little too high on myself because for example today I find I was tuning in and the word I always think that this one word or one phrase and to me it seems like it's something that I already know or that they already know yes but it's not necessarily that you will be illuminating new knowledge as pushing the right button as saying the thing that they already know that will be most significant in that moment it is no accident that you are getting those impressions your willingness to convey them act upon them and allow them to tell you how it's significant to them begins an exchange and tell empathy is an exchange not a one-way line so your willingness to validate on any level what you get act upon it share it will then make it more obvious and then allow you to see that you are in fact tuning in that's great because even if it is one word I understand that it could really be word that exactly before it was and that is economy of verbiage but I never really thought about sharing the message that I got with my client well thanks before beginning to discover this argument well again we only share with you what you already know you only can even understand or perceive an idea if you first contain the therefore thank you for continuing yeah oh I think that had a statement that I'm like you ponder and I thank you do share oh come out just purple okay my thoughts and the energy from this room are we are all above the survival level in our lives in this life you know we all have clothes and we all have a home and food and everything and I guess the statement is that I get the acknowledging that that the people in the world use ghettos to a survival level um I I just don't learn saying I guess I should have a question let's think someone who's on a survival level or what we call it there's where I are they left are they like the woman earlier was asking are they left then they are exactly in that sense equal no they are simply exploring aspects of food they are exploring abundance but through a negative interpretation and then usually continuing to perpetuate it because of the beliefs in notion but the opportunity the idea is that each individual actually has enough power to transform it but again not by assigning it the same label doing the same things and getting the same effect what we have spoken of in this interaction applies to them no less and therefore perhaps your interest in even the subject will allow you wherever your interaction happens to take you in that sense to interact with individuals such as that and allow them to begin to even think about these ideas for they have just as much capability to transform them there is no difference in the density of their consciousness they are simply exploring in that sense an aspect of abundance perhaps a lack of abundance which is an aspect of abundance as well but this does not mean they are locked into it it is only the beliefs and the ideas and buying into everybody knows societal notions that allows them to continue to perpetuate it but they if they were willing to utilize all their creations in a positive way would very rapidly transform and accelerate their reality as well so therefore in whatever way you find it excites you to be of assistance to any individuals you attract go right ahead and then you will simply see what we are talking about they will prove it to themselves that's how fun oh we think so as we at this time it allow us to pause for a short break of 10 to 15 minutes of your county and resume contact at that time
