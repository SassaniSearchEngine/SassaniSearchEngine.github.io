 I want to say, I want you all to say of yours, I must you create time to exist. In the resurrection of day of your time, with the sake of the ideas that many of you have chosen, in your everyone, you'll ultimately choose any aspect of your reality. To view our communication with you, I must decide, I, within the idea of what you have labeled, my philosophy. However, and although that is one choice, all the way to what I did is also that idea, we choose at this time to relate to you that upon our one, within our civilization, within our ideas of our reality. This is far more than the idea of any philosophy. In fact, in actuality from our perspective, what it is that we share with you is, in fact, physics, is in fact, mechanics, and can be viewed in this way and you in this way. It is both, it can be viewed as both. However, when realized that it is, in fact, mechanical principles of reality, mechanical ways and needs in which you can change your choice to live the life that you do prefer for we detect that that is your desire, you will find that this is far more than the idea of people, philosophy, nice philosophy, but now it is really like you are real life down here. We, again, live these ideas and in that they are the ideas that comprise the mainstream, within our civilization of close to creation of reality. We can tell you they are real, they are mechanics, they are physics, and beyond the idea of simply philosophy. We have discussed with you many ways and ideas in how to utilize these principles in your own reality, in your own life, and you may do that any time did you so. One of the ideas expressed to you this day of your time is that in this sense it is somewhat redundant. You can tell about yourself is to explore or find out the idea of what is all that is, what is God and in actuality, the exploration is what are you for God is. Exactly that all that is, and there is not much of an infestation that is heard for, it is everything. However, within the ideas of self-discovering, within the ideas of discovering who it is that you are, our criteria for doing so, and not just seeing a nice philosophy. Our ideas for perpetuating that discovery has been what we have labeled your excitement more than just a philosophy. This feeling of excitement is your way to perceive who you are, to perceive in the property of who it is that you are, and therefore again being the criteria will allow you to transform the life you have chosen to live in negative inclinities, to all life all positive inclinities. As of you we have said, when you do first decide to change your choice, and because you deserve to exist at life, where you may have what you prefer, there is somewhat of a crossover point. Again, once that positive inclinities have replaced the negative inclinities, shall we say those things which you now feel you do not prefer and are relabeling, will disappear from your reality. For as we have said, and will say, and continue to say time and time again and yet each time or the first time, you can only experience a reality. You are the vibration of now, on the family's eye here. Many of you are functioning within being the vibration of a being that does manifest back which you don't prefer. This is an actuality, your vibration many of you have to time. In order for you to transform from that of being a entity, whose vibration is that all that you may also within your experience, experience or manifest back which you do not prefer, the way to change this idea again is in action. As the idea of, say, give it to your naked, that is not in a sense being instanthered to yourself, your, as you say, acting as if philosophy or way of proceeding is a mechanical, physical, principle that does change your workplace when you proceed and within your belief system is the idea that you have always created a certain portion within your life of things which you do not prefer, and therefore you can only assume that you will continue to do so, you act a certain way. This perpetuates that vibration, the idea that you can create a life that you do prefer, that is the static towards the left everything that you desire in and of itself is not sufficient to change your vibration for such a life, however, it is the beginning. It is a place to begin, since you have the beginning and ending within your linear time frame, however, again, what will physically raise your vibration is physical action, and that physical action, the tone of that physical action is determined by the idea of your belief, your underlying feeling and therefore, by relabeling back in your life that you do not prefer as something which, obviously, must be here for reasons for you and not create for no reason, you are not as strange as creator just as all that is is not as strange as creator you will affect then assume the attitude that will result in different actions, that continuation of these different actions within that attitude of owning your reality does allow you to transform and as you proceed in that manner, your vibration and believe he when I say this, if you do, does change, when it does change to the vibration of an entity who only creates what he does prefer, you cannot cannot attract reality, you no longer sleeper, it will disappear from your life, there will be nothing left to relabel, this is what we have been trying to tell you, and again only you can prove it to yourself if you decide that as you have broken yourself down into the idea of your percentages, certain percentages, certain percent that, that you will do 50% what excites you, you will have a 60% retro actual life, you'll have the other 40% in there, that's how it works the degree of your thought results in, the degree of change in your actions results in the degree of change in your own reality, therefore at any given time, all you need to do, totally at this moment, change your own reality to that of ecstatic, joyful reality is way, and what is immediately available to you to do at any given moment, and using only that in those choices, which you are excited by for that is your aloe, that is your honor I realize we consistently, freaky this idea, that is all there is to it, it is that simple, and if you think about it, if you decide right now, because that's the only time there is, that you will only do, that's which excites you from the choices you have in your life well guess what, you start having a good time right now, and that changes your vibration, that does not allow the things that you do not prefer to exist within your reality, this is how we live our lives all the time, you can do and that is the only reason we are able at this time to even communicate with you, for this is within your grasp, your reach, your realm, your pain, your density, and that is why we are able to co-create and share with you in this manner also, it is very much fun, we do enjoy so interacting with you on this level, at any level that we interact with you upon, and there are many levels you exist at all levels simultaneously right now, and although, due to the focus, you decided it shows that you are inferior, you may not honestly be aware of that, it is so and by definition, hours now, what we have labeled for density, that which you are currently transporting to as we speak does have and contain less of that idea, there is less of a focus, you are still an individual, you are still physical but it does not mean that you say so outrageous, that these simultaneous existence are real, you are, shall we say more access to them, understand, you have access to them now, you have chosen to be focused in this way, we assume that responsibility for again it is the key, by saying this stuff doesn't work, there are things in my life I do not prefer, you are choosing not to own your reality, you are choosing to perpetuate this idea of separation you are choosing to continue to experience limitations, and as we have said, you are the master of limitations, you are masters of that idea, you are slated out in every way, shape and form your time within this reality, you may, as we measure anything you desire, continue to do stuff, however, as it points you have done it all and as you say, one of the next steps that is available to you is the idea of this transformation, therefore we present you from our perspective what has worked very nicely within our civilization, we understand that even before our civilization if we present what you would call click into the idea and how to experience what you call our coming of the collective consciousness, what you call coming of the Christ what we call shakana, that prior to this idea we were by the definition of our chosen reality and shall we say a little bit more python inherently than you are, but this is no way shape or form that this is not available to you now, and our present year is the validation of that idea which you seek now again spoke at some length about the idea of validation and the smooth, the immediate of five validation week to win two validates again, validation is a two sided coin by validating the reality of others that in your past belief systems you would not have been believed and in fact that was untrue, by validating that it is true, think we have what you prefer by validating you are automatically validates as it is two sides of the same coin, it is not just we are going around saying go and validate things and you will not be validated yourself you will agree with you are able to validate other other points of view, others reality, to that degree exactly is the degree in which you yourself will receive the validation which you do seek for we perceive that you do seek these validates and simply now shall we say, approach this somewhat as you say back work, you will get these validates external validation once you validate because your validation of others in a sense for others are simply an extension of you in your goal one thing, all while the universe which is also used to validate you back in a sense it is somewhat of what you have labeled again, a game of perspective for it is always creating it all anyway but it is not a creative way with a certain parameters and one of the ways to access the idea of view if you are validating feelings of things you will leave have validation is to validate there has been much raising an individual and collective web browser vibration that goes within this group is perceptible not only do they validate the vibration of these validates you can triple out into some of your worlds to be felt by all on some level whether or not they are confident or what that is, you do make a difference to each and every individual in your own, this also does ripple outward into what you call space into what you call the universe and in some of our analysis to the idea of as you say a part with which you draw a stone into the very center of the part, the center representing your planet well those ripples created by the dropping of your stone into the water do in fact actually reach the outermost parameters of that month the very edge, the very sure of that month and not in a decreasing manner they expand, they amplify, they grow, these stones create a ripple, a small ripple the size of the stone, however, when that ripple does reach the parameters, all that you take apart, it is quite larger and confidence in fact this is a very explosive analogy for the impact that is changing your vibration will make not only to you, not only to your planet but to as you say the entire universe, the entire creation and fact very exciting, we are excited by us, we like to feel your little bleed, be tossing your stones into the pond, we enjoy them greatly, by the time they reach us to operate species, they are quite strong and quite exciting for this is the only reality we can experience, one of very exciting all the time, we do not perceive what you perceive as ours for system values, these negative ideas of which you see as being manifestable, we understand the variety, we understand that it is bold but we only are experiential within the positive ideas, negativity as you call it, cannot experientially touch us, there is not as you say, an occasion of all, when it happens upon our planet, it does not exist as this is the reflection you use, that's the thing is indeed upon if you can simply feel that you deserve it, again from our perspective whether or not you do perceive that you deserve it, you do, an infinite creation, if so unconditionally loving and accepting of you, that if you feel you do not deserve it, it will allow you to be undeserved I know this may sound strange to you within your reality, but that is unconditional love, the ability to allow any manifestation again, any manifestation that you do create is a perfect creation, we have used the analogy that even when you choose to create there, I get a misery, it is perfect misery and therefore you now have all kinds of events, if all kinds of many kinds of things is in and of itself, the value that will allow you to accept it, however you may have any kind of a secret stepping, have the reality that everything is that simple, understand we are not saying that we are in the universe, within reality there are no complexities for from that standpoint, from the analytical standpoint, complexities do exist, they are very real and they are one of the choice, you can make things as you have noticed, very difficult for your soundness what we are simply suggesting is that another openness reality, another choice is that it is that simple, another note we wish to make to you at this time, or we are noticing a strong propensity for this idea, is the idea of intention and detail many times, there is not so much the idea of that you do not figure out what it is you desire, what is you intend, however you generally have in your whole society, blame for the others, detail, it must occur and in certain ways, otherwise I will not believe it is the courage all right, you can have it that way, but it does not have to be that way, what we have noticed is that it is thought within your society a propensity toward in your concentrating on the details, the details to accept and manifest your new reality what we have shared with you and we shall again share with you is the idea that you do not have the ability analytically to take into consideration all the parameters and very often these details must come and will not accept my creation are not even close, not even close to being the path of weak resistance, and this is the path everything takes, in a sense it is a sub-war of your particular reality, but we use the word law loosely the path of weak resistance, therefore you concentrate on the details, we suggest that what we have experienced and what we have seen individual in your society in the schooling this belief system this approach of which we speak your approach will be more shall we say think relates to you, few, without your clear intention, what it is that you want in a very vague fashion, an overall idea clearly, intention, clear intention then proceed in any given situation, realizing that what starts you the most in any given situation is the path of weak resistance, then you get to have a lot of fun and the details take care of themselves very often being hung up on these details is what holds you back, you can have it that way, we are not saying it cannot come, so very prescribed, where does your eyes weigh, that you assume it must come, it can however generally it tastes a lot of time and the other thing we have noticed is you are all in very much of a hurry, to have a good time, you are approaching in somewhat of a paradoxical manner again, we share this with you, causing it into the fact of things that are all available to you, to experience your own hours, we have spoken again about the idea that a miniscule, a miniscule, very small change in your perspective very small makes a great sweeping change within your hour, in both which you have labeled your future, which is being created from the present, and your path which is being created from the present, a grand sweeping change again, it all falls under the category of it is that simple, therefore validates, therefore duet sides, therefore be clear with your intention and a lot of the details, you take care of themselves, I assure you, I guarantee you 100% and how often do you get that or equal, a guarantee upon your planet that this can and will work, however you are the only one who can prove it, who can and will into action and who can begin your out of it through time again, one of the perplexity to us about your civilization is the fact that you are insistent, insistent on holding on to your limitations, your separation, while at the same time claiming to which you transcend them this is a paragraph to us, however we do understand that it arises from your perception, which again is a reality, but that the path results in the present again, you can choose to let go of this idea by saying that the present does not result in the path, you, in a very real sense, cut off the shackles that you complain about therefore, we have as you say, given you the key, it is your choice to drive the car, we suggest you may choose to take a little ride around the block, see how the view is, see how comfortable the ride is, open windows, enjoy yourself, say hello to your neighbor some half of the time in appreciation for your willingness to continuously interact with us on this level, in appreciation for you being in back to the wrongs of your civilization, allowing me to be a back to the wrongs for my civilization we ask you now, how many we be of service to you, understanding again that open the free, you are being of service to yourself, our existence here is simply your giving yourself, and a wow-able format to communicate with yourself again, how one of the removal of responsibility, but this is the way in which you have chosen to grow, chosen to reflect yourself, and in a sense, we enjoy very greatly therefore, again we thank you for your willingness to create with us in this manner rather than unconventional or unconventional manner in your class and after now, how many we felt you shared? Yes, last year, yes, close to you, couple of things, I wanted to come back to you from our last time, we have talked about the situation with my body, and I did do as you say, found the difference in change and then you ruled out that I totally eliminated it, but it's like, and what I discovered is when I was doing it, I felt like the change came about and I realized, instead of course saying, I'm one homogenous being when I was letting, when I was letting, when I was doing whatever it came to my mind, which was often throughout the day I did that, I could feel that change, and the act of the other started coming true, so that was really good, and then the other aspect of working with my son, and we were still falling into the thing, but I'm also working with that, and I still have a change within myself, because what I'm working for now is I did that relationship, and I was just a wild year of appeal, one of you learned from that situation, realizing that anything had to be gleaned both of us all positively well, that we can't do that simple, thank you very much, you're getting here, it really is best difficult, and you can't have reality where it is truly difficult, we don't need to convince you of that, however, since what's it means, is a lot easier and the other thing is, you knew from me thinking that Mary, she had that special meeting this week about my, I'm actually a baby of picker life, and I didn't experience this week for that, so when I fully, you know, retired, I wanted to experience a relationship with the society on a personal level go right ahead, that is available to me, so I did, and it's only not because I invited them to share their life with me, and even just in sympathy of being with me, as I knew about my life every day, and the things that I do, and it's what times two is also non-hiring, those expectations, just more than wonderment of how it will happen, you know, like what's around the next corner with it, and I also realized that there was more here on that side than there was from my side Mary shall we say the idea of equal, after you answer, but it is only again a lack of trust on both sides, and reconciling of this idea of lack of trust benefits both civilizations greatly it is in a sense one of the barriers that has allowed those interactions to be perceived as somewhat violent, somewhat small to a somewhat unrealing however, by the reconciliation of this trust which as your architect can be done, slowly but surely are a psychic, mental, consciousness level you may remove those barriers, and with it, the fear that those interactions will lead to a girl in an unpleasant, as you say, matter oh I have, I have, I want to have fun with it, and I think that now that I totally made it into this, this is what I decided to do, and I want to open myself up to it, it's like a cat, it's coming, a concealer and it's eating right now, and it's nice because you play five, you know, come on, let's go for a walk I have a few questions, what will you do with this, for again, it all comes down to what will you do? well, when I listen to you talk a while back when you do the language you can't be used, saying that our company together with another device which brings back a katana, yet it is sent again, for those who may not people know you with the eye here and our civilization is a product of the blending of your civilization, and the idea of things of ridiculous civilization in many ways, not only physically a cross-section of the two having character-if-if-if-if one, character-if-if-if-some-and-all-the, but also social means, structure a lead with it all of society, it is a blending of both energy, the energy of group mentality while at the same time individuality, not needing to be mutually exclusive as you are believed, therefore in a very real sense we love you, on a level you may not have realized for, we are very, very rich on the lead, your children and we appreciate your allowing us to have the opportunity to exist in this fashion, in a sense an interesting thing has occurred you have allowed us to exist, we have come back and in a sense facilitate your development so that you may use only very interesting cycle and if you choose and only if you choose you may be a very direct part of this idea, now we wish to share another idea with you which we may or may not have shared, in a sense you may in effect think of this blue eyes well alright, the idea of the United Nations of Violence for each and every one of you have the opportunity if you choose you do not have to, there is never a force to be an ambassador to a different civilization we have known it again, in your state may for the same ridiculous life, we have known it in your state, in your state, hey at all, for the idea of all we are in it and we shall allow at each and every one of you to discover your connection that they may be very different from one another this effect is one of the functions of this group, there is not just one function of this group, there are many, this may be in certain one so when we say to you you are an ambassador, you are, and in a very real and diversified sense, again it is up to you do you have a personal question or share it? oh I just wanted to give back to that as you explained what we know I indicate, that at that time when that came up I thought I would like to do that, I would like to give... does it sign to you? oh yeah, that's something easy, we say more, I just say more, I don't mean that we are not our Tuesday style, when you are also a year again, just making out, maybe I want to comment on your verbalness right, so I knew, but I also didn't have to work decent years to talk and read your concerns, but I knew it was very vital to the A to the A and that individual I have reconciled many of these ideas, incidentally, I know I proceed that too, and I have grown in the letters after I made anyway the fact that we are doing what we did do on that, but they are all not too much to interrupt you again, no extraneous creation, you in a sense were exposed to one way these interactions can't occur this in effect is not saying this is how the interaction must occur and in effect gave you an opportunity to decide that you may not wish to create it in that way again, nothing wrong with that way, but shall we say so, let me know, right, no, no I understand that, and then also recently reading an article on the history of the particular and out of that, the person channeling came in from anything that there was a negative aspect and a positive aspect, and of course from my blog, do you want to come in from, I just sort of checked out the negative aspect and on the surface one moment, one moment, again we realize it is terminology, but we cannot check out anything, the more mechanical way in which this will not even exist within your reality in this follows by my braining at the positive, even if and it does, negative exists, it will not find even an effect, you will create very riddly a parallel earth that does not exist upon therefore, the only thing which may be what you call, in pedemic or what we realize there is no such thing is any residual fear that you may have about this idea not that we sense that you have, we are really saying this for the benefit of all, but again, if one says well, but sure I have that fear, and if simply, is there, what should I do about it, we always tell you to use your fear as an opportunity to decide what you skill must believe you have that fear, and in that way, a fear is a very certain thing, sorry, just, sorry, it was just happened, that is all for you you realize that you do not like to be in the often and we are respecting that space in your language, thank you very much, okay, and I just wanted to add that as far as the whole thing is concerned Mary also came up with a time spanner within a year, and of course, after I got to thinking about that today, I decided that I wanted to also shorten that time span the time spanner will be perfect, I am sure it will not disappoint unless you put the expectations that it must be this detailed model I was working on how you were talking to other times about people manifesting how you be sure that time some five months to one month to 30 days, I was working the best of those believers, from that point, playing with it, not just playing with it, part of the playing of it, evolving along with it again, we are not as you say, knocking you in any way, no, I am saying that by saying to me, I can be burning the ghost within a certain time frame that is a detail, if that is your clear intention that you can refer that, and you can forget all about it other than that is your clear intention and act upon what it starts with, even the time it will be that which you desire, but you don't want it the time you also doesn't vow for this is a co-creation, there, time and I am going to score off of it, but that is also part of where I am working with my dream, one moment, we will be there, the question is on the table, which is for Josh, so we don't have to remember, never in this option I am going to convey it to you very much OK, ready? Yes, I will take care of it OK, um, like one, so, one moment, did you know what that was? And, E-V-E-V, one moment, yeah, it's his name, one moment, who is in a very real sense, a part of these interactions and his other levels, communicating with us? OK, thank you very much, thank you very much for your bold share, enjoy this idea and as you say, keep us in the board, thank you very much, thank you for sharing, yes, I am a human and I am a human, we have in our presence this day of your time, another, eh? Just like, a popular name on the board, does that mean you are not an individual? Does that mean that you are not a special individual? On the west coast, Luana Yoo-en is in process of compiling, as you know, some Beshara transcripts as channeled by Daryl Yes, we are somewhat access to this information through the theological channel OK, and she asked me the other day for some kind of a blur for the book, a blur, a blur is a... OK, I am wondering whether you would honor us with a blur about as channeled through Andrew about the work by the Beshara's channel through Daryl Oh, right, we are very excited by that as well OK, one more, how interaction with you goes through, eh? The only constant, the reality is that things are constantly changing, very many as you may call faith, very many as you may call verse That version was our initiation verse of our relationship on your planet, since which time they have been, as you say, many options That served a great purpose in more than just that way, for as we have told you, that physiological life was in fact The physiological incarnation of my own self upon your planet, I have only had one that was it By my ability to incarnate in that fashion, and again, in that sense, I am at this time, incarnated upon your planet as Daryl That was what allowed us to appreciate, experience your vibration, to be able to communicate with you otherwise We would be far through a failure to have these interactions We are very much different from you than you may imagine Even in your imagination, within these parameters of how we are, you are only, shall we say, partly touching the idea For you choose the limit your self to your current perceptions Therefore, you have some idea to filter through your beliefs, your society of what we are like, but in fact we are far more alien than that What will allow the commonality for us to interact, face to face, as you are far from the same Is the installation of the ideas of which we speak into your life again, which will already show physical vibrations That individual has served many options and is still within that capacity It is still serving those functions We still, even within this format, choose to communicate through him from time to time But understand that we are also communicating through him through what you call the project and drama Again, it is his project, we are not taking that away from him But again, and it gets sketchy and I know he is using to you, he is dying Therefore, to answer your question, we are very pleased with the progress that has been made We are very pleased with his introduction of us into your side In due allowing our vibration to be present to attract that, as you will, which in effect this group is Attracting all those individuals which enable us to communicate with you in slightly different versions Again, this is a different version of the same energy Does that answer the question? Yes, wonderfully man, it raises another question All very good That is the phrase away What is citing me about this group is that we have a possibility to operate as an amplifier of your message on this planet That is good But not by walking around and talking, by walking your talk Rosie Okay, I will part and answer my question But I am wondering about specific ways in which we might realize that intention to amplify the word Doing videos, for instance, doing public meetings I don't know, a movie, a creative movie Does it excite you? Yes So, right ahead Oh, thank you very much Do you have another question? Several Well, indeed, as you said, nobody Oh, alright, I am very interested in the subject of induction right now And I am wondering how you can do it one moment Oh, I am sorry We need to turn it into terminology And put it any detail And for it to say So, even meaning that abduction is a judgment That you have not agreed to the situation and you are not creating it And for any detail in the know-ever Is more the idea, although in the deliberation of language, Rosie Okay I am wondering how many civilizations are involved in temperate payments In effect, the temporary detainments of which you speak one or two Primarily one state or a tick-a-lie Many of the interactions with all of our civilizations are not of that age And again, part of rationale Four, those interactions are as was pointed out At re-action On both sides Rosie Okay, I have a friend like an named Rusty Hudson They are not many friends Yes, he is many people He is many friends You all are Yeah And I am wondering Which civilization he specifically Is a viditase or followed You know, on a continuing basis How do you communicate in his ideas on the matters he knew? Two degree And what I have heard By hearsay Rosie, define Well, he experiences himself as having implants A little device by which he is monitored And he is appearing in his room And is having the ceiling open They look a bit lost light Insect light Are fairly tall But some of this is hearsay I am not sure, it is Two, two, one And our perception Much of it is the idea of hearsay Or, as you say, the game of Elpham Whereby Communication of ideas from what individuals When others shall we say, get the vid called Built it? Yes Again, do you wish to create a reality And earth, where such a thing does exist? Where such a thing is what? Exists What's like creatures and implants into your brain I know, I know That is a choice You may wish too very carefully You cannot vote, you cannot either You cannot have no idea It is up to you We are not saying that it is not real Follow me on the same time as I'm again Everything is real What do you wish to experience? What do you wish to attract? Are you there? I am indeed I do understand the point This is much the idea we have discussed with you I get it all right in energy You may never need to see or experience that I'm getting a deed With those spirits As you say, have well, earth that does not even contain This is the physics This is the result of living in such a way Your vibration will be such that you can only be within a reality of life vibrations In your society You have a thing I'll put this attract Although that may be true, any very loosely defined magnetic sense It is not true in a vibrational sense Like attracts Like Prosy Okay, a question about manifesting For instance, I get some contradictory information From different entities yourself And you know, the monster Monster asked me for a detailed description Of what I wish to do Manifested, namely a vehicle Whereas you recommend more simply I need a powerful reliable vehicle That will enable me to remove from this point to that point Very rapidly without a great real hassle Now, in contemplating the process of manifesting I observed some counter-intentioning In one way, for instance I'm just playing As you may or may not know We could notice it very quickly There are all kinds of complications in the sense That arise around even the ownership of such a vehicle In one way, if a futuristic vehicle was an incredible engine Which I would really love to have Around water, for instance I would love to have such a vehicle Yes, there's a consideration in me That I shouldn't have that That this civilization wouldn't be ready for that No one would understand that I probably couldn't even worry Incidentally, you are lying down rules like that Rosie? I find that lying, sorry I understand But also what we have The licensing for seniors And we have insurance, we have this and that When it comes to a vehicle, I find myself with a lot of reservations Even simply about the ownership of the vehicle Is it then any surprise to you? That you have not manifested the same And also, why? Resistration, insurance, etc. Are details Decailed details, you know? Do you have any focus on the details? They will become very real They will become inevitably choose the creative in that way They are detailed Rosie? Well, okay, if you were in my position What would you Posterate as The object that you desire? What would you have clearly in mind? What would you really desire? Do you understand? How would you possibly? Yeah, I'm having a bit of difficulty How is learning? Okay, how would it be? How would I make that postulate So, I really did want an excellent vehicle But I won't have the same thing That is your postulate? Yes Oh, I have an excellent video soon, video Period If you have all that ideas, you want to get to do this, you want to get to do that And you do not concentrate on those ideas They are not forgotten All that is, does it not see that? You will find by, again, paradoxically Not focusing on the details The more you do not focus on the details And focus on what sounds exciting Very strange, as you say These details are also worked out When you stop deciding that I think should be a certain way And relax Paradoxically, very often It does come that way And while concentrating on the details, it does not Do you understand? And I understand How do you follow along? I am following, yes Does that answer the question? Yes, it does You sound I'm in that line, close in I've been looking at my own process here As a problematic one As part of the At situations you will not allow to transform? What I've been manifesting in the sense Is looking at the process of manifesting From the point of view of an earth being It seems what complications may and may arise In what way? Mumble bubble life And seeing the registration before the details All the details, right So the clarification that we're creating today Is important to me because that is the fulfillment of my manifesting Looking at manifesting Yes, and let you all know that We have noticed again You have a child we say And you are focusing on the details You must have all the details in line or you'll be in trouble But again, that is actually that focusing on the details Keep those details away many times Again, if you decide to impose these parameters You can manifest those parameters However, generally, not within the time frame you prefer It takes longer, it is not the path of resistance You have living examples of this around you right now Thank you, one related question Incidentally, the automobile Acquired by the physiological child Was at a path point presented to him He was, in his opinion, not able to take care of the details And did not receive the automobile Autologically, when he had forgotten all the hours That automobile goes detailed And the need for a new floor of transportation arrived Well, guess what happens And guess what was taken care of? This is yours, good and strange And good and good It works that way and it is that simple You have all the examples of this idea, do you not? Yes, but I have a related question, I don't want to lose Oh, you know it's not going to come out more well It is all about democracy Now there is something in life which we have to do, which we are never excited about Such an... It's going in income to explore How do we handle that? If we follow the principal Now we will step in again as you are focusing on the details But to ask, let's take care of our details And somewhat of a human race matter H and R block You do not have to do anything that you do not become You have to do it as a definition You can have to do it, but do you prefer to? Well, alright Thank you very much, thank you We proceed on somebody's take off phone on your phone And if you look at the phone, you have to say that this session Does not have to feel that way though By living on I have to be Do I not? No, I do understand, I appreciate one of the effects that I came to this independently If I am independent Which I am not If one is ecstatic enough, one creates such an abundance All of the details such as showing out forms and dealing with the officials Which sometimes make lives very difficult But one doesn't have to go through them And choose to allow them to make your life difficult Roti? Well, my point was that if one's creation is high enough You don't have to confront what many people would regard That the officials and the stateful actions Or you will not accept that there is anything within your reality That is vicious and faithful In other words, either the details will be taken care of by a two-day seminar Or by you with a new approach It is all point of view It is all your label of any situation Neutral, everyone, feeling out of that form is a neutral situation You have in your old society in a very celebrated way, made it negative However, it does not have to be so In a sense, you have used it as a symbol Of simultaneous belief Separation of you from your government And at the same time, unification You can choose to buy into the unification Again, we ask that you are your government If you choose to proceed that way And therefore, giving money to yourself should be no problem, as you said You understand? Yes, I understand Point of view It changes the whole reality It is not too simple to be true But what if I am not too sure that I like what I am doing, as government That's the meaning of the government Then, protein, impalpative action And as we have said, you made you Instead of the idea of road-ath to subject They are very receptive to this idea We have spoken about from time to time the idea of letter By being through your own officials They read these letters In their way of typing into you If many individuals send these letters Well, shall we say they get a sense that that is The opinion of their constituency You are very close to your government You are one of the things And in a sense, letter, writing You are one thing, phone call, and then you are one thing Any of these ideas that are within your excitement We have suggested writing to your officials Each and every day, the idea of how I prefer speech I give very much to the early accelerants This will have an impact They will get the idea You are in communication and it is that simple Do you have another question or would you like to continue The question you were asking? No, thank you, my question is every answer Thank you very much, that is factored Oh, very good For as we have said Clamification is everything Do not settle for being un-clarified Do not settle for the full ask of the audience Let's bring it down to maybe real Let's get back to basics If it seems again we are like eating these ideas It is because they are the ideas Which you seek to change your reality Say it!
