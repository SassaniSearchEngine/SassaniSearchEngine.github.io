 I've been doing readings this day of your time as you create time to exist. Reading and my love. Receive and return. What is it you wish to discuss this day of your time? Well, we set up basically so that we could answer Evelyn's question in Florida. She's from late point of vista in this last April that she presented a question. And we would like to get that cleared up with her so that she has an answer if you can elucidate on this. Oh, right. By all means, do you? Right. What her original question was was what areas of my soul still need to be brought to the surface prior to hands-on healing? Oh. The assessment of there being a surface and at the same time a deep submerged portion to our consciousness would be the place to begin in that understanding that you are one whole homogenous consciousness. Not a collection of parts, though you may express this wholeness in the exploration of the idea of parts. Part and parts of what you call health or healing is simply the ability to shift your point of view to express the idea of wholeness, hence one of your terms holistic. Generally speaking, pain, this ease and discomfort are caused by the resistance to the idea of wholeness itself. So therefore wholeness, one consciousness, allows you to know in no uncertain terms there really is no deep submerged portion which must emerge before you can express the idea to assist other individuals through facilitating their own healing. Now one of the things we often discuss is that individuals you refer to as healers, technically speaking, foundationally speaking, do not literally heal anyone else but themselves. All being, being perfect and total creators creates their own disease, creates their own sense of wholeness or health. Now we do not say this so that individuals who have created the experience of this ease will judge themselves for having done so. You do still as a society play the game of hiding pieces of yourself from other pieces of submerging portions or packets of your consciousness inside shall you say your own consciousness. And therefore individuals who create the idea of disease are in general not aware of having done so and did not do so on purpose with that specific aim in mind. There are individuals who do by the way but that is a different story. But the idea is the first realization that one can be healed is the idea that everything does emanate from within and therefore an individual will at least have the notion or create the connection to the idea that they will have something to do with their own healing process. The healer is a facilitator, a teacher, a coach, perhaps an energy conduit. But the idea being that they really provide the atmosphere whereby an individual will heal themselves, will find it more acceptable to create what you call the cure, to create the restoration of health, and then often then credit the healer for having done the actual work. One of the important roles of anyone functioning as a facilitator or healer in this particular age of the expansion of consciousness is the idea of allowing the individual to be empowered enough to know that they have participated in their own healing. Generally at first in the way that your society plays with each other, you may set up the scenario that you will heal them. That allows them to then give their power away to you, and then when you facilitate them through your process, they then give themselves permission to heal, literally speaking, using you as an excuse. So if at the end of that process you were to do them the service of saying, oh, by the way, you did all the healing, you are truly giving the full benefit of your service, which is to assist individuals to re-empower themselves to experience themselves as all beings, and when you do allow yourself to come to the conception that you are a whole being and begin to prove it to yourself, this ease cannot exist in that atmosphere. So again, firstly, transform the notion that there's something inside you that must come out. Everything you need is right there, right now, always, and if you are willing to say, I always know what I need to know, when I need to know it, you will then zone in or hone in on what you need to know and begin to trust what you get, which is part two, trusting what you get, each individual attracts all situations in their life, you and all what you perceive to be other individuals as well, and therefore it will be up to you to recognize that as that individual attracts you, you will have something to offer to them. Now being the best you that you can be is being willing to give your unique perception, your unique opinion, putting that out there is really your only job, trusting who you are, trusting what you get, allows you to be most consciously of service to others but also to yourself. So when you enter what you call a healing situation and your intuition begins to provide you with things, if you are willing to act upon those things, share those things, trust that the very form in which something occurs to you is the perfect form in which the situation warrants your participation, then your level of success as you sometimes label it will begin to seem to increase exponentially, realizing that you are a whole being and trusting what you have to uniquely offer as being the thing that any individual who attracts you attracted you to reflect back to themselves. So for starters that will do. Is there anything else? Well that was basically the level of question and it's interesting that I had heard that you took it differently than I had taken the question, it's funny because I took it prior to hands on healing that she was going to go to a healer and I think you addressed it more as that she was going to be doing hands on healing. She is also the healer but it is both. The other idea is that as you have brought forward, switching the positions in this instance allows her to see that any external source that she will access in order to achieve a cure will truly only wind up being her willingness to allow her to be able to achieve her. And she has a willingness to allow herself to see herself as a whole being and to allow herself to heal herself, whether anyone else's hands are on or not. Which kind of gives a little segue into the question that I was going to ask more at the end but I think it relates more now because I've been working with playing with the idea of the blue-green algae and getting back into seeing the nutritional bio-chemical support of the body. Now I know ultimately that the opportunity is the least and what's put the least in. When I first started doing this, I had to look and see what my core beliefs are and yes, I do contain the belief and do operate in my life on the belief that we need to have certain nutrients and you, by the way, a majority of individuals upon your planet, the mass consciousness expresses itself with the understanding that external sustenance must be forthcoming to sustain yourself in this reality. Therefore, working within what you perhaps will refer to as the natural confines of that subject, what sources can I access that are relatively natural is still a step toward expanding away from that concept. And when you exist as an energy being, the exchange will be far less concrete, the exchange will be far less apparent, and the understanding that you do actually create your own substance from within will be more obvious. However, for now, in the gradient way that your society allows itself to expand, a tendency toward a more natural idea is an expansion in and of itself. That's why this really caught my attention was that it is harvestable, totally natural source with such a broad range of micro nutrients available to us. But now I've been seeing that there's two other things that have come to my attention is that besides the algae, it's a potent antioxidant. The one I'm exploring right now is called synoginal and it comes from the specific pine bars that are harvested in France. And the other one being co-entime 210, which is also called ubiquinone, meaning that it is in all cells, if you have any comment on either of those or any of the three. Specifically speaking, they are what you are referring to as supplements. So you are still supplementing your system, but they can function, again, depending upon your belief in a beneficial way, where it will allow you for the expansion, which generally will be to the point where supplement is no longer necessary. That ultimately you do create the whole reality and it does follow from that. You are a complete being and do not need anything to supplement your energy or supplement your consciousness. You are already everything. You contain the idea of supplement as well. One of the ideas I had is that you take a triangle of mind-bought experience, similar to the ERC of energy-reality communication with the mind, but is that when you bring up the biological sport, even though you are facing it out of belief structure that you need it, it also can allow you to bring up your consciousness and spirit. There is no need to minimize the idea of the characteristics of a belief system. Once you believe that, once you commit to that, once you decide that, it is true. So it is unquestionably so that you can experience it in the way that you are sharing. It is true for you. Yes. It is. So we will go on. Oh, right. Where are we going? We are going to questions from William. Trick question. You are going nowhere at home. We are already everywhere. You are going nowhere at home. What? If you wish to nail it out. He says this reading in his love. And I will read specifically. As you know, I am holding down the introductory language for my book. of life. I am choking the vow of integrity as you have suggested. I'm also including... By the way, yes. Only suggested. Only to look at it from all angles, not as a rigid rule tilt the vow, but simply as a concept, play with it. Be willing to be spontaneous. Be willing to turn upside down. Be willing to look at things from all angles. Not again as a demand, not again as a requisite or pre-requisite, but simply as a suggestion to get around all angles. New proceeds. I am also including the visual imagery blocks and mandalas. As you say, it's all one thing. Do you have any new coaching or questions concerning my mission? The only suggestion to facilitate the grounding of the information is to simply remain as grounded as possible about it, which means requesting to be aware of opportunities, being receptive to being aware of opportunities, and an immediate engaging of your activities when an opportunity becomes apparent, acting on opportunity. First again, setting up the reception, allowing for the professment of the permission I wish to attract opportunities, though not at that point the end of the process. That is the beginning of the process. The midpoint again in the process would be the idea that the moment the opportunity presents itself, that timing is very significant, and that that would be the time to, as they say in your society, land with both feet running and do not, it would not be perceived in that situation, that the steps need the effortful and laborious, but simply that the opportunity presents itself behind the recognition of the opportunity is the inspiration, the motivation, to act upon us. Similar to one of his other questions was the perception of the internet and the computer accessing the opportunities available in the computer system of the internet system. Well, we have spoke of this before, the very idea of global interlinking in whatever form it takes, that being one, is one of the most blatant signs that your society is ready to expand the boundaries of its consciousness. That is, beginning to be, shall I say, favorable to the idea of spreading out, of being aware of that much more of itself, individually, society. So, how an individual engages in that structure will be completely up to that individual. The idea of doing so with excitement, once again, and integrity, will yield a beneficial result according to the person's willingness to commit to that idea. So, it is very exciting, but it has been going on, as you say, for quite some time. It is not a new thing. As it becomes new to each individual and their ability to begin to act within that structure and creasing, you will, however, see an exponential increase in the expansion of individual consciousness upon your planet. It is indicative of a threshold of consciousness, a physical reflection of that, very creative, still, again, unagraded. Your technologies will continue to combine themselves, the end product, the result being, the ability to be in touch with anyone, anywhere on the planet, which is, again, a rudimentary introduction to telepathic or telepathic communication. Right, just telepathic, superhighway. Right, but your information, superhighway, is a significant transition toward that idea, and individuals have not placed their timing in this linear timing to miss that, to skip ahead to the telepathic. There is something quite liberating about the willingness to begin to engage through information, as you say, electronically, or however you choose to express your networking. It is a very fascinating thing. Yeah, it's exciting to get more and more of the ability to do visual art and graphics, you know, not to be generated by the computer, but the ability to have. It is really very obvious, perhaps, to all, that the state of your network, what you call your internet, is quite rudimentary at this point. But it is growing exponentially, and you will find abilities arriving very shortly that dwarf what you have so far expressed. It is in its baby steps, as you say. So, do you think we should get that 16-0 by 10, or the 8? Up to you. You are everything. You know what you need to know when you need to know. So, to us, memory is, as you say, superfluous. Understood. So, well, I'm glad you did the next question. Do you have any new ideas about balancing or equalizing our energy motion, and he has three dows, got energy with projection and relaxation, and the male female gignette, dows. Proceed. All right. Did we get the question? I have the answer. And that was the answer, would you, doctor Lowerytwe you? No. The answer was what you would refer to, as a space in-between, delivered directly to him. Oh, okay. All right. Oh. Would you break down the question we decided? I didn't write downatta, in terms of how you recolen a channel. You saying something like that is the literacy and individual flow of energy? True. For what? Give me a question. Before you proceed, we have discussed with him before the idea of being willing to take credit for his own inspiration. And he may understand that in general, perhaps 98% of the time, what he is exploring are his own inspiration. So, you do the math. I remember the question. Oh, what? But I got it, maybe moved now with this one, because I remember the question. Is that when he actually holds the paper to do his ink lot, he says that there is a similar to how in my channeling and drawing, I would feel an energy flow. I don't know if that's exactly what he means, but is there another individual co-creating a specific ink block with it? From time to time, but the result would be so subtle that he would in general not notice the difference. So again, 98% him... Right. Got it. He can simply add broadly as he wish, paint that 98% across his life, stand up a little straighter and truff what he gets. So I have one more question for me. Oh, right. Do proceed. Why me? This is from Andrew. Why not? One other answer, because you would have it no other way. And simply, when you are willing to trust that, you will allow yourself to see why. When you do not allow yourself to trust that, you function as what you refer to in your society as victim. Very simple. You would have it no other way. With that basic assumption, reinterpret your reality. The results of all your realities are truly, truly a response to decisions that you make about who you are in each and every moment. It is up to you and only you to understand that when you contain it all, you always have the choice to choose any of. Anything that you are experiencing is automatically a result of the choices that you have made. Now, not necessarily do you make the conscious choice, I will be miserable. But you do make the choice, I am not succeeding. You do make the choice, I am not achieving. You do make the choice, I do not have the ability. Those are choices that interpretation of yourself is a choice. And we share this because understanding all this as a choice implies the ability to choose a new. If you understand why me because I would have it no other way, you begin to choose the interpretation that supports why you obviously would have it. Obviously would have it no other way. All your physical circumstances, all of you are a result of deciding in each and every moment who you are, trusting in the decision in the interpretation of who you are and then acting as though you trust the decision. And as simple as this may seem as a way to sum up your methodology for creating your own reality, it is nevertheless still accurate. Nothing that is happening to you is not also happening from you, it is all happening from you. Your interpretation of the events, determine your experience of that totality, determine the filter through which you see your reality. Deciding who you are consciously, instead of seeming to allow a set of circumstances to dictate to you who you are, is an inherent ability that you have as a creator, all of you. It is always in every given moment and option to decide who you are despite what you would say contrary to evidence of the opposite. Simply remind yourself that nothing ever happens to you, it happens from you. Simply remind yourself that your circumstances are a reflection of who you are, not the definition of who you are. Very often given we live in a third density time, linear time, I think. In one given moment it excites us to do this, making decisions and set a whole thing of action in play and circumstances and down the line you are not that person and maybe considered a stickleness of changing of one's mind. But that is what I am saying, for me when I allowed myself to at least have an amount of time that I had to explore other options and who I am, intense last year, about a six month time frame. It seems to have played out, it was an interesting thought, and it has been a long time to explore it and move on to something else. You know, a lot of our belief is that, well, you need to choose who you are and what you do for your life, but that isn't the case, I see it. I think more and more it is opening up with people who have to have created a circuit campus in which they must choose something else and to examine life. May I ask you a question? Will you answer that question without hesitation and then allow any implications of your answer to be discussed afterwards? Oh, what? Right now, from your awareness of your reality, from your awareness of what in life you have sampled, what you have enjoyed, what you have not enjoyed, your physical location, your timing, your relationships, in place, what excites you the most? No baggage, simply answer the question. Well, the interacting with people, you know, where the conversation tends to move forward and that's been in place in various ways. Now, now, that is all. But specifically? Specifically. I'm not going to say that. Nothing much has gotten my attention. No, no. When I say answer immediately, and I say, do not ponder implications of your answer. I am asking you for what you generally refer to as a gut level response. So I will ask the question without judging it, without placing any parameters around it, what comes up and then we can look at it. But what truly excites you the most? Some of it is the channel in various forms. Go on. I really don't know why I stopped. Oh, do you desire to continue to stop? No. Oh, that's a start. That have to do with putting out the request for the opportunity. Now, that request can now be more specific. That the opportunity make themselves obvious by the fact that acting on them is energized by the fact that acting on them is effort. Trusting the criteria that the process will reveal itself by also being as exciting as the so-called thing itself. Now, that level of trust is available. It is available as a choice to you all. In general, not as a judgment for that as an observation, you do not allow yourself to go with that choice. So let us assume you have put the first step in place and in simply being willing to define in the moment without parameters that versions of channeling information from yourself or from what you proceed to be other sources, which still reside within yourself, is a valid idea to be excited. And now beginning to say simply, I have played out the degree to where this type of the step and this type of the step and this type of the step are no longer exciting for me to engage in. All the worries are effort. So my request now, my revision of my request for opportunities to act on to begin to once again express the thing that excites me is that the process itself is also exciting. Yes. Specific request. Easier to fill. Which does bring up the conversation we were having the other night. Is that when one is engaging in something that excites them? And the now effect of it, the process of it is to coin the phrase that we were using is schlep. And that does an excite one. One more question. Schlep. I think we were searching for that word when you said, you were a therapist. And laborious and effort. Right. And laborious and effortful. I know it's not a subject to some degree. Well, where what you call the process would become laborious. Would you as an individual be willing to trust that that is your indication to yourself, here is something else that you did not expect to do coming up in perfect timing? Or is that where you then judge yourself to say, well everyone knows at this point of this particular type of project one is supposed to and so on and so on and so on. Right. Rather than looking for another opportunity to produce the same result that is not effortful. That's an effortful. When you begin to invite opportunity, exciting opportunity to act on, the response time of the universe is just a little bit different. The response time of the universe is generally in what you call predatal. Within can be less, can be instantaneous. It is being willing to know you deserve that and being willing to clearly, clearly define your intention to understand, yes, the process exciting as well. If you deserve that, that is something that is completely valid and that is how I choose to express myself so that the word work no longer carries the connotation of laborious effortfulness but carries the connotation of the stuff that I wish to express and do upon this time. And when you get to that point, we will call it home work once again. All right. I think that's it once you have anything else to hang on. Well, it's simple. Suggestion. That's everything that we share is only a suggestion. Light not. All of you be willing to lighten up. Express yourself with the willingness to love yourself. And when you love yourself, you are like when you love yourself, you express things joyously. If you stumble and fall so what? If something happens that you did not intend, how exciting? If something seems to change direction or momentum, what a surprise. All these ideas when judged can yield what you call negative seeming results in your reality. All of these ideas when accepted as the process, as part of the process and not a restriction or an interruption in it will immediately change the results you are getting. Immediate simultaneous to your redefining of who you are, does your reality, completely 100% change. If you're willing to maintain that resolve, you will continue to experience the change. If you are truly only willing to see yourself through older, less than power terms, you will express that as well. But it is your desire, individually, societally, to see yourself in empowered terms. And you have that going for you. That desire is not lost in the whole totality of your consciousness. It is part of your expression in the age of transformation. Your willingness to interpret your reality as neutral and assign a useful meaning, as you may say, basic stuff here folks, can come in very handy in this timeframe. You have all the information you need, and it is merely a matter of being willing to pull out whichever tool, to pull out whichever perspective, will assist you to realign consistently enough that you are being that preferred person and no longer have to constantly realign. A tool may seem that, well, I already know that. Well, that's fine and good. You already know it, but that's the tool that comes up as being useful now. So do not allow your tools, because you've heard them before, to seem stale, use them. They are shiny. They are ready to come out of the bag whenever you require them. And the toolkit is very, very complete. This is one of the reasons that we have not communicated on a regular basis lately. The tools are there, and they do not become rusty. They are immediately always there, clear and shiny. Is that all? I do so. Oh, why? Did you have a good time? I had a good time. Oh, why? Imagine that. No. Not that frequently these days. Ah, is that your interpretation of who you are? Not that I'm the moment. No. Was that even the past? Was that your interpretation of who you are? Let the soon get. Yes. May I simply proceed with this line of question? How did that you feel? What was the emotion generated by that choice? Actually, it's sad that it would not be that way. Oh. In a preference that it would not be. Spy-rolling judgment. Yes, soon. Oh. Making the new decision is as valid as maintaining. Or re-asserting the old decision. And your willingness to trust in this is all it takes. To turn the key once and for all. There is a point at which when you are willing to express your expanded consciousness. And I mean this figuratively because literally it's not where there are loopholes through which you can, shall I say, walk. But there, in again, the figuratively sense is no turning back. And that is the threshold that many of you perceive. Once you are willing to resolve who you are, decide who you are, emanate who you are rather than interpret who you are from your surrounding circumstance. When you do that consistently for but a short time as you create time, there is no turning back. Everything remains too obvious and evident. All paths are clearly enough seeable in front of you. To the point where if it switches direction, that is as clear as well. Believe it or not, ultimately, you will embrace and part of the joy of the road will be the change in direction. Because once you create the point at which you trust everything, that change in direction is the delightful surprise. So even just being able to say yes and get into alignment with what I am saying allows you to feel that sentiment. Now that you have felt it, you can express it anytime you wish by simply and again is your language very apropos. So re-minding yourself according to preference. Thank you. I have done nothing. I thank you for your willingness to shine the mirror and peer and see yourself. Revel in what you like and rise to the occasion of transforming the things that you know you can be, that you would prefer to express. Not running from any idea of who you are but simply being, embracing, expressing and walking toward more of yourself. You need not look at any moment that you are creating as something to escape from. When you always have the choice in that same moment to see what you can walk to or what you can more accurately be right now. Once you remove the notion that you have the ability to make the decisions, you remove effectively speaking. Third dimensionally speaking, your ability to express your power but you do not ever truly completely remove it. For all it takes to express it again is a simple and slight shift in your approach to remind, re-mind, re-align to who you are. On that note I will thank you and simply say your willingness to trust the timing of everything in your life, including interacting with us, will allow you to see the sense in things more clearly. Anything that we share with you we perceive as a gift, an unconditional gift. But part of that gift right now is what you may interpret as periods of silence. It is simply what makes what you call a song or a melody so beautiful and distinctive. Not only the notes but the space and the timing between them. You created it. On that note I will bid you a most fond and loving good day and will assure you in some way, in some form, we will speak again. All right. Good day.
