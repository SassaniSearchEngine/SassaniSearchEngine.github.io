 So right now, say before we continue this interaction, allow me, if you will, to provide a parenthetical title to this interaction. In other words, if you wish you may include this in parentheses, for the law of whom God, and we try to do it. I have been experiencing jealousy for a colleague. Oh, right? Then why do you feel in that sense that you do not contain when you perceive they contain? Well, the jealousy has to do with her job as a post-part. Oh, okay. And it looks like she gets a lot of good news and death of life. Interesting thing that I feel, and also the other things of acknowledging that there's high intelligence. Oh, she doesn't want to try to die. And your question? It's not very exciting experiencing jealousy, and I would like to transform that world. Well, in general, again, jealousy or emptiness does stem from the idea that you see something desirable in someone that you feel you do not contain, and therefore envy their position rather than recognizing that by definition, your ability to see it in them is your indication that you contain it. Therefore, you are that idea. And if you will act as a person who is that idea versus act like the person that that idea is withheld from, your actions will vary, so what will correspond to creation? Does that make sense? Okay. So one of the things I could predict is to act as though I would receive the acknowledgement from the very room. And you will in that sense then be acknowledging yourself as we have said. Whatever relationship you will establish with yourself will be reflected back to you in your own external eyes. May we say in that way that your willingness to not act that way, and in fact act jealous, has been the very, shall we say, actions that have kept from you what you say you desire? Are you willing being that it is that simple to do that? Yes. Oh. Here's a few other little things. I mean to really think about this and keep going. Oh, you have all the time in creation. Great. Thank you. That is very helpful. Thank you. Is that all? We know that this is great. You feel free in that way to continue to share if you so feel desire and we find deep shape. Yes. You. Thank you. Thank you. God, you're sorry. And you. I would thank you for your talk today. Everything that's been going on in me is so important. And thank you for being there to receive it. For if you are not, I would look a bit ridiculous. I have a question that has a few questions in it. Oh, my. I've had a few experiences this week that were a little unusual for me. After my meditation, for example, I think you should have continued in a meditative state for about half a day beyond sitting still. I felt very one point focused. I felt very present. And I feel confused by that. Is this something that I can talk to live this way? I hope to know what hope implies, doubt or despair. Expect you if you will allow it. Yes. And what this is simply a matter of is having allowed yourself within the confines of what you label, meditation, to be centered and simply upon, quote, waiting from your meditation, continue to be centered. It is that simple. And that was a graphic illustration, if you will, that is that simple. And then I heard the word reverence on another day. I heard the word a few times, and then I kept experiencing the state of reverence with everything that I interacted with. Well, that is simply your willingness to appreciate all realities for what it is. All right. These were, they felt like lifted experience. Something I would associate with. It was meditation. Something I wouldn't associate with in being human and living with the usual life. Well, obviously, there is more to it as you have demonstrated. Therefore, you can now broaden your definition of real thought. All right. Now, the other part of the question is I had on the one and the other step for me. Experimented experiences that as you were speaking of before, I also went down. And I didn't thought whether it was because of the expansion of smashing out the experience or whether there's that belief system because I have an expansion of hacking out the distraction. All right. That may be one idea, but simply recognize that when you choose to create a new belief system, anything that now comes in will be if you truly have the new belief fitting within the new belief framework. If for a moment you allow in that sense something to be an indication of you and look at it from the old belief system, you will seem to create evidence of that line. It is simply in that way your willingness to define it as such rather than recognizing that period you have labeled down could be defined in many ways, and the new, for a horrible you will choose to glean positive from it, thereby only getting any positive effect. So therefore, again, if you feel this happens again, simply being willing to recognize, I am receiving this effect because I am defining it in this way, then allow yourself to determine how you are defining it. I now wish to define it in this way. In your society, there does come, shall we say, an emotional point whereby individuals, unable to glean from their external environment, shall we say, the answers they seek, will begin to turn most firmly inward at the exclusion of the external world. This is a very neutral idea that can simply be labeled self-reflection. However, in your society, any neutral label again, whatever you assign it is the effect you get out, you generally label it, depression. Then by giving it that label, experience that effect, if you will simply say, alright, alright, alright, I am turning inward and allow yourself to do so, you will more quickly see the things you are turning inward to notice, and it will transform that much more quickly. Also notice that whenever arising from a self-reflective state, which we will no longer label as, depression, that you are always a new person when you emerge from it, with that much more shall we say, motivation. I experience another depression, exactly, where I associate meaning with the abstracting, pure ability. How I'm saying things? The idea being again, you are experiencing a neutral emotion that you chose very quickly to give an immediate label. If it's this, it must mean that, does not have to, but it can't. Is that also? Yeah, and I have to give you a question. Oh, there's no key to it. In our last interactions, we told you that there are some entities from your sphere who were available to mutation. Yes, we understand. And that I know my own guidance, and when I meditate and channel, I'm not sure whether I should be reaching out for any of them specifically or just open myself up for communication. In that sense, there are notions simply whatever explains you. Be given that way to list what is available and choose what you're excited, even in that instance. But I don't know what the difference is and what is real- If there may be, to be of service, a different new woman, if not, simply accept that that is not one of the important aspects of the interaction. That the information you are getting is all in that sense that is important. Not which aspect you are getting it from, and when it is important, when it is an aspect, that need be in that sense identified there will be no doubt. So therefore, simply again, do what you are already doing in trust. And do you, over there? For sure. Hi. And do you? A couple weeks ago, or I don't know what, I talked to you about philanthropy and was talking about... Beyond words. Beyond words, and... Since then, I've talked to you a few times and two particular times. One, they were both under the stars, I was looking up in the sky and talking to you, and the first time... I saw a shooting star, I knew you were there, and then I saw... Kind of imagine your face, I saw your face, or your... We do. And then immediately after seeing you, I saw an owl, and I saw it wise, and then I heard another name of a friend of yours, or a response thing, and I'm not really sure... What is your closest approximation of that vibration? It seems like it was a life-old friend of yours, and his name was something like a kakakakan, or something like someone to hear me. And what does that allow you to discover? That you have friends, and... You could have told you that. And they come with you sometimes, and... He never says... Or even... we are physical beings, we have bodies, we have spacecraft. In general, our scout craft will consist of three individuals. They then, in a sense, go back to, hopefully, speaking a mother craft that, in that way, can contain hundreds of thousands of individuals, and can be from one to ten miles, and you're like... There are many upon our planet, and being that we are all, all, and pathetically connected, we are all loosely speaking friends. And the individuals within our immediate proximity are those that can be of most service to us, and those that we can be of most service to. Your whole society also exists this way. Simply, we are conscious of it. Is that all? I also wanted to... And you recognize your willingness to validate the communications you get from us will determine your ability to continue to receive those communications. One thing I wanted to question was, why... Does shooting stars happen? In a sense, what you label shooting stars in general, what you label media rights, burning up upon entry to your atmosphere, and not stars at all. Well, I seem to see them, or I use them as symbols of validating communication. Oh, can you hear me? And I guess they happen a lot. They use quite a common cause throughout your soul system, and in fact, can be, shall we say, predicted as being more busy in certain times of your years. Yeah, okay. Anyway, one more thing was, I've heard people talk about Dreamer with the dolphins. I was just... I all I know is that Dreamer speaks through visions, or... The idea is that Dreamer is representative of a style of dolphins, in this particular case, generally located in your New Zealand area of your planet. And those individuals being that your entire cetacean population, dolphins and whales, are also self-reflective, and in that way, similar in consciousness to your human. Then on, shall we say, a certain group that collectively may be loosely labeled Dreamer consciousness, for they are willing to, very literally, swim with individuals in your society through the idea of your sleeping dreamly out of it. From time to time, that particular dolphin is able to channel through individuals in your society, and actually speak in my place. Okay. And we thank you. Over to you. I was sharing the show. How excited? People. I came up from Florida and started the trip yesterday morning in the state, and today it's five o'clock. And the trip went very quickly, because what I did was written for all your tapes. Now, that's not the first time I've ever... Oh, they all know my tapes, but I understand. We do not even have a taste. I'm not even sure what I'm going to share. It made the trip go very quickly. But you understand, again, the mechanism is you created West Time but gone. Okay. And when I arrived, I felt fresh, instead of drained, which is unusual, after 22 hour car rides. Give me a taste. So what you're saying is you don't need any tapes needed to do. You just said you'd crash after 22 hours. The idea of simply being. Then when, allowing yourself, you're excited in any given moment, you will never feel fatigued for the idea of fatigued in general is from resisting your ecstasy. Resisting who you want. When you will begin to flow and be one with your purpose, it is not very time. And while invigorating, it's a matter of fact. So you simply demonstrate that to yourself. But I mean, it is not so much the idea of the tapes, but the ideas which they contain excitingly on many records. That was simply the symbol used in order to tap into it. You could have, if you were willing to validate, simply turn the tape off and have the conversation in your imagination. If you will reflect upon times in your life and others' lives in which you have vividly used your imagination on your car trip, you will notice it in the tape like time. Incredible trip. From our perspective, quite credible. But we understand. There are however many idiosyncrasies in your language, which from time to time, we point out. Since I have not seen you do any of them anymore, it's a new nuance, like we do, and it's a new piece. Again, I am not clicking my key, but the energy that comes through this channel will be representative many ways. And from our perspective, the idea of certain sounds will be more representative of how in actuality the idea was transmitted. That will be more than we the idea of the clicking of the key. Okay. Thirdly. Oh. Many, many, many, folks, you know, talk to that and we will bring the sharp to investigate more on the green and the green. Simple and unconditional agreement from our stream of consciousness to an accent interact through this channel with total agreement again. Unconditional. He does not have to do anything for these communications. We simply trust that any channel we attract will be exactly what they need be when they need be. And even though I represent myself loosely speaking as an individual, the energy coming through is quite a blended energy, mostly consisting of what you were able to be me as a discreet person, but also having a corresponding portion of an individual in my society that would, shall we say, figuratively speaking correspond to a future self of the channel before you. Me, shall we say, blended is more and more comprised of that aspect of his future self, and in that sense I less and less begin to move back to allow that expression. However, again, I am the main conduit for now. So, I mean, prior to ending, the work to supreme into a curse of an important, important, important, important, this was an agreement that was made that he should be posed to be found. The agreement for the assignment of a time period was colloquially speaking made between lives, but there is much connection with this consciousness to our strength for many reasons that will unfold. And you, share it. For sure. It is. The adorable. Hi, Mr. Sire. Hi again. I would like to make a comment and share with you some new information. Establishing one's primary relationship is a fabulous thing and an exciting thing. And I think that the principle stuff one takes when you're doing that is to see and follow the path of personal excitement. Okay. That is the, shall we say, physicalized proof that you truly believe that. What, as you colloquially say, actions speak louder? It even works. Yeah. I start camping with must, but I think it's four or five months and they've been out of the job. Then you have not stopped counting. Thank you very much. And, you know, I've had another, you know, we come from the States or whatever. However, your abundance has been forthcoming, and we define abundance as the ability to do what you need to do. Well, thank you. By one means or another. It's simply manifested when I need it. Now, if you will begin in your presentation to me, to remove the notion that there is some form of abundance, money, which is not forthcoming, then you will truly be unconditionally receiving your abundance. And again, once vibrating as such an individual, if money is the symbol that needs to be there for you to continue to be. It will be. Well, okay. But by not fixating on the money as a symbol, not having total vision that you will only accept your abundance in that way, thereby remaining effectively blind to the many other ways. The universe is supported. However, it does not have money as part of this formula. Simply whatever you need at that time. Right. So now currently I'm looking at the prospect of doing the two jobs that are incredibly exciting. One is working for a new organization called Peace Shield, which promotes new Earth-state technologies. And I'll eat this international and very, very exciting in all of its dimensions. And also I wrote a couple of months ago a rock musical, New Age, very funny, I think, was the gliest. And through the Gistitements Network, I come in touch with a gentleman by Lena Franko, who is an absolutely marvelous composer. And I'm pretty sure that he's working together on his play. Yeah. Beyond this, he is a stage of transformational events on a different scale. And he's going to, he has in the works a wonderful plan to promote a large scale symbolic fourth density encounter between human beings and petitions. Oh, very creative. Yes, we are a ship. Green bells and the dolphins we're going to see, and they'll be bringing bell boys. Oh, man. And it just becomes more and more exciting. And that's the path to the floor, two days, latest update. Well, it seems that you are quite good, and your job in that sense is well-defined. Is that all? That's always him. I do have a question about sedation. Oh, my. I have a question. My understanding is that we, human beings are genetically from the fighting and civilization, by and large. Not really. Not really. You have in that sense the same, shall we say, genetic ancestry, but you are not empirically from there, nor are there. For that is quite a new system, and that was, shall we say, colonized, life did not develop indigenously there. Your roots are not wide enough from the constellation you labeled, neither. I see. So we are both brothers. Brothers and cousins, literally. Of we are. Where are the sedations from? Where do you describe your origins? In that sense. Very creative question. Similar. Similar roots. Similar roots. Veron shall we say, similar representations throughout the multi- Yes. Though you are graced, or blessed, if you will, by being a single world with two aliens, and when you will be willing to recognize that your personal life is a backyard, you will begin by acting on that to attract other consciousness. And you will be able to recognize that your roots are not wide enough to recognize that your roots are not wide enough to recognize that your roots are not wide enough to recognize that your roots are not wide enough to recognize that your roots are not wide enough to recognize that your roots are not wide enough to recognize that your first alien contact is right in the backyard, you will begin by acting on that to attract other consciousness, realizing that you have that happiness. At the S At the S on, you see gray shrch DOWN THE N Together, they areDonaldTrump before this is a coding full swing. When will news, when will the dolphins? First opportunity I get, I create, I mean. Whatever. Thank you very much. Shady. Shady. Figure it out, doesn't it? For sure. I'm curious about where it is you are, her plan. Oh, again, personally right now, I am lying down toward my scalp crack, which is orbiting my planet. The name, although we have no language right now, we do in that way communicate telepathically. We do in our ancient history have a language in SSI. And means place, and SSI means living life. We have in recognition that we are simply prismatic breakdowns of the white light of infinite creation recognize that we are living life, and thus have made our world place of living life. We are in that way within a so long system. Similar to yours, also the third planet from our sun. Though our sun is a greatest yellow star in the therefore, therefore, instead of the approximately 93 million miles you are from your sun, we are approximately 120 million miles from our sun, which we refer to in our ancient language as simply shot. Is there more of a specific question that you see? I'd like to know, how is it that if you were in another country, I mean if you were a champion, someone in Turkey or a plant, would you have a veil or see the language of those people? Oh yes, and understand I do not speak your language, and I am not inhabiting the body of the child. I simply send through, shall we say, technological means, loosely speaking, my intentions which come essentially in chunks of information, which are then, shall we say, translated through the mentality, loosely speaking the memory bank, the language banks of any given channel. Therefore, again, although I have picked up a few words here and there, of your language in general, I do not know. Simply send my intentions and thoughts, and they are represented by whatever channel in various ways. One of the ways will be through the language, another way will be through the gesturing of the hand, a third way will simply be. I mean, I do not know. That whatever language or memory bank or expertise that any particular channel is for program with will be, shall we say, the nuance within that translation box. Therefore, we do channel for instance, the channel is aware of an individual in your Japan, a female by the name of Aya Kao, and because she in that way is. Program with Japanese, that is the language that comes out, and that will always be how it works. Therefore, we need not learn the language. What we have learned is that your radio receivers are very inefficient, and the most efficient, transceiver in creation is biological languages. Although we exist in what may be labeled a slightly different dimensionality, and you in that way would not physically at this time be able to perceive my song, were you to overlay our dimensionality upon yours? You would, roughly speaking, use your Orion constellation as a guide, and we would approximately be in five arms of your light heels in that direction. So that is the question. Yes. And we thank you for asking. I have another question. Oh, we will. The last time I was here, you talked about the universe that our Earth is a very living entity and that it is going to survive no matter what we do to it. Are we? Are we going to? That is up to you. It is our perception that you will build that choose to. From our perspective, it is a given. However, we always allow you your own exploration and discovery of how you will survive. All right. Thank you. And to you. May I? Good evening for sure. And to you? Good day. I've only been here once before to hear you speak, but I was so impressed with the information of our thoughts that you empowered to us. I brought my 13-year-old son here this evening. And I wondered if you had any thoughts for a young man who was just starting in and who was late. Oh. That he might take a little. Do you recognize in your society? Because of the way you create the concept of being ingrained with ideas. As you and that sense age and get older, and find that you do have the option to begin to create your own reality, you create much that you must quote on earth. At a younger age, however, you do not have that quote disadvantage. Therefore, if you will begin now to begin to determine what excites you the most in life and not place, shall we say, in valuations on it. In other words, well, everyone knows you can't do that. You will begin to use what excites you as your guide to do that thing, both again, overall, in any given moment, you will in that sense right now begin to live a joyful life. And as parents, you, beginning to explore this yourself, can also grant that same validity to the child, allow them in that sense to begin to explore what excites them, and allow them to learn most strongly that they can always do something toward what excites them. In other words, validate their excitement and be willing to give them pointers on how they can act on it, but again, the realization of what excites you is only at the job. The other job is to then go and do that thing, and it is that. Is this a system? Yes, thank you. My pleasure. Basically, my intention is that anything we are saying applies to the children, and if they will just learn this to begin with, they will be the teachers. Can I just ask you one other question on your civilization? Do you have schools and businesses and things that are similar to what we have here on Earth? In the way that you mean? No. Our creation of our reality, our civilization is quite spontaneous, because we are telepathically in that way connected, all beings are always connected, and therefore there is a different framework altogether. It is more that although there are physiological mother-fathers that the parents in our society know the parents of all, the children of the children of all, no one is ever out of touch. From the age of three years old, children in our society, although not physically mature, yet have everything they need to begin to live their lives and begin immediately through trust to attract themselves to whoever they need to to learn the things they have chosen to learn and everything works in this way. Because everybody does what excites them and nothing else, everything always gets done in your society that is a tendency to rather than doing what excites you, gardening, you go and take a job to make money. Well then, who does the garden? Some guy who is excited about something else who can only do anything. Everything else is real, but not being one individual is one by one, begins to do what excites them. Amazingly enough, it all gets. Enjoy and love. People are only doing the things they want to do, and therefore are not doing. Alright, a half-assed job. I wish you could wait to love to be sent that thought to every mind on earth. We are. We cannot be responsible for individuals willingness to receive it, but they are on some level. And when and where need be, it becomes conscious. We are in that way non-jusic, yet already being in this district, we are in this district, and we are in this district, and we are in this district. And the fact that these interactions can take place allows you, as well as up to see, that your society has gotten to this point, for we also can only experience the reality we are the vibration of, and you would not attract us. We would not see you unless you contained the positive ability to live your life in this way. We would be invisible to each other. Therefore, we thank you for beginning in your society at the end of your cycle, 25,000 years of limitation, to begin to open up to this idea, and allow us to share the truth. For it enriches us greatly. It allows us to see that many more ways that all men is expressing themselves throughout the multi-class district brings us great joy. And we thank you. It's like there's so much that you're able to bring to us, does there anything that we are able to bring to you? Again, that joy, that is going to be. Also understand that anything you feel I am giving you, is simply your indication of what you already contained, but now you are allowing yourself access to it. I cannot create anything for you. Only you can. Therefore, if you feel like thanking me, thank yourself. You are now re-empower to create your own life. Do not be even. I am very glad to act in this function as a reflection as a mirror, but I do not in that sense feel needed, and I do not feel that you need saving. You are not sure. We'll back to class. Thank you very much. And to you, thank you very much for your willingness to not only open up your own consciousness, but to allow us to stay and get from the children upon your body. How would that happen? Sure. For sure. Yeah. For about a year I studied under an entity that served me as a master teacher. And I did so with the assistance of someone that would ask me questions, and would serve to keep me conscious or awake. In terms to re-contact with this entity, I find that I relax and fall asleep. Oh, you understand that sometimes that is the only one you will allow that type of communication. Simply begin to trust that, and if you have a clear intention of wishing in that way to remain awake, plug in, you will find as you keep doing this you will remain alive. But again, when you, in that way, enter what you label your sleep state, or form or open to communications. And sometimes will only allow certain communications, which may seem a bit overwhelming to your physical self in that state. But there is no less communication when you are falling asleep and in fact more. For it is then able to access more levels of your, shall we say, existence simultaneously. Therefore what I am getting at is do not judge it. If we have the intention, if you wish not to falsely do not, then that will become the reality. But is that a visit? That is a visit I was going to ask for advice on how to do that. Now I understand. Elephant. At the time that I studied with him it was more of a synoptic type of destruction at the table of contents. And it seems that the time has come to delve into the details so that I can bring this into a more practical application. You may in the sense use the following an adage. You were then tuned. Now you can play. Excellent. We think so. One more question. Do you have any advice as to what's the proper medium to express this information through? Oh better. A happy medium. And you understand although we are being universe, we need quite a little. Being willing to grant yourself no any questions. We'll put you in the state of being who you are in any hidden moment and thereby the clearest child. Walk your talk. Are you familiar with the sex scene with the shark? Nay. Sorry darling. Not by that vibration. Out from one line. In a sense we aren't tapping into the overall street. Do we have a shall we say interpretation of the origin of that image? I'm feeling this now. The central sun. Me. Meaning of a place that I refer to as my origin which is not long but a physical plane. Oh. But if you have a specific question regarding this that you cannot already answer. No. Thank you very much. Thank you. That is the truth. I am the answer to be thankful for being bold to take that position. Shame. What's wrong? Yes. I want to say I love you. And you. And you. And you have got time. Love. Really. You have got time. It is my first time also. Every time. I want to thank you and ask me all the things myself that I am opening up to this interview. Well thank you. I am yourself. Is that a question? No. Well thank you very much. For Denish. That although we are opening the question out in exchange we always welcome a bold statement. Which is simply an individual asserting who they are. We find this most designable and action. Sure. We sure. Yes. We are. Are we a liberty to play with time in that we can lead in and out of past, present and future with our consciousness. Specifically if I wanted to go back to a point in my life. If I had a real desire to go back to a point in my life and place my consciousness there would be a way to live from that time forward again. What I am saying is that we have a portion of my life. Can we play with time like that? In that sense if you will believe that it is possible and is part of your explanation. Yes. But allow us now to make a few particular statements about what you've laid in time. Time in that way is a paradise. And some more as you have an illusion, here is why. The only exponential time there is is now. You have always only existed right now. It is always right now. Even right now. The idea being that what you label the future and what you label the past is always being created or recreated from the present. Therefore the present is not a result, exponentially speaking of the past empirically. When individuals define that it is, they act that way and get that reality. But it is not inherent in its choice. Therefore you can recreate being that you create the past from the present anyway any past that you wish. But in general you are choosing to explore this type of reality becoming physical in this way. It is choosing to abide by a seeming continuum. And you in general will not allow yourself to believe strongly enough that you can physically transport back to that time. However again if it is part of your explanation, the way will become attracted to you automatically. Again though, your perception of the past is the only thing that gives it whatever holds it as on your present. So it is not that necessary in that way to physically go back. You can simply be the person you want to be right now. Define what path that person would have had to have and then go back and play out that in your imagination. That will surprise. It will be the path that will support the present you prefer to be. You do this anyway when you think you are getting real memories of the past. For they are always changing as you change the present. You are not the same person you were in that past. They are looking at how you were from how you are in my definition. You are looking at it differently than when it happened. They are for you can say there is no solid path. Just what you define as the past and then assume will affect the present. Does that make sense? Does it make sense? It makes sense. I have a hard time with time. It seems to be a central theme in my life and a lot of things that are time related occur to me. Well, do recognize again that you only do exponentially exist in the now. If you spend each now moment totally validating that now moment which means doing what is right in front of you, you don't have time to think about the past, to think about the future or to think about time. So therefore, very simply stay in your binoculars and be here now and use whatever is right in front of you as the thing that he most conducive to allow you to continue to grow. Does that make sense? Yes, that makes sense. Therefore, you have created time as an issue. You can now create to be in the present time. All right. All right. Is there another question? No. I'm sorry. Sure. Okay. As you knew. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh, I just said we had a day at the street. Oh. You should. I was supposed to say this time. You can pick up. Do you mean to tell me you did something like that? Just to be proud of that. Something you felt you didn't do that didn't you? Yeah, didn't you? Any? Well, I don't know. Even though it was a student saying it was a nice one, it was also very terrible. Oh, in a way, part of the definition of that excitement, but you're wrong. Okay. One of you is based on why. I mean, I was just saying that it was a good affair by letting him know that he was diagnosed there. Again, it can be anxiety versus excitement, negative and positive interpretations. However, we sense it is more the idea of fearing that a reality that you did not prefer was most likely at that moment. No, I cannot be still alone. Therefore, would you create a reality that you do not prefer? And recognizing your feeling that you are believing that you will, and that you can make a conscious choice to choose the other world. Or slow. Good. Thank you. Sure. Bashar. Yes. I had an experience last week, one night. I was lying in bed with my boyfriend and we were talking, and all of a sudden, this darkness of this feeling collected. And I was almost as gravity and taken over felt, inside me. And I don't know what it was, but it made me feel shook me up and really scared me. All that was. Because I didn't know what it was, and it felt really bad, but it felt, and then it just left me, and it just shook me up, like something bad was happening. So, I needed to know the time, and what thing, and I could try and figure out what it meant. I haven't been able to when I was wondering. In your explanations of what it meant, what have you got? My sister and my mother occasionally get what they tell me are bad feelings, where I imagine the kind of thing happens to her. This darkness, and usually we make a note of what time is in something bad. Trust. No comment. The idea of being in will discovered, and then shared. Thank you. Do not need to be very however, this is an instance whereby your discovery is key to what it's called. And in that sense, any preconceptions received by me would not necessarily have any open posture to receive that. And we do not, in that sense, want you to fix it on details which are not in that sense, overall existing importance. Therefore, we will, in that sense, fix it. Do you have no questions? I don't like this thing. Thank you very much. Sherry. Yes. I'm curious about your connection of body pain and the symbol and what it might be needed to. And I have real bad leg pain, and we're not sure if it's back pain, the pain is coming out through the leg, or there's something wrong with the hip pain. And I'm wondering if you have any ideas why this is happening to me, what's the pain in the leg or from the knee down, the leg, and the leg. In general, I am unwilling to move. Are you doing much like you mostly want? We are thinking. I think I do that as a little. And you always start. Our definition of pain. One of them is pain is the friction that is created from the resistance to your exercise, the resistance to being who it is each other's disease. And therefore, we'll always allow you and remind you that you are familiar with that. When you say still you are most static, when you then are unwilling to get up and move you are ex, but doesn't help. Well, I have a willingness to move. I have an excitement and a passion for what I'm doing when you say it. And if there's a happiness, then I don't understand why the pain is coming at its time when I do feel that I have a passion within you. One of the things I'm tapping into is the issue of a consciousness. Is this an issue with you? I don't know what that really means. Do you feel some way that you're a fundus without me? Do you feel like what you are doing? Do you expect to produce a certain end which is not being produced? Maybe I feel I have to be more than what I am now. Possibly. But the idea is regarding support, support, and structure. The environment is busy. And the age, shall we say, feeling of not being supported by the universe, can the aspect about not being willing to support yourself in what you find most exciting? Do you mean any of these apart? Yes, I think maybe there's an ambivalence about supporting myself on the road to existence. So, we'll act maybe on, and when you begin in that way, simply do what it's not actually the most, rather than just looking around at what that is. You will then begin to unfold one thing at a time, the abundance, the abundance to be that person will continue to survive. Thank you. As you do. There will be, but if you always want to, this is your action. Chet. Yes. Yes. All right. It's, the doctor says there's nothing left. It's not there every minute of my waking day. I'm not conscious of it all the time. I was just wondering if you have any input on that. Well, first of all, the doctor says there's nothing left. There should be the road to this. All right. Well, this is, and that will in general again have to do with communication. Your willingness to be who you are. Your willingness to stay boldly whom you are, understanding that any situation you attract yourself in, that will be in all service. When individuals in your society squelch who they are for whatever reason, to say what someone wishes to kill and so forth, they will create a symbol to allow them to be pointed to that end. Is there some communication you are withholding? My only thing to keep in my mind immediately when you said that is, is, is the reference to my employment. I'm not honest in my interactions with my employers. Well, all right. And you understand very often in your society, not God, not all that is, but the form of judgment for not being honest is to polish yourself. Do not have to. Now that you realize it, simply be willing and give a moment to be who you are. You will begin to notice it has an astounding effect on your reality for the things you have with hell for fear of getting a certain reaction. In general, it's never the reaction to get. Does that make sense? It makes sense that I don't feel in this case that I could be completely honest with them with those. Oh. And then you may continue with that sense to create that sense, to represent that. Why in that sense are you creating your reality between a rock and a hard place in that regard? And does such a job by the nature of the fact that you must squelch yourself to even truly explain to you? It actually doesn't explain it. I move it on and away from it, but I think the process of trying to describe how to do that. Maybe suggest one. Do it. The answer. If you lose the job, so be it. At least you can lose a little bit of caution and clear. Oh. Is that another question? Are you here? I'm sorry, I didn't realize you were happening. That's all going on. We have time for one more shit. Shit! For sure. My father is Parkinson's disease, and he seems to be stuck in a downhill through into a cycle. How very often in your society in that you feel locked into your reality, in your way for life, individuals will create a symbol of bettering slowly online, rather than just transforming the needle. In that way, it is an acceptable way to do so in your society. What a question. Is there a way that I can help him acknowledge and experience the positive nature of this creation of his and a possibility of transforming this experience? In that sense, if we dialogue with him, allowing him to answer the question that he is so willing, you will be surprised at the answer. Again, what is bad about this disease is quite obvious and need not be discussed. But, Dad, what has this allowed you to do that you would not have been able to do without it will yield an answer immediately. And then your recognition may simply be enough in that sense to transform the symbol. Or again, you may then see him toward the ambience that we started to share the idea of the locking unlocking. Or you do not have to do it that way. If you believe it is the only way. And in my right, assuming that it is possible when you mention transforming the experience, this is not possible to actually set the body alright? Okay. Again though, according to his willingness to believe that it is possible, not yours. Does partes is that anything specifically to do with a control issue? May. As many manifestations of any symbol as there are, are as many reasons as they are with each one experiencing something slightly different. That is why they are separate people. Do you think it would be beneficial for me to get my father to one of these meetings? What do you mean to this? Thank you. And we thank you. At this time, we wish again to express to you that you are already doing it. You are always connected to all that is. Even if you choose to feel unconnected and act that way and receive that effect, even though you are still connected. You are always a 100% all being. Even if you use 10% even if you use 90% to make it seem as though you are only in C10. You are always a 100% being. Always unconditionally loved by the universe. If you will begin to grant yourself the same respect that all that is has of you, which is that you deserve to exist. That you deserve to have desires fulfilled. That you deserve to have individuals be of service to you and to be of service to other individuals. And that you deserve unconditional love from yourself. You will then be a complete reclamation of all that is. So, rely. Again, even if you choose to continue to not love yourselves, you will be loved by all that is. That is the extent of the love of all that is unconditioned. Therefore, we thank you again for your willingness to interact with our society on an ongoing basis. And for the child, the entitlement of the next interaction will be this is the life. Therefore, we wish you all a most fun and loving life dream and dream life. You are dreaming right now, wake up and live the dream you want and you will receive the effects of that dream. We wish you a most fun and loving, with my love.
