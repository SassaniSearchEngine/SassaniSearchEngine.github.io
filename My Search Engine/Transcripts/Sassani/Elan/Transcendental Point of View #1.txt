 Now say, greetings this evening of your time as you create time, how are you old? Oh, alright. Thank you. Allow me to begin this interaction with the entitlement. Transcendental. Point of view. Allow again me to begin by defining five phases of awareness or consciousness. Number one, existence. And this in a sense you can say is the essence of all that is. It is eternal. Always has existence. Always will exist. And simply is period. Now the first separation from existence being nest allows a reflection of that existence itself and is sometimes turned by us to be knowing nest. However, allow us to expand a bit on the idea of this separation. You as you say are only able to see your physical body with your physical eyes. If in some way you are able to once remove yourself so to speak. Now one way you do this on your planet is what you would label your mirror. And perhaps you can say through some degree or photographs function in much of that way. Allow you to remove your point of view from yourself to look at yourself seemingly from outside. Now understand this self awareness always exists within you. And you have the ability to reflect upon yourself, self reflect be self aware only because you contain the aspect or the trait of being able in that sense to stand outside of yourself so to speak and look quote unquote back to yourself. Now this tells you a few things. First of all it tells you that you are firmly connected to non physicality. You are physical beings and some of your society from time to time will assume that you are only physical beings that you live in physical bodies are the results in that sense of these bodies. And when you quote unquote die you simply cease to exist. In that sense the supposition is that you are mechanical and in that way are the product of electro chemical interactions rather than the intersection of consciousness with physical reality. Now allow us to illuminate as to why this is a contradiction of terms. For if you were in that sense hard wired in such a way you would not have the ability to stand outside of yourself and reflect back to yourself. You would not have the ability to change to adapt to expand to reflect to define yourself to evaluate that definition and then decide if you wish to change in that sense what allows you to do that is your ability to step outside and seemingly view yourself from another point of view. And this ability is your direct evidence of your existence extending into non physical reality. For you are a product of all the realities in that sense or you are creating all the realities that you experience. And though this is a physical reality you are also perhaps you can say primarily in a sense non physical being your consciousness extends beyond and outside physical reality as well as seeming to exist within it. So this particular reflection this particular transcendental point of view is your indication of your connection to your non physical self itself. Are you following along so far? So therefore you may understand when you in that sense are living in a particular area and have no frame of reference you may perhaps think that that is all there is. But when you perhaps using the analogy climb a mountain from that perspective of being outside of the valley you can now see that you existed within the valley but only from the perspective of standing outside of the valley itself and the analogy extends for were you not in some sense to allow some portion of your consciousness to be removed from your planet itself via your spacecraft. You would not truly know beyond the shadow of a doubt that you were on a planet but the moments that you do you may understand that you are. So the removal the stepping outside the stepping back allows you to see from another point of view who and what you are and you always have that ability to reflect on yourself to reflect back to yourself what it is in that sense you desire and what it is in that sense you have created up to this point. So you can always utilize your transcendental point of view for in any given moment though you may define in that moment that this is all there is that these circumstances are my only choices if you will but in your consciousness step back not shall we say immediately act particularly when what you are creating is a attitude of non preferential emotion you can always use your transcendental point of view to do just that take that step back before you act for as we have shared it is the actions themselves that create the physical reality that change and mold your physical life so therefore knowing an idea in and of itself does not create it into your reality it is the actions that you take continuing on from existence to knowingness and again knowingness is standing outside and being able to look back the next three gradations or phases or states of consciousness or awareness we have discussed many times they are belief emotion and thought and the belief emotion and thought package if you will are one of the definitions within physical reality so you will find that as you do begin to extend your senses beyond physical reality as you do entertain the idea of yourself extending into non physical reality you will begin to experience this from the first person point of view when you are in your nighttime sleeping dream you are in a sense still physical in a sense and we have discussed many times that this waking dream and that nighttime dream are but dreams both dreams but differ in their definition differ in their parameters one of the fundamental differences in the two dreams are that your nighttime sleeping dream need not necessarily create belief emotion and thought and while you are in that state very often you will simply operate so to speak from pure knowing that from that particular first separation from existence itself so to some degree you can say to a very high degree in your nighttime sleeping dream you are already experiencing this but you can begin to experience it in this reality first simply by recognizing that this is so and recognizing that again when you do reflect when you are speaking to yourself about yourself you are doing so from that transcendental point of view and that particular place or space of self evaluation is always the place from which you can choose any action that you wish so if you feel that there are particular actions that are simply automatic in your life and continually yield the result you do not prefer simply take a step back and look again at what it is you are about to do how it feels how you think and what again you will actually do with that particular premise then from your transcendental point of view from slightly removed step back oh wow your imagination to create the template the referential preferential you simply your being aware that you can always step back is all it takes to always have that as a choice in any given moment this will allow you now to only proceed in action consciously according to preference rather than in an automatic fashion yielding a result you say you don't prefer and there are many examples in the individuals present this evening who can in this sense attest to this fact so therefore whenever you wish again we never force you to grow too quickly or to have too much fun whenever you wish you can simply take a few steps back look and evaluate where you are at and where it is you wish to be if the actions you are taking are leading you in that direction by all means continue but if not that transcendental point of view is your transcendental point of power for once you have transcended the automatic feature that you define in your reality you have transcended now the tendency to act in a way that you do not prefer again this ability is your indication is your evidence if you wish to your direct connection to your non-physical self when in your sleeping dream you have a thought and the scene simply changes around you without seeming to have gone through the emotions the thoughts and the actions this is what creating from direct knowing that allows and this is what you can actually do in this reality though perhaps your particular timing is such that you will choose for a little while longer to enjoy or to play around in your physical reality with the agreements that you have put into place rather than forsaking them simply owning up to the fact that you have agreed to create this type of reality and therefore now that you know that you can choose to simply assume that this is so and now you get to have shall we say the fun of figuring out how you will create it according to preference now that you know you are creating it it is simply a matter of how you will proceed to create the life to create the reality you say you prefer before we proceed to the interaction to the exchange of information between our respective civilization may we simply acknowledge that in many ways as we have in that sense been saying for quite some time of your time you may understand this year your 1992 which we have labeled the year of the dream is a year that you will find the beginning of the dissemination of information about our existence understand in no uncertain terms this has already begun due to the elaborate nature of the process of suppression the process of letting out the information may to you at first seem a bit slow but there is a cumulative overall effect occurring a bit at a time it is allowing individuals to acclimate it can be it can extend all the way from your television your media your news your special programs but can be as subtle as your t-shirt for understand bit by bit a little at a time there is a momentum and this momentum is perhaps you can say an idea whose time has come you will see many many indications some more in this particular year and next year of your time even more now again we remind you that all any prediction is is the sensing of the energy at present and the rendering of the prediction itself is enough to change the outcome of the prediction depending upon the recipient's willingness to allow it to play out or not but this has been a momentum that has been somewhat stable in the entire time that we have been interacting with your society in this way so though we simply perceive again that anything is possible and you can create your reality in whichever way you wish there is a high degree of likelihood that things will continue in this vein in an accelerated fashion again before we begin to allow me to share one more thing it will always be the choice of all individuals to believe that we exist or not now how is this possible you ask i'll tell you as we have shared again many times there are an infinite number of probable reality therefore you can say literally an infinite number of parallel earth individuals who simply wish not to face that portion of themselves get to have that reality just as well from your perspective from your point of view many people may appear to simply this appear either literally die or simply never to be seen again and you may understand that this is a function of the fact that you all have the free will to decide whether or not you are ready in that sense to open up to more portions of yourself and the reason that we highlight that particular fact is that is the only thing that allows us to interact with you that is in a sense you can say what we are symbolic of portions of yourself that you have not yet been willing or ready to look at again you are everything so you contain it all so our mere ability to interact with you in this way is your indication that at least you as a colonel as a nucleus are in that sense to the point where you wish to interact with us and wish to begin to expose to yourself one by one aspects that you have perhaps been stuffing in a closet perhaps you are now realizing that there is simply nothing nothing that you can possibly learn about yourself nothing that you can possibly learn about yourself that you cannot use in a positive way even if all you learn is that I do not prefer that portion of myself if when you find out you do not prefer a particular portion the secret to allowing yourself to choose something else is very simple and again has been discussed by us many times and that is validating the choice you do not prefer not choosing the choice you do prefer because of how much better it is than the choice you do not your willingness to validate the choices you do not prefer is how you use them in a positive way and then by then equalizing those choices and choosing the choice that you prefer as an equal choice yes that other choice still exists within you where are you going to put it there is nowhere to get rid of it but it has no relativity no relevance to you it is irrelevant so therefore it will seem in that sense to have less weight and only were you able to allow this to happen by validating it paradoxically so therefore again we remind you you can always equalize all your choices by validating the choices you do not prefer and we have as a reference provided that perhaps you can define validation as something having the right and the reason to exist as all things do all things have the right to exist and they explore a particular line of reason and being that God is all that is it is all part of all that is so there are no dark corners lurking within all that is where things hide no and since that by extension means that your choices are a part and parcel of a vibration within all that is itself your act of validating it mimics the validation of all things within all that is by all that is all that is validates everything within it and when you validate things you do not prefer you are acting like all that is you are displaying unconditional love and acceptance this does not mean you need to condone a reality you don't prefer but shall we say by getting as you say in your slang heavy with something you don't prefer you match it you place its engine upon it you keep it suspended right there in your life and that is the mechanism that is how invalidation actually gives more weight rather than less so the simple act of saying all right all right all right obviously I don't prefer this obviously I don't condone however I am now going to establish my transcendental point of view step back can I see in my mind of mind that it serves a reason for someone else well yes obviously therefore I can even find a rational reason why it has the right and reason to exist and you can always do this in any way without condoning it acknowledge it as a reality for someone else this puts it back out there and allows that many more options for both yourself but also everyone therefore allow us to share our particular point of view with you for that is all any of you are anyway when you really get down to it when you strip away in that sense your past your future your physical requirements all you are is a point of view one of the infinite number of points of view one of the infinite number of eyes of creation and you can spell that either way therefore allow us to interact from our points of view to your respective points of view enjoy in love as equals and therefore I asked you now how may we mutually be absurd to each other thank you for your introduction it was perfect for what I was here to talk about and we thank you for burning so brightly my dreams have been extremely I've been remembering them more clearly than ever and more really than ever you are dissolving the line it is simply another point of view no less real than this one and we thank you and I have the question yesterday what could I do to dissolve the line even more where I could you do exactly what you said in the beginning which was let go more of the belief the thought and the emotion as well again you need not deny these things for they are part of the agreement of the fabric of this reality but again to key you back into how to do this do what excites you in any given moment from what's available with integrity and you will find that almost everything that we ever discussed no matter how elaborate no matter how illustrative no matter how helpful always boils down to that one simple thing for when you are doing that thing you are being who you are you are not denying anything about yourself when you make a statement openly to the universe that you are now willing to be who you are all the portions that are representative of who you are not come to the surface so that from your transcendental point of view you can acknowledge them for it is the denial of them and the invalidation of them that has allowed them in that sense to exist in a bottle of passion so by being who you are in action which is the doing of the exciting thing with integrity you are living your dream you are walking in your dream and you will notice physiologically when it begins to serve your purposes for again you are agreeing to interact with other individuals with particular specifics in place to assist each other but you will literally find some of the definitions going back and forth from one dream to another. Do you go see? I do find that and perhaps ask yourself well did that happen or did I dream that and the answer is both. The dream from a couple of nights ago took me to a place called Al-Tara and what I felt when I was getting there was it was a very urgent mission resulting in all of the missions and I had to come up with the message exactly how to get there and follow the direction but the direction only came moment to moment and I had to choose every moment and slip through some sort of gateway to the house one thing. So getting there I was a symbol for these Al-Tara and whatever they call them to that we are accelerating here in this society and this consciousness physically. Very little and also understanding no uncertain terms that you are already aware of this to some degree in your sleeping dream reality for in that particular presentation of your point of view you do display more of your non-physical characteristics. Therefore in that state you very often interact literally with other consciousness other society and in fact you will find that very often individuals from your society particularly of the ilk presence this evening assist and aid and teach and act as guides for other individuals in that state and you are literally being of assistance to what you would consider other consciousness. Therefore in a sense you can say that was a symbol of a literal occurrence a literal arrangement that you have as many of you do in fact on some level all of you for shall we say you do quite a bit of learning by the teaching. And so that was a neat thing to share and I just wanted to share my joy in the interactions with the children on your planet and in what they've taught me about the children on this planet in reflecting off and understand that you can also point out to your children the concepts of excitement the concepts of integrity we suggest when pointing out the concepts of excitement to what you label children that you highlight in no uncertain terms excitement from what's available in the moment that is what will enable them to begin to gather up from their transcendental point of view the choices and only always pick the one with their integrity that excites them then they will not as you sometimes say you do this is not literally true anyway but we understand they will not then later need to unlearn your shall we say ecstatic explosion of obligation not yours personal is that a lot of us then do thank you. I have been experiencing a period of a celebrated growth. And I'm hoping that you can talk about it a little bit I have been experiencing new streams of energy in my body especially coming into my throat and screaming down the leg. It is simply very simple a product of the fact that you have removed the resistance you are now beginning to flow with who you are when you do what excites you you are being who you are when you see that something within your integrity excites you and you do something else you are resisting who you are to whatever degree you are willing to apply this what you are speaking of is the result the literal result the beginning or perhaps you can say the initiation of the ecstatic explosion of continual coincidence and synchronicity bringing you everything you say you desire. Yes I mean I've also at the same time been experiencing acceleration of my psychic sight. That is by the way part and parcel again of going with your flow for again psychic ability requires in that sense unconditional empathy and if you are resisting who you are you are not that likely to allow other people to be who they are when you allow them to be who they are and establish an empathic synchronization this is what allows us to occur and you will again all find to some degree an increase in that type of vibrational discernment which is again a sense much as your five senses are and this will be one of the many all right perks you can expect. Can you talk a little bit about the vision that I've been having when I work with Emily and also when I look in the mirror at myself. I see it seems as though I go into another sense of almost a dimension of color and my hearing changes. Vibration of the moon changes I will see what I look at this person I have seen her take on many different forms I see myself take on many different forms we understand when I look in the mirror and look into my left eye I go to a whole visionary experience of me changing forms it's almost like I'm being communicated with by myself. Thanks and we thank you for providing a concrete if you will example of shifting your point of view to a transcendental point of view for this is all in that sense that you are doing once you assume that transcendental point of view there are a myriad of ways that you can experience it and that is one but it is that ability to remove yourself so to speak that allows you to feel that and now that you are shall we say exercising those muscles you will find it to be easier and easier. Is it assisting you and in what way are you able to use the information in your life that you get? I it's assisting me because I feel firmly connected to my story and I feel the sense of what the possible is and I feel more expansive and I feel more joy. And allow me to simply say to you congratulations you are living your dreams right now it will always be up to you from this moment forward to continue to be this you and should you find at some point there is a portion of your consciousness as you still create portions less and less that says I'm back climbing this is the old me step back assume that transcendental point of view and simply remind yourself that the old you had none of this information so therefore it cannot be literally the old you but it is showing you that you are so powerful that you can even with that knowledge temporarily assume that point of view once more nothing is lost and you will always have that as an option. Thank you. Nice to be with you this evening. Pleasure to sense you as well. I've been introduced to a young lady. Hey, so I. Uh, close to my home. We'll say the community is East Providence. Her name is Terry Cabral. She has sent three sigh units of a triangular craft. Good number. Would you like to sense to be as a sign? Hey. The most recent one was in April of this year. Oh. And I call her a very amazing sign. Only because not only was it as a sign but it was as close as 15 feet to her. As we can rewrite that. She saw this ship on two other occasions. Of course her first reaction was complete fright. And by the way, this was due to the proximity itself. The physical proximity. New proceeds. I've been working with her to help her. I just wanted to know if there is a significance to this. Absolutely not. Next sharing? Only kidding. It's really... How can I help her? Simply in whatever way you find is most natural for you to do so. Again understanding that you need not convince her of anything. Simply share what it is that you feel would be appropriate for her. Allow her to make her own decisions. And she will. Or understand from our perspective. The presentation of our craft in that way was to provide a catalyst. Was to provide a trigger as often are the cases with presentations of this type. To allow that individual to begin to look in no uncertain terms. At many of the ways that she has chosen to define herself. Many of the ways that she has chosen to define her reality, her world. And many of the surprises that lurk both within and without her. Therefore is there something specific you are seeking? I want to know if she also has free agreement. Hey. I thought so. Now understand again that we are particularly non-abnoches. From your perspective. So therefore it will always be up to her. Never will we break the door down. Perhaps we will ring the bell. Perhaps we will even knock from time to time. But always will it be her choice. Do open the door. Or say nobody's home. Thank you. I have one other question. Some time ago, as you might remember, my son Clifford and a friend of his had a private session with you. Hey. And his friend was very interested in the possibility of channel. And what does friend wait for? His friend is not. In fact, his friend is doing some channeling. Hey. And it's coming along fine, but there is a little bit of a problem. Oh, right. It is that there are other entities that intercede at different times. Not really. Maybe you can help us in a way. Hey. Understand, very often when individuals begin to open up to many energies, to new ideas, to particular agreements and connections that they have. Because the consciousness that they communicate with, particularly in this instance, is more expanded, not by way of a judgment, simply an observation in terms of point of view. The initial interpretation into your more focused reality can be as more than one being. But that is the multi-dimensional nature of the expanded version that the consciousness is. Is this translated? Yes. So we can see, like in that sense, many individuals, and we'll generally in these instances, though not always, coagulate to one particular point of view. Now, if mixed in with these presentations, there are ones that are non-preferential. They are, shall we say, herself, or aspects thereof. Her doubts, her fears, her hesitations. Prosy. Thank you. That was really helpful. I have one other question. I'm also a hypotherapist that I'm working with two people that have been having some problems because of the, well, the pain that we call them, that some of our friends. And could you give me some information on the entity extraterrestrial entity that I would describe this impact? And has the facial features of a praying message? Very often, this will simply be the interpretation from a particular frame of reference of reticulum beings themselves. And, due to the, shall we say, presentation of the eye, and the particular, shall we say, shape of the head, there is often that particular filing of identification. But it is our perspective in the instance that you are speaking of that it is direct reticulum. Also understand, there are several, shall we say, races or body types of that civilization, including some interaction, tangentially, which we will not discuss in detail, which would make the presentation of other seeming body types. So the ones that are quote unquote more alien looking are the ones more prone to be identified or compared to insects. If an individual interacts with the more human looking ones, then this may not be the case. Is this clear? Yes, it is. Thank you very much. And for rewishing that sense to clear up, there is a misconception. One of the ones that we are aware of through the channel is that there are insect-like beings from the constellation of Orion invading Earth. And from our perspective, this is simply a misidentification. And assumptions made based on fear. Is there something else? Not right now. Oh, thank you. Shut up. Hey, I'm Ryan. Hey, thank you. And to break that spell, mind. Oh, it's lost in anxiety. Oh, do you know what anxiety is? Anxiety. Hey, with a negative interpretation. Yes, I know. So assume your transcendental point of view and ask? Well, you know, on that subject, I think it's because I just have so much to share and so many questions. Well, how exciting. You know, I go, of course, I can't write them all down and I don't have the time. Oh, you say so? Well, you create the time, so perhaps you are creating not to have it yet. Well, then let me say this past month has been really exciting for me. Oh, and I'll just sit with that. Let me just... Now I have the time, I can't speak. You're doing just fine, though perhaps you may wish to make a verbal communication as well. Well, I've been talking about this, I call it, I'm calling it disappearing act, you know, where people just vanish. Well, again, we simply mean that you will perhaps lose track of them, not that they will literally vanish. And again, sometimes this can be traced rationally, as you say, to a seemingly physiological death of the individual, and their perception is that they never died and simply continue on on an earth as though nothing has changed from their point of view. But again, it may simply be that you simply no longer are in contact or cannot locate certain individuals. That literally. So it could be my own fear of losing these individuals. Put it this way. Most of the individuals that you interact with out of love, out of similar vibration will be on the same earth as you. Okay. Yeah, I just, I get into these realities where I'm just, I can be sitting in my car and parking lot. These persons will leave. And it's kind of like I'll turn around, I'll be a whole mother, I'm going to hold my other dream. Well, it happens every given moment. But you assign the continuity. So you may continue to assign it if you're more comfortable that way. Well, the first person who talked to me, she was talking about this fine line, I think this mentions. I feel like I'm really there because moving on, in my dreams, I've been, I've had these incredible dreams. You know, we're, the same thing where I'm not quite sure if I dreamt it in my sleeping reality or now. And, you know, this is my lucky reality. And I had, I just, it's almost shocking sometimes. Although, I'll try to be more specific. I did the tape at home alone. And I had an incredible experience. Now, I, I really felt like when I had gone to the ship, I had, you know, I won't go into, to the experience because I knew it was taking too long. But, but I was laughing with joy, laughing with tears. Then you were there? Yeah, I was definitely there. And, and I guess my question is, there were many experiences I had there. But one of them was that I entered a chamber room or our space where I had seen my mother who has passed away. And I've seen other people that I know that are dead according to this reality. And they were kind of like a whole on a shelf. And I'm not quite sure what that means. My mother was sitting up on a shelf. But what does that mean to you? Well, I don't know. Well, perhaps you have shelled her to the next life. That's interesting. So maybe, I kind of felt like I had just, was getting in touch with some people who, who were dead. But, you know, I'm not sure. In a sense, you may understand that there are particular areas aboard our ship. That are conducively constructed in such a way where individuals can have what you might consider to be a more physical representation of the experience of, in that sense, communicating with other individuals who are in the afterlife for one reason or another, not having yet chosen to reincarnate. So you were simply in one of those particular areas. I had a large experience with, who I'm calling, Ealy, who is another entity that I've had the name for. And you've mentioned that I've been in communication with another. And I'm taking it that it is him. It's a, you know, male. And I had these other dreams later on throughout that week where I had been led into this like funnel or vortex of fluid. And it was some really moving. I had, it was a color funnel of fluid. And he was leading me through this fluid into, I think, another dimension. It was clear to me is another dimension. And I'm not sure what to make of that. So, have we shared with you the definition in our ancient language of the word, Ealy? So therefore you can understand to be another point of view of your own self, a future self. Therefore you are following, shall we say, the correct way? So this fluid, this tunnel, this funnel of fluid, I'm not clear about that, except just passing through from one to the other. It is simply a representation of, perhaps you can say, your recognition of the breakdown from the white light of infinite creation to as many components. And reacting, interacting, and viewing these components in that way. Okay. Did that translate? Yes. I kind of thought that, but I was looking for something deeper. Well, create something deeper? Yeah. It was very powerful. Very powerful. Now, I assume that there is something else that you feel is relevant about this. And perhaps one of the reasons for the hesitation to go much deeper is to simply, rather than reflect to you what you already know so that you can validate it through me. I simply ask you now, what do you think it was all about? I get it. So tell me. For me, I'm really passing. I'm going somewhere. Oh. Why do it wrong? Why the lights? Why the tunnel? There are symbols of the transition from the angles. Oh. In what way? What is the symbol of the fluid itself? Emotion. Emotion of the fluid. Perhaps again, your ability to not necessarily need be in a consistent stake. You are, in that sense, fluid. You do move. You do flow. What about the color? Now we're playing the game. Have some fun. I'm sorry. If you are not going and are instead going, oh, you are not playing. I've been very excited about this. To this point, I'm sitting here now and I'm really confused about it. Well, it's more than that. Re-evaluating. Putting your pieces together. When it comes to you as a flash, please share with us again. I see. Because all this is going on in my head. The next dream I had about, I actually saw my hand in a dream. They were web-like and very fuzzy and confused. Many days later, I swam in a pool. I saw my hand underwater. They were identical. You know, I was really moved by this. I think, what is this? This is just another reality. I'm really seeing. Well, in a sense, it is representative of your interests and connections with your, shall we say, brothers and sisters of the sea. Well, that makes a lot of sense. So therefore, you are now seeing, in a sense, a representation of yourself in a form whereby you feel it is more conducive to interact with them, but that is not necessary. So patience. Cause that jump right in. Dive right in. I suppose it's like I have to. Fort now. I know. Well, I did get just back from Florida and I went there to swim with dolphins. And did not do to your own sense of discernment. Therefore, congratulations. You will attract and you will find the set of circumstances whereby you can do what you wish to do with the feeling that it is within your own excitement and your own integrity. And we applaud your willingness to act and not do something which was not representative of who you were in those circumstances. Well, I'd like to ask, I was swimming in the ocean and how close did I get? Is that possible? Do I answer? Yeah, but may I ask you, what was your frame of mind? Were you inviting? Fear. Yeah. No, you will not attract them with fear. I know. Accent you shocked. Yeah. But in that sense. That's what happened. And it's- But you need not act as though you are a solid lump of mass. You are fluid. You need not sit there and simply be in fear floating along, bobbing along. No. Use the fear. Why am I fearing? What do I believe in this situation, not now looking back hypothetically, in this situation, what do I believe? Ah, I believe such and such and such. Oh, very interesting. Will that attract the dolphins? No way. Therefore, and you continue from the transcendental point of view to dialogue with yourself in this way. It is your connection to your non-physical self. It is always available and you automatically assume it from time to time anyway. So therefore, these were steps that are in that sense you are taking that are leading you to where you want to go. Well, I just like to say at that time, I knew I had fear. I was under the water and I was acknowledging to myself, I have fear. Oh. Nobody's going to come to me with this fear. When we speak about acknowledging your fear, we do not speak about simply saying, well, I am frightened and then going on your merry way. We then again remind you to use the fear. Emotion, result of a belief. That particular emotion is espousing a particular belief in something that you wish not to occur. So why would you believe that? And from this point forward, whenever you feel the fear, yes, by all means, feel it. But while you are feeling it, you can learn anything. For the belief that leads to the emotions, then lead to the thoughts. And the thoughts are a response to those emotions. So by allowing yourself to feel the fear, you will be able to trace back the beliefs. When you hypothetically now speak about the fear, but are feeling joy, you are not likely to create the thoughts that you would create from the fear. Therefore, now perhaps it is not that obvious what you must have believed then. So from this point forward, sees as you sometimes say the moment. And trust not only what you are feeling, but when you are feeling it. That the time you are feeling it is the perfect time to transform it. That is why it's there. That is why it is presenting itself to you. Not because it is extraneous, not to tease you. No. What will you do next time? I will confront my fear. Must definitely. And once you confront it, use it. Glee. What must I believe in this circumstance? Look at the beliefs. Drum up the new preferred belief. Feel that. Go back and forth if you wish to weigh them. But you will perhaps notice that the new preferred belief has a more preferred emotion. That preferred emotion leads to preferential thoughts, thereby laying down the blueprints for preferential action. This is what will attract them. Also again, the spirit of fun, the spirit of play, the spirit of fascination, of exploration, attracts them as well. And when you swim in direct proximity to them, you will feel this and you will tell me. Yeah. I've been with them a lot, but I haven't swim. I don't know what that's about. But you can invite them to swim in the sea of your nighttime dream anytime. All the time now. It's frustrating. All right. In what way? Well, I'm not going to let you get away with that. I just am yearning for this experience. Okay. Frustration. I'm okay with it. The frustration in any time that you are feeling it means that when you are looking at what's available and choosing from them, you are adding things that are not available. If you push those aside simply before they are not accessible, you can then reground yourself to what is there. And one of those choices will be more exciting than the rest. Then you are not frustrated. You are simply acting and being. Okay. We thank you. Thank you. Hey, it's been a. It's really great to be here. It's really great to be there as well. I want to ask you if you can shed any light for me on a relationship that's coming to my life. And it's kind of a very different feeling. I think to believe that this connection, like I found an old relative from many centuries ago, and I'd like you to tell me if there's anything you can say about that. Frustration. Prone. Hold to this person. Interestingly enough. In this particular instance, we are inclined to suggest that the connections that you were seeing, the connections that you established, are the connections that you have here, now, in this life. What is most important about the symbol and the message of what you are sharing is what is to occur, not what has in that sense. And if you will simply stay grounded in where and how it is, then some of these past ideas will come up in perfect timing. But right now, the presentation of them to you would be a distraction rather than allowing you to live in that way. So perhaps not what you wish to have heard. But from our perspective, this is what will be of most assistance to you in this instance. Would you like another question? Yes. We're talking, a lot of people talking about your names and sleep. I guess I'd like to ask you, I have some kind of fear about going to sleep because when I dream, it seems like I'm in war and I wake up exhausted. I'm obviously afraid of a lot of things, but is there a practical something I could be doing before I go to sleep to kind of work through the fear or acknowledge it? Well, again, feel it. Establish what you believe. But perhaps the most helpful thing that we can in that sense suggest would be to assume your transcendental point of view and make the decision that no matter what is chasing you, you will turn around and face it. No matter what the form of the particular conflict is, that you will simply extend your hand and make peace. What you are in that sense experiencing is, again, the notion within you that there are portions within you that perhaps you fear to look at. But again, we remind you that there is nothing within you that you cannot use in a positive way to allow yourself to continually be the person you prefer. Is there something obvious that comes up when this is shared? Do you think about the fear? I don't know. About the particular scenario you are describing as warm-like. Oh, well, I'm going to know the divorce, so there's a lot of... I have battles about what my heart wants to do and what my lawyer wants to do. Well, again, it's always up to you from that transcendental point of view to choose either. And we assume that you mean by your heart's point of view. The point of view you feel is most representative of who you are. Therefore, it would always be our particular approach to follow that and trust that whatever the outcome you know what you're doing. And again, this is extending. Perhaps you can say you are extending it into many aspects of your consciousness. But when you make peace in that sense with yourself and then reflect that inner peace by being willing to embody outer peace, then you will no longer have an underlying representation of conflict. Perhaps the shortest answer is ultimately following your heart will achieve this. But that is up to you. We have no lawyers. Great. Nor would we judge if we did. Okay. One more question. I don't know if you can answer this one about a type of yoga, which this person has introduced to me in his personal relationship. Oh, this one? I'm not sure, but it's called the Haja Yoga. And the claim is that it's a very powerful, practical way of, I guess, being in that who you are stated all time, the way to help you focus. Well, how helpful can you in that sense describe the process? It's meditation with chakras and energy. I'm just starting it, but it doesn't seem too different from any other kind of meditation or being here and vibrating where you are. But there seems to be some fear that they seem to project about you need to do it this particular way or it won't work. And I have trouble with that. Well, we always suggest allowing your imagination to cater anything to you and to trust that. So our perspective would differ from that. But again, all of these ideas collectively are simply tools. And when they work for you, use them. If they no longer work for you, acknowledge them having any role in aiding and assisting you and then allow yourself to attract whatever new tool in that sense will now represent who you are. But it is up to you. One thing we will share from our point of view. It is not the only way. It is one way. If it excites you, go right ahead. That indication tells you that that will allow you to accelerate most quickly into the frame of mind you are saying you wish to be. But if it does not excite you, trust that as well. Trust what does excite you. And without invalidating any gift offered by another individual, you can simply say, well, thank you very much. I already have a gift. No, thank you, but thank you. Here is my gift and share what does excite you with them. This way you are each offering what it is you have to offer. Believing in the power of what you have to offer as to not then convince them and giving the ultimate gift of living by example. Now, are you excited about this process? It is very peaceful. So in that way, it helps me to find some peace. Now, understand that you will create whatever changes occur in your life. Many times individuals will only validate those changes or allow themselves to believe if they believe they need to, that they earned those changes with the creation of elaborate set of steps or process so that they could actually have earned it. And that is a valid way. That is a valid way in that sense to allow yourself to transform, supplying yourself with the symbols that enable that allowance. But you can simply again, always in any now moment, since that is the only experiential moment and each now moment is a complete package, simply decide to be that person. In the moment that you conjure it up, in the moment that you decide it, you are that person. Then it is simply a matter of how you will then choose to proceed. Will you now in the next moment choose to be the old person again, so to speak? Or will you trust that you have changed and apply that trust as actions that are consistent with the new youth? Perhaps you will remind yourself from time to time that you are already the new you. So therefore, this old approach no longer applies to the new me. Now let me through my imagination, supply an alternative from the new me. And then your processing will be automatic. For imperfect timing, your negative emotions will come up. If there are underlying beliefs there, you will trace them back. And one by one with no effort, imperfect timing with the flow, in the flow automatically, create and integrate and transform all these pieces that you seemingly create. So it is completely up to you. But it is a valid tool. Thank you. Adriene. Hello. Hi. Hi. Hi. From a transatlantic. By what? Greeting. Greeting. From a transatlantic point of view, when you look at Bishar, are you looking at yourself, are you looking at one of us? What do you look there? What to see all that is? Do you see all of us? What do you see? Can differ and it will depend again upon my particular focus. I could physically, or I to be in proximity to you, perceive you with my eyes as a physical being. So with other members of my own society, we can perceive each other utilizing the senses in much the way you do. But we can also in that sense, stand back and perceive aspects of each other that you may say do extend into non-physicality. Particularly now that we are at the end of our fourth density, the end of our physical experience, and beginning to transition into our non-physical experience. We now in that sense are able to connect more readily with the non-physical portion of each individual. So again, it will simply depend on the purposes for the interaction and what it is we wish to observe. However, there is always an underlying acknowledgement and appreciation that anything that we are viewing from our point of view is simply another aspect or expression of ourselves and all that is. So there is this underlying understanding. Perhaps you can say we take that for granted and how we physically perceive each other will vary depending upon the purposes for the interaction. Did that answer the question? Some were. Oh, it's not please in that sense request clarification and very clearly do so. When you breathe, how do you breathe? Similar to yourself. No, with mathematics breathing. Do you like breathe in, hold it, and then breathe out, hold it? What you would perceive if we again are understanding the question is we breathe much as yourself. In that sense, when not quote unquote paying attention to it, it is quite automatic and will vary perhaps sometimes the less. According to our activity and so forth, again, similar to yourself. But when in that sense, we wish to access particular frames of mind even in this point in our particular development. Yes, we will consciously alter and consciously unites our breath somewhat similarly, though a bit different, to how you perceive the rest vibration of the channel alters when we in a sense link up with him. But we will do what you might sometimes consider or call in your planet, yogic style breathing to achieve a particular state of mind. That is one way. Just simply again, very deep, rhythmic full breath, drinking in all of reality, relishing it for a moment and simply then letting out the portions which are not in that sense. Representative of who we are and you can perhaps say maintaining the portions at all. Did that translate? Yes, thank you. Oh. Sh Pina. Yes, come on. Hello. Greetings. And who is it? You. Or upon my plan, it is day. Good day. He had said that when my mother asked for this reality for next reality that you would be there to assist her. And I was wondering if she had an easy transfer. Now, I understand that our particular assistance is what you may label peripheral. And gents. We do not in this sense appear in the form that we are in for that perhaps you can say would frighten many individuals. Do you want to blizzard anything there? Yes. And perhaps in a sense more in the form of an old friend. Tell me. Or can you tell me the love and life that I have been sending in the perhaps prayers of the... Absolutely received, but shall we say by more than just one? Thank you. So she is aware of the... To some degree. That particular aspect of the rendering of your unconditional love serves as an anchor to some degree. However, there is a new orientation you can say that takes place. And she is in the midst of that. I see. So you may find there are times where you simply do not sense her presence. This is because the flow of time in that reality differs from your own. And whereby, but moments may seem to pass in her perception of time when not synchronized to your perception of time. This may translate as days, weeks, months or sometimes even years to you. So just as I'm learning here, she's learning that. Oh, you never, never, never did he say never? I think so. Thank you. Never cease to grow. Never cease to expand. It is, perhaps you can say one of the paradoxes of reality. Four, you already contain it all. And yet you never cease to grow and expand. These two concepts seem mutually exclusive. They are not. From a physical point of view or perspective, maybe they appear that way. From a transcendental point of view, when you begin to perceive paradox, you are firmly connected to the non-physical portion of yourself. For only there is there the allowance of the existence of all things, even things which seem contradictory or paradoxically. So at some point in my time of faith here, will she be able to come to me? But it is not her job in that sense to do so. So what it will generally be perceived as from you is a simple nudge. And not to nudge that you should do this or you should do that. Perhaps one way you can put it is that she gently assists you, lures you to more of yourself. So it will always again be your option to act upon it or not. But no one does anything for you, not even from that end. And to you. Hi. I would like to know why two people are in my life or have been in my life. For four and a half years I can buy a few negative situations. Oh. Are you sure you want to know? Oh. And will it dishearten you that it is very simple? Every question? Because I have advanced all that I know is a procreation. So I... Oh, it is very simple. That has been the time that you have been willing, perhaps not knowing that there was any other possibility, to continually settle for less than you see of yourself to be. And as significant is the timing right now that you have finally decided no more. I will not settle for less than I am and now all the symbols in my life that have been in place that represent my willingness to settle for less are fallen by the wayside, so to speak. Very simple. You want to do anything symbolic and there being one last eruption from the land of people? I mean, I... There are several ideas that are relevant. But what we see as being relevant to point out is your unwillingness to match his vibration. Your willingness to maintain as a reflection and alternative to his point of view. And to learn what you also do whatever degree you are willing to get. For you show them no matter how you are acting, I do not act that way. Here is how I act. See an example of this way to be. I see an example of how you are. But if I retaliate, I am matching who you are. And I am showing you that it is okay to be the way that you are. See here is... here I am. I am that way too. I just couldn't understand why they were in my life. Well, perhaps you cannot understand immediately, initially, why you have been willing to settle for less. And again, it can simply be a matter of not necessarily believing 100% that you had the choice. And creating the symbols in your life to force yourself to see that you have the choice. I also... Does this fit? Yeah. Oh, you sound a bit unsatisfied. And it is not our desire that our communications have that effect. But when you look at much of what we are discussing, it is in a sense representative of what you are asking. And I will have to listen to it again. And we applaud you for your willingness to now only be willing to represent by, at least validating to any degree your excitement, your integrity. That willingness to take the actions that are consistent with that, we applaud. Can you tell me what happens to the $215 because it's here? No. Can you say that? Then what is the lesson for me? Please. For joining, if you really want a lesson. Please. Tell me. Now, perhaps you are analyzing a bit too much. The obvious. What is the most obvious thing that that particular incident allowed you to see about yourself? Well, the interesting thing is... Well, there is an interesting thing. Or what? We are getting someone. When I talked about it, I said, I am really upset. But I really wasn't upset at all. It was like it was never there in the first place. But I know it was live. Oh. And that is only one. What else? I like to follow up. Oh. Then simply utilizing that one example. How do you feel but a few months or years ago you would have reacted in a similar situation? I was embarrassed. Oh. So now that you have a place to start and looking at how it serves you, anytime you feel the urge to view that symbol again, trust the timing of it and then go a step further. But by asking us and us telling you, this does not empower you to take, shall we say, the action of the gleaming by yourself. And this is our desire. Though we revel in interacting and sharing with you, and we'll continue to do so to whatever degree you are willing, we in a sense wish to begin to take a little bit of a step back and allow you to do, you to evaluate, you to make choices and decisions so that if we are busy gallivanting about the universe, you can still live your life. OK. So, you know, when I got from that is that I'm not reacting to the thing I lose, reacted a year ago. And therefore you did not lose anything. You have yourself. And nothing can ultimately be lost. Perhaps it can. And this place itself. This is unclear. Two more little questions. I've been getting from a lot of the better description thing. If you have visual effects from about what the animals do. OK. Literally. And simply, when you find any situation in your life, whereby you have a communication to make, make it deliberate. Do not let anything as you sometimes say bottle up. Your willingness to be that open, to trust that who you are is whatever you interact with needs to see, needs in that sense, and has attracted to themselves to explore, then you will notice the cessation of the inner pressure. My confidence in getting quite violent, especially. It is directly related to that as well. So simply, now that you are not willing to settle for less than who you are, who you define yourself to be. Your true self. Tell people about it. Do not withhold communication. Trust that your communications are a gift. Both of those symbols will then transform. I'm entering the Christmas on Monday. Or? Or, can we maybe say something at work? We might have the time. Or, pleasant dream. Or you will be very busy in your nighttime dream reality. Thank you. At this time, it is only a break. Allow us to fall for a short break. And resume contact in 10-15 minutes of your counting.
