 All right, I'll say continue shedding. Yes, I am. And do you? Good day. I have been assigned to sent greetings from the sources and navigators. Well, all right, thank you very much. And may we extend our greetings to her as well. And thank, in that sense, that individual for her willingness to proceed with peace of mind. Yes, and I'd like to take the opportunity to point out that it requires a result in this spot. So if it's one who's been taking responsibility for this spot, it's fine. Well, all right, and we thank you as well. One of the ideas that we had communicated to your society, although you can feel free to use it as your own, does not need to be as you say, build as coming from us, is an idea called the Peace Clock. The idea behind this particular notion is that at every day, at what you label, noon time, for one minute, each and every one of you who is so inclined, meditate on world peace. What this does is many things. It synchronizes individuals within a particular time zone. With unity in purpose, this gives a great deal of momentum behind the notion of peace on your planet. But what also happens, given that you have upon your planet, differing time zones, is it creates a wave of energy that encircles the planet each and every day as each time zone clicks over to noon of peace and love on Earth. Therefore, this can be very conducive toward, shall we say, encoding the mass consciousness with the ideas of peace. And since many individuals seem to desire this, this is but one simple methodology that you can utilize. So feel free, please feel free to do so at any time. And we thank you as well. Is that all? No, just to say my own personal love to you. And to you as well. Shady. You're sure? You value. You talked about every civilization having a figure very much like our Jesus. Can you give us a name for the figure that was represented that way on your planet? Yes. And again, to understand, we have no language per se. We are tell a pathic beings or more precisely tell empathic beings. However, in our history, we did have a language and from time to time, we are able in that way to convey it through particular channels. The translation, or shall I say the closest translation to the name of that individual representational symbol upon our planet was Shikana. The idea is we prior to the coming, if you will, of Shikana were never quite as focused in limitation as your planet was. That was not the purposes of our particular exploration of physicality as it is yours. Therefore, the manifestation upon our planet of the Christ spirit only took the form of an embodiment for but three days. During that three days, quite literally the entire planet fell asleep. And at the end of the three days, we again quite literally woke up into a collective daydream. And therefore, when that energy did come upon our planet, we listened. Is that all? Yes, thank you. As you. Shik, over there, now. Sure. As you did. Sure, I thought I had a problem with one of your points. Thought you had a problem, all right? At that point, as you are creating your preferred reality, ignore any evidence, quote, evidence to contrary. Not ignore it as much as do not accept it as evidence. Look at the other reasons that you have, shall we say, manifested that creation, the ones that serve you. Again, every situation, every situation is fundamentally neutral. And you provide the meaning. Whatever meaning you provide, negative or positive, will be the effect that you experience. And you know, upon reflection, I realized that in my own dream work or dream life, I had been blue-prane. That belief, that all of these so-called negatives, or whatever can be handled readily, that we are absolutely the creators of our reality. If I might share a dream with you briefly. All right, but before you do, in what way was this notion, a, again, we refrain from using the terminology, but you did problem? It seems to me that in my experience, what tends to throw me off? Oh, probably. I perceive myself as doing nicely along, creating my preferred reality, and suddenly a cop pulls me over. Well, all right now, that also is a neutral situation. What meaning do you assign it? Well, it's, I used to assign it, sort of, a flood in the beauty. And, but I don't know what today is, of course, I'd give it to the opponent. So then, in what way is it a problem? Well, I was explaining why your idea occurred to you as something of a problem. It seems to me that as we create our existences, our preferred realities, well, in my personal experience, sometimes it seems to me I can be thrown off track, you know, rather easily. Whether a cop or an acid phone call, or just a dad, and I find myself in some other reality. In a sense, you are re-assuming your old belief systems when you feel that in that moment. It is not thrown off. It is choosing to, again, re-assume an older, less preferred, apparently, belief. Right. So, at any rate, it was an issue of interest to me, and I had been pondering it. I realized that I, myself, had been teaching myself through a dream. So, now, I had a dream called the Manifestation Factory. Oh, how are you hiding? My better dreams are always tight. I'm a driver of all of the fantasy sports. And I saw this really hot number. Hot number? We understand. The lady is young and here, and she heard my pullover, and I asked her if she would like to go to an event with perhaps a channel. Put her hand up. She got into the car. And the question is, is that she needed a more appropriate dress for the event. I think that's what I want to do. I took her immediately to the Manifestation Factory. I had just the thing. I drove up to the factory, and there were huge gigs there. I mean, I had just been there. Most of the four of the children, not so you came, but how close. And I was like, oh, my God. So, rather than being stopped by the fact that these monsters get into the box, I simply drew it right through them. And then, in front of the factory, a very large factory, devoid of lights, as far as I can see. And I have all the shades with bold lines redone, big signs on the door, same clothes, and applications for employment, not a separate. There were lots of scurries and things. So I drove around the factory, around and around. It was, it helped me to tell her that thought it was locked. And just when I was about to be a hopeless, you know, I saw a window open and an old chrome stuck a dustin off out and started shaking. And I said, this is the Manifestation Factory. I need to get in. And she said, well, we're closed. We closed it by three. So we call it, okay. Listen, let me talk to the owner. You are the owner. Exactly. That's what she said. She said we're going to be slowly more than we are. All right. Did not need to inject the judgment, but go on. And you closed this last 30. I said, well, I came to the Men's Relief. It spirals my girlfriend. And I said to the old chrome, well, in that case, open it up right now. And she said to me, well, okay. But only the owner time. You know, very pretty. I did. No. So, well, if I get to the point of us, I have been programming myself through the dream of the work to, in a sense, override any seeming obstacle to what I want. Well, your willingness to persist in what you believe yourself to be will only always have that result. There are many examples here this evening of your time of that idea. If you will live this dream in much the same way, you will also open your manifestation factory. And in fact, if you wish, it can become a 24-hour venture. In that type of affair. Is that all? Yes. Thank you very much for your willingness to open your own doors. And simply, it is not so laborious. Relax. Enjoy. Have some fun. Do not need to work over time. All right? All right. Zero. Is that all? Well, I have a lot of other questions of course. How about one? Well, my son tonight is here from Wisconsin. Greetings. And he goes to a school by the name of the loit. And he's studying anthropology. I'm wondering, in your civilization, is there such a profession as anthropology? The idea would seem more in your translation like a hobby. We have no professions as such. And simply do what excites us, if that is the propensity of particular individuals, then they will pursue that end. But it is not so rigidized. There is much more spontaneity in the creation and not the need to box ourselves in to one particular idea. Well, could you tell us anything about the anthropology, the background of man in the area of the loit, Wisconsin? Not really. I've never been there. And we thank you. Sharing. You, then you. I have an unfair question. All right. Not really. But go on. In two days, I'll be 62 years old. All right. And the question is, well, I have to reincarnate war during this life. I see such items as unlimited pollution-free energy or teleportation or transition of the planet to poor density. Will you have to reincarnate? You have not decided. Will you see these things? You may. Why do you feel that question to be unfair? Because it involves how long am I going to live on in this life? And I know you don't like to predict such things. In a sense, you have not yet decided. Therefore, it is quite open. Why are you stuck with me? Just how long I live? Yes. In a sense. Not always will it be conscious, but now that you are understanding just how much? 100%. You create your own reality. You can become more conscious of the timing. But those three items will occur on this planet. Those three items will occur and you may see some of them. Do you wish to? I wish to see them in this life. Go right. And do understand it is that simple. Make the conscious commandment have the clear intention and proceed with clear action. I want to even be a parent of some of those. You already are. Are you not? I'm not talking about my trip to Ohio. The channel does giving us access. Very good. Would you briefly, briefly explain the concept to those who are here? I came back from the trip to Ohio checking out something that has interested me for quite a few months. The concept of converting water H2O into hydrogen and oxygen, burning the hydrogen in a controlled safe manner. And using it as fuel, the first target would appear to be retrofitting any car or truck with a kit so that you would use water instead of gasoline, let's say, to drive around. And for a long distance, maybe again, only the water. I came back as you appear to know, which are after going further into depth as a director with a distributor ship to distribute and put in a business to provide these reference kits to cars in this area. And the only aspect that I came back with that is not to my preference is that it would appear their best estimate is it might be like two years before these kits would be available in production quantity as a brief as I could be. You do not have to emphasize having gone into depth. You can emphasize your excitement about the idea and your willingness to commit to some aspect of it. There is a distinction. If you will continue to focus on having gone into depth, you will begin to experience the effects of having gone into depth. If you will simply function from the excitement you have for that particular project, you will experience more excitement and more acceleration of the project. Thank you for allowing us to point that out. The only reason I went into depth is because I am incredibly excited about being a part. But you do not have to look at it as an indebtedness. Simply your ability to rearrange your resources, your resources, your abundance. I am on the job market again as of September 4th. How excited? Because of my belief system, I am looking forward in a positive manner to do more wonderful things that I have been doing for the last six months. But there will be this interim period before I get involved with the production quantity of these kits I reference. Therefore giving you a sparkling opportunity to do what excites you in any given moment and begin to see that trusting that brings along all the abundance you need to continue to do the exciting things. You can struggle and strive. You look around for a new job you don't really want. Or you can begin right now to do what excites you. And then there will be no experience of indebtedness. Where do you wish to focus your consciousness on your excitement thereby yielding the experience of excitement and then the perpetuation of more excitement or your obligations and debt thereby enhancing your experience and perpetuation of your obligation and debt? It will always be up to you. Listen to how you choose two word things. That is indicative of what you truly believe. Now down the beliefs you do not prefer and change them if you wish. I will make positive choices. Thank you. And to you as well. Over there I am female. Hi Bishar. And to you. I want to share and then have two questions. Do share. I want to share that I am very excited about the changes that have taken place in me over the last three months. I want to share that I have truly begun to experience my completeness. And it's very exciting. How exciting. And thank you. And thank you too. You have done it all yourself. With your help. I am merely acting as a reflection to you. You can only understand what I am saying because you contain it in the first place. As we have said, when you ask a question and someone gives an answer and you say that's right, how do you know? Obviously you must contain it. So therefore I am willing and most glad to act as a reflection. But I can only be, as shall we say, clear a mirror as your originating source of life. So therefore I thank you. Do proceed. Okay. My first question is about concepts that is coming through some channels from extraterrestrial to the back. Just inviting spirits and their ability to play on people. Now this is not within my personal beliefs, it's in my personal reality. In a sense in the way that you mean, nor ours. Our perspective on that matter is understanding that everything is an external reflection of you. That these quote unquote external beings are simply aspects of yourself. The technique which have been discussed in order to loosely speaking. Bring those spirits back to the light is a very wonderful symbolic exercise in integrating aspects of your particular personality. Your particular consciousness. You can use symbolically the idea of them being separate from you, but it is only an illusion. It is simply integrating aspects of yourself using symbols which can also work. It is a very valid, very effective methodology. That's exactly how I see it. And what I have trouble with is there was a true healing energy involved. That is because you integrated aspects of yourself. And of course you would then experience having aligned yourself with your purpose, a healing. Okay. All right. You have done it all. That's right. The idea that there are external, this embodied being gives away your power. You do not have to look at them that way. It is up to you. The other question is about the channeling I did with you. When you asked me who was the being that was speaking through me, and to say the first thing that came to me, I heard the name Shira. Shira, yes. Then the information that came afterward with the mentions that the being was from and so forth, I doubt it. All right. You had a trust in something else. Because again, doubt is not a lack of trust. It is an unswerving trust in something you don't prefer. Could you please validate what was true about this and what I heard correctly? And as we're learning to channel, in certain ways, my channel is very clear. From our perspective of the energy, your rendering of it was accurate. And that is all we will say. Data was true. Not necessarily the particular designation. Okay. Because I felt afterwards to be was not from data. Oh. It didn't bring through. Oh. Then that was your opportunity to learn discernment. However, the exercise was in bringing through the information. Without analysis. Without doubt. Without thinking. Just letting it come out as it is transmitted. In that particular instance, your mind in that particular instance was focused on something else. Shira from F time. No comment. That is your exploration. And there is great joy in that exploration. You will tell me. Does the being have any information or message to me tonight? Ask her. This is not our unwillingness to participate with you. This is our total willingness to self-empower you. It is your agreement. You are linked. Use it. And you. Shira. Shira. You. I have two questions. Oh, I know one. Number one is from a Judea Christian point of view. Oh. It is life after a corporeal state of being the man or does it really exist. Ask the question again. From a point of view, do we believe from a man-made concept? That there is life after. In your realm, do you believe or have you seen that there is life after? In our realm, we have seen that there is. However, there are two notions which would seem to be mutually exclusive in your religions, however, they are not. One is, this is the only life. Another is, you lead many lives in succession. From our perspective, you are made very literally, as your biblical literature says, in the image and likeness of God or all that is. This means you are multi-dimensional, infinite, and eternal. The idea is that that aspect, what you would label reincarnation, is a reality. However, that you only have this one life to live in a sense is also a reality. For even though you do, colloquially speaking, reincarnate, you will only be this you one time. So therefore, they are both true. And the original contents of your Bible said this. They were deleted. The references to reincarnation, except for a few, that still remain, were deleted. The second question is, I find it very difficult to deal with the concept that certain people are born into a life where they will be misery, they will be pain and disease. Is this predetermined by us before we are born? In a sense, though again, remember what we had said at the onset of this interaction. You create both consciously and unconsciously. The last 25,000 years of your history has been, shall we say, a cycle of limitation, a cycle of unconscious creation. This is now the cycle of integration, beginning, so you are, in a sense, waking up. One of the, shall we say, beliefs, but most strongly into by individuals and your planets that believe in reincarnation. And therefore, this is somewhat instilled within what you may label your mass consciousness, is what you label the law of karma. However, what they do not tell you is that that law is self-imposed. However, when you do impose it upon yourself, you will experience it. And much of the being born into misery is just that idea. Individuals imposing upon themselves karma, but it is self-imposed. In actuality, when you quote unquote die or transform from this reality to the next, what happens at the time of death is determined by exactly like this reality is what you believe most strongly. Therefore, when you transform in that way, what you will initially experience will be your strongest belief. Therefore, if you believe in heaven or hell, you will create that type of scenario. If you believe in reincarnation, which again is sort of an archetypal sub-stream thought throughout your society, you will experience the effects of that. If you understand that what you will experience is according to your belief, and now you are waking up to be a conscious creator, you can consciously determine and decide upon transforming what you will do. It is very malleable. Does this make sense? Yes. Is that all? That's not a good one. And do you as well? Over there in the mail? Sure, good evening. And do you? I have three questions. Number one. There is a group that calls themselves Mission Control. It is ET Ground Forces. You are familiar with them? We understand the concept. Yes. Do you have any particular functional relationship with either the ground crew or their support crew that surrounds the planet? In a sense, yes. More the idea of the support crew. Though, shall we say again loosely speaking, ground crew members will tap into our energy from time to time. I see. So there is an alignment, definite alignment between you and those forces? Between all forces that are positively assisting with the transition of your planet. But again from our perspective, it is simply an enhancement. They are not saving you. You are not drowning. I understand. They have an understanding that the support crew is fifth dimensional and that what is taking place as the planet goes through its transmutation is that the planet is actually moving from third to fifth density. All right. This is simply a difference in nomenclature and would translate into our terminology from third to fourth density. I understand. You would not want to miss four. No. So then your fourth, would you call the fourth density is not what some call the astral plane? No. Not exactly. Though there are overlapping overlays within third and fourth density of what you label the astral plane. It is simply, shall we say, a reality that is slightly out of sync with what you consider to be your solid reality. And when you reorient your consciousness into that realm, that is why you appear to be most a lyric, most ghost-like because of that out of sync idea. It is the astral plane that produces this phenomenon, not the fourth density per se. It is your shift in perception of your totality. Again, you exist upon all levels and when you choose to open your eyes upon a different level that you already exist on, that is one of the available examples. I understand. It is also their understanding, Bishore, that as the planet moves into fifth density and the being sphere from transmittent movement to fifth density, that their experience will continue on this planet having transmuted to the fifth density. Therefore, again, that is why we label it fourth. Fourth is colloquially speaking limited physicality. Fourth is colloquially speaking less limited, more unlimited physicality. And from our, shall we say, model of reality, fifth is non-physical. I understand. Is it usual that a people that evolve with a planet remain in association with that planet as they continue their explorations in, shall we say, more rarefying densities? In a sense, yes. Okay. However, there is the option to explore within the fourth density other areas of experience on other planets per se. We'll always be up to the individual. At that point, you are consciously creating, consciously making decisions. Certain, shall we say, individual groups of souls, shall we say, will choose to remain in a particular focus. Others may choose to move on to other ideas depending upon their purposes. It is very loose in that sense. So even those who choose not to go into fourth density, and again, then we get into a discussion on parallel realities. For everyone gets what it is, they will surely buy into. No exceptions. Thank you. Is it your experience that, on your planet, that you move from life to life with the same group of people per se? In much of the way that you mean yes. Thank you very much. Anthony, you're listening. Sure. Yes. I have a question. You talked about parallel realities. Yes. I was wondering, like the different people who can exist at the same time, are not speech-other or... Well, in a sense. What I want to know is there any way with what we determine physical, hard science to detect something like that? At this time in your technology, no. As you begin to understand the electro-acemic nature of what you label your auric field around your body and begin to measure things of that nature, energies of that nature, yes. Is that all? Yes. Thank you very much. Sure. Yes. Mr. Shah, two questions. Yes. First is, a few meetings ago, you talked about sometimes when we're really coming into our own reality and starting to express it. We do a crazy phenomenon. We ground our snow. Mr. Shah, could you ask me... I understand that was not a quote. No. Yes. Thank you. One more question. One more question. Well, that's part of the question. Why do we ground our snow, Mr. Shah? Again, we are not sure we understand what you are asking, but what we are saying is this. It is okay to have your head in the clouds, but keep your feet firmly on the ground, for you have chosen to be within a physical reality. Therefore, do not deny the very reality you have chosen. Do not ascribe a higher value to spirituality than physicality. Physicality is an aspect or expression of spirituality. They are one and the same. We are simply talking about equalizing all ideas as being equally valid and using the very physicality you came down here to experience, rather than denying it and escaping to a spirituality. So the idea of remaining grounded is simply to use what you have created again. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Next question. I forgot when I was thinking about it. Oh, and we do as well, sharing. Yes. Hello. And greetings to you. I have two sharings and a question. Recently, I began to have an access in my heart, my daughter, to my mouth. And I have had them before. They've lasted a week or ten days and been very painful. And when I felt this starting, I sent to myself, this is a neutral situation, and I assigned a meeting. So I'm going to assign a positive meeting. All right. It was in an area where I have a pocket. And I decided that this was going to help it. And we're going to not hurt my mouth and that I didn't have to have any pain. And that I just brought this. And within a day it was gone. Well, all right. Thank you very much. It is that simple. If you are that in touch with what you truly believe now, if you truly believe this wasn't so, and you are, quote unquote, deluding yourself, you may have gotten a different effect. But apparently, this was not so. And the thing to defy your medical explanation, does it not? That is because you created all. Well, it was one way of finding out what I believe. You used your creation, allowing it to transform. When things seem to repeat, you are giving it the same label. Therefore, the repeat is the same effect. When you find things in your life to repeat, if you will be willing to give it a different label and glean a different meaning and allow it to deliver the message of service that it is to you, it will transform. As you have illustrated. I had another instance recently. One thing that really makes me freak out when I can't find something. Oh, freak out. And I couldn't find a piece of paper with directions on it. And sure enough, I freak out. And when they come down and let it play for a few minutes, I found it. That is what you will find with the majority of the things you quote unquote lose upon your planet. For the idea is, you are insisting on a particular timing, and that may not exactly be the most conducive timing from the overall picture. Then, very often, individuals do initiate this cycle of franticness and freak out. And there was no rush. I didn't have to find it for a week. So there was no need for insisting on this timing. And after it was over, I thought to myself, now what lesson is it that what can I learn from this? Relent, light. Well, the thing I thought of was, what is the opposite of frustration? And as you say, it's trust. Because I felt really frustrated. So I thought about the opposite of being trust. And I thought, what is it I was trusting in? And I realized I was trusting that I wouldn't find it, which was really illogical. Because it was a value to me, and the chances of my losing it were not nearly as high as the chances of my having it. So I was trusting in a very illogical viewpoint. Whereas I should have been trusting that I would find it. And not insist on having it that minute, and not freak out. And I'm hoping next time I'll have better control over what I'm creating. Well, I do not have to hope, hope implies doubt. Simply do the same thing, and you will get a similar effect just as you had gotten a similar effect previous by freaking out. Yeah. And I have one question that I need clarification. I asked this before, but I can't seem to get it clear. Well, let's look at it again. And for the first time. Okay. Can an animal ever become a human? Yes. Okay. So I could have been a horse. Perhaps. Okay, but the name, okay, great. That's little fat. Now, it is not, shall we say, the most common thing, but it does occur. It depends on the exploration of the particular focus of consciousness. In general species, in general reincarnate within that species, but there are exceptions. Forever? Have you always? Well, in a sense, you can say, no, not forever. The exploration changes when the overall purpose is served. And in general, at least in a physical finite way, species do not exist forever. Species do not exist forever? In a physical way, necessarily. Okay. Is that all? Yes. Thank you. And I'm going to ask you, for your willingness to act, that is what will transform your reality. Your willingness to not simply think this sounds nice, but to apply it. And again, we guarantee 100%, and you seem to like that on your planet. That if you do it, you will see a change for the positive. That is the only guarantee we can make. And we thank you for taking us up on the offer. Thank you. And to you. Sharing. Yes. We're in greetings again. And to you. To continue the question of lost objects, is some, a few of us perhaps believe that certain times we put something somewhere, we look at there again, it's not there. And I'd add two later, there it is again. And then objects may actually lose their aspect of locations temporarily, or may exist in a lesser way. Although it is possible, and although it may occur, it is extremely rare. And it is far more what has just been discussed in that once you get into the mode of being frantic, you cannot see what is right in front of your face. Literally. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. recreating a past, recreating a future, but right there with what's right there. Then you can again use it to its greatest advantage. Use it for the very reason you created it in a conscious way. Is that of assistance? Just thank you. And you as well. Sharing. You. Then you. In between lines or incarnations, is there a sense of identity that we maintain? Oh yes. So, as I said, a person knows who he is in between experiences and exploration. In general, yes. Individuals who buy very firmly into particular styles of karma may, however, literally whisk themselves into the next experience. But in general, that is available, particularly now, that we have shared the ideas that your beliefs create that experience. That gives you the opportunity to do it in a conscious way. Is there not the opportunity for beings to hang out in that inner phase plane and share experiences and the like? Oh yes. So, in a sense, itself is a valid exploration. A sign of reflection and integration. Obviously. Thank you. All explorations are valid. All are equal. Is that all? That's all. And to you over there. The sign. Yes. What happens to pieces that no longer exist? In general, the purposes of exploration of that particular style of physicality has been played out. And then, in general, there is a new style that is explored. One example again is your dinosaurs. That exploration was done with. Any of the particulars as to how the actual extinction took place is inconsequential. The exploration was done with, and any of the actual methodologies were a symptom of that completion of cycle. So, if you're the giant for each giant for an individual reincarnating entity or... In a sense that you mean yes. Okay, thank you. Thank you as well. Sure. Yes. I remember my question. Oh, thank you. Sure. What's the difference between giant and being teleported? In general, your definition of teleportation is first taking up residence in one particular area, and immediately relocating to another while still alive. Completely? That is, shall we say, the typical definition upon your planet of teleportation, yes? Relocating your physicalized body from one place to another instantaneously. Therefore, by your own definition, it differs from death because you are still alive while it is occurring. And the place you left, do the people here know that you're born? It will depend. If individuals are firmly in agreement that such a thing is not possible, those individuals will not be around to see it. If you are, shall we say, hanging out with individuals, exploring that type of reality and loosening up the mass agreement about the inability to do that, they may witness it. But in general, most individuals do not believe that it is possible, so in general... That difference defines the end-out with more individuals that absolutely believe that I'm creating an affinity to affect it. You do not need those individuals to create that reality. You simply need to look at the beliefs that you have about that you cannot do it, replace them with ones that you can. If you wish to facilitate the process and accelerate it to happen more quickly, seek out individuals upon your planet who are already doing it. They are of that vibration and by mimicking them in your own particular style and way, you will also have that reality and be able to share that recognition. For again, both has agreed to loosen up on that agreement. But you will never be able to impose upon individuals agreeing that such a thing is not possible, that it is. Therefore, you will not infringe on their reality. Is it possible for us to teleport to a level to be with someone who is already......tacked over? In the sense that you mean, no. In that particular aspect, your most conducive meeting ground is your sleeping dream reality. Is that your meeting ground? No. What I know they're meeting ground. What you label your astral state, if you expand your awareness to that point, is also a possible meeting ground. In general, it seems less likely to individuals on your society. It is that you need someone you die and you need someone you love. Is that really someone you love or is that just a good thought for you created in your own heart? It can be either. It can also be another individual guide or spirit, assuming that, shall we say, masquerade for your comfort, your convenience, your acclimatizing to the new reality. It can be then, it can be an aspect of yourself, it can be another being altogether. You don't know the difference? In a sense, it does not matter. Your experience is of that individual. But again, when you expand and shall we say, all right, loosely speaking, attend orientation for that reality, then if you wish, you can determine which it was. Thank you. I do. I too follow the question I almost had earlier. The question that's close to my heart. Recently, I saw it in one of your older tapes in which you were channeled by Daryl. A gentleman asked you a question as to whether you had questions about life here on Earth. I don't recall specifically your answer, but as what I recall is that you were perplexed by our... By why individuals in your society insist on denying themselves all the ecstasy they can muster. That, in a sense, was a bit baffling to us. We since understand the exploration. I was going to say that I was going to make a question. What if you found out, since? We simply understand that it is another valid exploration, and one of the joys of this transformational age is beginning this particular lifespan in a limited fashion, experiencing the transformation, and in the same lifespan with the same body beginning to live in a more unlimited physicality. This is a very exciting time upon your planet. Your transformation from, again colloquially speaking, old to new age. I was pondering the whole matter of a disability connection with that discussion that I'm hearing. And it seems to me that this is a point that people often get stuck on, the question of a disability. Oh very good. And that is simply their unwillingness to treat themselves with the same respect that all that is treats you with. For you are always unconditionally loved by what you label God. Yes, I think perhaps the reason the problem here is that the symbolism you have, even the symbolism on your type of level of God are too limited. Well the idea is you are made in the image and likeness of all that is. However individuals in your society many times ascribe that God is made in the image of man. And therefore shall we say aspects of exploring mankind are attributed to all that is, but all that is is transcendental and not limited to that particular separation view point. All that is is all that is and does not in that sense perpetuate judgment, perpetuate anger, perpetuate fear. These are again loosely speaking man made concepts and when you ascribe them to God you then get the idea of a vengeful God, original sin. That is not our perspective at all. And in fact is a denial of your ecstasy, denial of the gift be queethed upon you of creation. You did not have to do anything to deserve to exist. Therefore all that is feels you deserve to exist. Therefore all that is feels you deserve to create that which you desire with integrity, which would mean not harming yourself or others. Therefore treat yourself with the same respect. Lack of deserve ability is simply a belief. You set up the morals and you judge yourself by your own moral standard. I also believe that when the individual truly fully gets the idea that God is everything, everything, everything. All that is in eons, acrylics, water columns, and Los Angeleses, then it becomes easy to fit in. It becomes easy to begin to see how things relate to you in a positive way. It becomes easy to understand how things are now of service to you. You can go around your life saying poor little old me, why is this happening to me? Or you can say how does this serve me exactly like it is. That is a conscious creator. That is the sentiment of thank you. Thank you. Will that surprise you? Yes. The idea of you create your own reality, maybe a dangerous concept. In a sense you do not trust your creatorhood possibly you could create that experience. If you create your own reality with an integration intention, a loving unconditionally loving intention, it is quite safe. When we speak about doing what excites you, we always talk about doing it with integrity. Integrity is a recognition that everything is all one thing, integration. Sure, do you want psychosis first? We understand the concept. Out of touch with a particular definition of reality. We as humans have a collective sense of what reality is. Yes. And those who are experiencing different realities no less real than yours are labeled insane. For they have no way to communicate the very real and valid realities they are experiencing. When they can, they are labeled genius. When they cannot, they are labeled insane. So you may say geniuses are psychotic also. Are those people who are considered to be psychotic are they then thought to be simply in a different reality for helping? Well in a sense, but do understand that within your society when individuals are unable to communicate their particular form of reality they are greatly invalidated. Therefore their resulting actions may seem quite antisocial. There is no support for the reality they are experiencing. So it becomes unhealthy when they are judged from the society. The one more question please. How about an intake of a drug to reduce a different reality? Is that a drug induced reality just as real as a reality that is created without the inducement of drugs? The idea is that these tools are keys or triggers to allowing you in what you consider to be an acceptable way you believe it will work to experience other aspects of your own consciousness. From our perspective though the drug does not create the effect. You create the effect and use the drug as an excuse for having done so. So if you will take the symbol and use it to allow you to see what you can create by yourself it can be of service to you. If you get hung up on the symbol and give your power away to it you know what happens. There is a distinction. Therefore it can be a key or it can seem like a curse. It will depend. But you create the effect. I know that is not popular upon your planet and there are shall we say elaborate belief systems with their self-sustaining, perpetuated system of logic terms of chemical reactions and so on and so forth. That is simply a belief. It is all from consciousness. And again even if you don't believe you are creating it you are creating that. Does this make any sense whatsoever? Yes completely. It is a treat to understand that you do indeed create and begin to think rather than it being dangerous that you can do so according to preference. You are never given too much to handle. Whatever level you receive something at you are at that level to match it. Therefore you need not fear your power. Simply again re-align yourself with integration. If you are all one thing and everything is an aspect of you you would not chop off your own hand. You would not shoot your own foot. You would not try to convince your little finger. You would not in that way in any way shape or form choose to lie to your left leg. Treat everything as though it is an extension of yourself and you are getting the idea. Is that all? Yes. That's all. And we thank you. Shit yes. Energy in a sense you may label as the overall stuff of creation. It depends upon definitions. One moment one moment. When you speak about energy in terms of electricity that is a product of vibration. When you in a sense speak about free energy that is again the fabric of creation and the different vibratory frequencies which it assumes determines the shape or form it seems to take. You are all a particular vibratory frequency. There is some limitation in language in explaining this idea for your idea of frequency is simply a two dimensional pictorial representation. This is a two dimensional symbol of a three dimensional interpretation of a fourth dimensional concept of a fifth density reality. So therefore again when we say vibration we do not mean in the sense limited literal sense that you may mean. But every particular idea is of a different varying frequency and that is what gives it its specific uniqueness and allows you to identify it as something different. Just as well as what makes one object different from another in vibration the seeming same to objects which are in different locations have the difference in their vibration which corresponds to their position in space and time. For also your position in space and time is part of your overall vibration. You have a notion on your planet that you exist within space and time. Our understanding is that space and time is a property of the object. But has this answered the question. Alright can you be a bit more specific. Your last statement. I was speaking of personal energy. Do you mean consciousness? That's what I was going to ask. It's personal energy where you are in consciousness. I feel that I have tremendous energy within it. Now is that the same as consciousness? Is that the same as vibration? In a sense you can say what we perceive you are speaking of. Are aspects of your consciousness that have particular vibrations and you are in the sense sensing the vibratory patterns of the energy. Does this make sense? Does it answer the question? There is some confusion and translation on the part of the channel. But again there is something more specific that occurs to you. Please feel free to share again. Do you raise your vibration and your energy? By doing what excites you the most you come in alignment with the purpose of your soul or higher self. By acting that way you do physically raise the vibration of your beingness. As you raise that vibration you only attract the reality you are the vibration of. So the things that you attract will differ. As you in a sense align with your higher self. What you will attract via that vibration will be representative of your new understanding of yourself. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. For sure you said that the physiological channel before us has a counterpart with self existing on your flame and is in close association with you. In fact in a sense it would not mostly be appropriately labeled a counterpart. More appropriately labeled a future self. Understand again we are communicating from with you from what you would label approximately 300 years in your future. Because again time and space are actually one idea space time. We are able to transcend this degree of space and time as well. One idea one ability brings along with it the other. Do go on. I see. Do I have a future self as well in close association with you. What do you think? And does everyone else. You are getting the idea. So the people that are strongly drawn to these interactions they do in fact have a future self in close association with you as well. Not always. No. And you're 150 years in the future. 300 approximately 300 years in the future. Technologically about 150 years ahead of us. Yes although when we began communicating with you in your early 1980s it was more like 300. So the bottom line is technologically consciousness wise you have made leaps and down. I see. But these times all co-exist in the moment. Yes. So in fact it's not really moving through time. There's an acknowledgement of the synchronicity of time. Yes. Thank you. Is that all? That's all. Mail over there. Yes. So this time becomes less important to us on earth and to the point where it's not existent and will age become less important than to us will we. Long generally will increase but in general in any physical finite reality by definition you will have some experience of time when you transcend fourth to fifth density non-physical than not. Physicality shall we say the creation of space and the ability to move across it necessitates time to do so. What other questions? As you do what excites you the most you create less time. That is why you have the same time flies by when you're having fun. No. You create less time when you are in the moment. When you are not resisting who you are you create less time. You create less time and experience time in a different way. My other question is one wants to ask the question telepathically to instead of just verbally asking it like the new internet. How does that talk to you? Yes. However the answer will also come telepathically. So in my answer to the question. I'll ask the answer. Would you be able to repeat this question? Go right ahead. Oh, will we be able to repeat the question out loud in general? No. Okay. But we will answer it. Okay. I will ask the question. I'll ask the question. I'll try it. You're not trying. Do it. Will you share the answer? I get. Yes. Will you share the question? The question was, what are the ever languages on your planet in your earlier stages of your storytelling? Thank you very much. We will have time for about one more sharing. Sharing. The shark? Yes. The woman that I met this week truly awakens. All right. No comment. Would you like a replacement question? We would rather you decide that for yourself. We will discuss it in a future of interaction. And are not impounded in any way. Simply allowing you to roll it on consciousness for particular reason. Trust me. Yeah. Yeah. Not a trusted. Do you have another question? Are you asking one telepathically also? I don't know. I think that I'm exploring this with trusting spirit. And when I feel something that feel right. May we simplify it for you? Thank you. I invite you in any given moment that is the indication of your spirit. That is what we have been saying all along. And you are your spirit. Do not make the separation. You are it. You are not connected to all that is. That implies the separation. You are an aspect of all that. Not such a surprise as a lover. All right. We will however allow for one more sharing. Shady. Yes. I want to share. I just want to extend to you with my gratitude and my love for being here. For being part of our group for creating the rest of reality. And that's all. Allow me to reflect back to you the same. And as well simply say, you are about to walk through a door. Have a good trip. Ah, this timing. Allow me once again. And for the first time. To thank you. Thank you all. Your willingness to look at your totality rather than your fragmentation is the only thing that enables us to communicate with you. Because we also only experience the reality we are the vibration of. You must contain what we are saying or we would be communicating through this channel. You would see the lips moving and hear no words. You can only hear something if you already contain it. Any feeling that you sense comes from us. You already contain. You are creating that feeling. We are always very glad to act as reflections in this way but will always remind you. You are doing it. You contain it. Whatever joy you experience in interacting with me is the joy you contain within yourself. You are creating that joy. You are using me as an excuse and I will allow you to do so. But I will always remind you of the mechanism. Use what you have created. That is conscious. Consciously create your reality according to preference if you desire. By using the creations in your life you will transform what you may consider to be old negative momentals. You will transform them. Needless to say by giving the same label you will continue to get the same effect. But when you will be willing to acknowledge and appreciate and glean what service any symbol is being to you, then you will be consciously creating and you will generate preference after preference. You will enter a phase of your life that we sometimes will be ecstatic explosion of coincidence and synchronicity. Everything you desire will be provided to you from you. It will seem to come from coincidence because coincidence things happening at the same time are all related. When you look at the big picture you will see this. When you allow the big picture to serve you you will be it. So therefore again thank you. And we wish you a most fond and loving. Good evening.
