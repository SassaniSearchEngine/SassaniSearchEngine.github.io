 Alright, I'll say, continue sharing. Female. Greetings of shining one. Thank you very much. Can I ask you a question? What does that mean? Simply that your light shines bright and can be easily seen from vast distances. Does that make sense to you? Yeah, pretty much. Oh, you are all fundamentally, perhaps you can say, in one way of looking at it, creatures of light. You are emanating from the white light of infinite creation. Perhaps now you only perceive yourselves as little sparks, but those sparks contain the totality of all the light. Simply, you are willing to express that light to a high degree. So I thank you. Do proceed. I'd like to share something to you. Oh, my mom recently wanted to get a job, and she wanted a job interview, and before she went there, she sent a prayer to Jesus. And when she got there, the guy was really nice to her, and he gave her his card. When she got home, she looked at it, and it was priced with an O on it. Oh, what a coincidence. And she also got the job. Aah! A night coach. Does that mean anything special, or is it just a coincidence, like you said? Aah! Everything, as I had mentioned, is purposeful, has meaning, if you will allow yourself to see it, to perceive it. So it had meaning in that an intention was put forth, a decision was made, to the degree that it was trusted and your mother acted, she got the result. The symbol through which the trust was placed was perhaps one time removed, but that is one of the tools that your society uses. What you call that particular, shall I say, viewpoint of what you call Jesus or the Christ. Now I remind you that the Christ is an energy within each and every one of you. It is the tie that binds you. It is the unconditionally loving white light that we were speaking of. The person or the manifestation you referred to as Jesus Christ was a person willing to walk, shining that light, being that light, being that person. Not to convince anyone of anything, but simply to demonstrate that not only do he or I contain that, but so do you all contain it. And you can walk it. You can live it. You can breathe it. That was the actual symbol. That was the actual life that you refer to as the life of Christ. Then later other individuals in describing that scenario attach many of their own agendas and many of their own meanings to it. But the actual message, the actual statement made was we all contain this creative force, the Christ within. We all can express it and if you are willing to walk with unconditional love, shining that light, being the person you know yourself to be, you too can be a living example of that light. So therefore it is a very powerful symbol with a lot of meaning. Oh, thank her. Thank you. I'd like to know, just out of curiosity, my father was telling me something and I want to know if it's true. Oh, verification. I want to know, in some kind of a teacher, will I meet you in person? Would you like to? Of course. I don't understand that it is most likely. Are you willing to be somewhat, shall I say? Versatile, or are you willing to be somewhat, willing to allow our meeting, our interaction, to take place in what you call any fashion that it will? Yeah. Oh, watch what you call your nighttime sleeping dream. It would be more likely that our first encounter could be in that walking ground. For that method of reality creation, for your dreams at night, are literally realities that you create within you, is a little bit closer to our actual reality that we experience as a reality. So it is an easier place for us to meet with the current state of your society. For until your society decides unmasked to invite us, we will decide our decision is to remain in the background to such an invitation as place. But this does not preclude meeting with individuals in what you call the dream state. All right? Yes. Then it's the date. Is that all? Yes, it is. Oh, thank you. Mike? Yes, I'd like to have your interpretation from your perspective on what many people here on Earth call liberation. And what you perceive as once that is accomplished, how the person would change, how they would go, what they would be doing, what's the word liberated from the Earth's reality? One moment. Now when you say liberation, that is one thing. When you say liberated from the Earth's reality, that has a whole different connotation to it. Allow me to explain. When you say liberated from the Earth's reality, it presupposes, it assumes that you are trapped entombed or jailed in the Earth's reality to begin with and therefore must be liberated, let out, so to speak. It is not my perspective nor will it ever be that this reality is anything but a choice. Now, part of the interesting quality of choosing to be a physical being is, shall I say, perhaps in the fine print of the contract that you make with yourself, the fact that you forget that you made the choice. So therefore, when you are functioning as though you have forgotten that you chose to be here, you can create the aparency of being trapped here. But simply being willing to entertain the idea that you did choose to be here, the side that you did choose to be here allows you to begin to see why you chose to be here. When you choose to be somewhere and are aware that you have chosen it, there is no other place you'd rather be. So to answer both questions, that is the definition of liberation in my opinion. Being willing to liberate yourself from the notion that you are trapped. Being willing to liberate yourself from the ties that you bind yourself with and allow yourself to create this life, enjoy, in love effortlessly, according to preference, creating, sharing, experiencing life. That is a liberation from the bondage of separation and limitation, but a liberation within this reality, into this reality. Liberating your great power and strength that you have assumed does not exist, to be able to experience this life fully. Therefore, once you do so, the entire face of your life changes. But you do not disappear. You do not ascend into a different reality because you have just woken up to the fact that you chose to be here and now you get your feet on the ground and move around in fascination from place to place, experience to experience, relationship to relationship, drinking it all in, eagerly like a child with that attitude of fascination, eagerness, willingness, readiness, surprise. How does that sound? It sounds pretty good. You are saying that you don't necessarily graduate from, let's say, dating to be an Earth in a necessarily, an episode of a place where it fit in a little bit better. Here is the paradox. In order to so to speak, put yourself in the conducive atmosphere to decide to do something else. You will first accept what you are doing and do it fully. When you are doing it fully and creating a life that is what you call pleasant, you are not in such a hurry to go anywhere and do not look at moving somewhere else as graduating, as do's paying, but simply look at it as something else to do. There is a difference in attitude, a difference in approach. You are not jailed here. You must suffer and pay your dues to get out of here. Certainly that is one way to look at it. When you look at it that way, it brings along the connotation of a liberation, of an ascension into something better. But the paradox is that there is nothing better, only different. And what allows you to be more fully, shall I say, liable to walk into a new reality is simply playing out this reality to the point where you have gotten out of it and what you came into it to experience. And that would always presuppose that you become consciously aware of the decision to be here, consciously aware of who you want to be now that you remember that you decided to be here and consciously aware of the experience of that person. In a sense, you kind of come full circle with the whole idea to become a point where you are full awareness, returns, and you remember your decision to come into the reality, so to speak. Well, at first you make the decision to remember. Well, I decide I chose to be here. Therefore, I will begin to trust that decision and begin to act like I chose to be here, a person who chooses to be somewhere, acts far differently than a person who feels they were put there. And the subtlety of the difference in that approach in the differences of those actions makes all the difference. And allows you to see, provide evidence, get results that reinforce the fact that, yes, I did use to be here, and this experience was wonderful. That's one of the reasons I chose to be here. I understand that I was just using the colloquialism of the general. I mean, I don't believe that, but I was trying to see your beliefs, your perspective of the general beliefs of how the Earth looks at that particular subject. Oh, I was also elected on a certain point, then one eventually decides that they would want, you know, on their playgrounds. Perhaps that is a more accurate way to put it. Once you play fully, you then find other places to play. That is far more the spirit of what I am discussing. Thank you. Come on, come on. Is that all? Yes. Pime. Hi there. Greetings there. Greetings. I want to say that I, in the last week, have experienced the light bulb going on and experienced myself as the greater, greater self of everything else. And this right here being the dream. Oh, it was a very empowering experience, and then everything you've said in the past just kind of made sense. Oh, that's all right. Did you, as you saw that this was, as you say, just the dream, understand and relish the dream? And if not, are you willing to go that next step? Well, it gave me a sense of, go, this is fun. I mean, this really can be fun. I can make this fun. Light and fun and, wow, you know. So that was, that was. Now that you know you can, will you? Can you be more definite about it? Can you decide to? And furthermore, settle for nothing less. This is the degree of commitment to the decision to empower yourself that I am discussing this evening. Yes, yes. I have crossed a definite line and decided that empowerment is mine to have. All right. You don't completely sound like you mean it. How would a person who made that decision sound make the statement as that person? I am empowered to create my life. How does that feel? It feels great. All right. Now. Are you going to display an action that is indicative of a trust in a different decision? No, I'm going to ask for some clarity. Oh, was that now a cleverly disguised butt? I know powers but. Oh. I'll let you get away with that one. You get a seat on clip. Thank you. Can you explain something about the empowerment of our breathing? Because I experienced I was way for weight doing energy balancing workshop. And that empowerment, I became extremely clear. And it was physiologically, I was clear in my body, clear in my mind. I was doing a lot of very intensive breath work. I would like to know what the connection really is if there is one. Is that the magic? You know, if I believe it is, it is. Well, more than that, it's a powerful symbol. The symbol of balance. What you call the balance of input, output, inflow, outflow, male, female. No matter what you wish to call it. What is the symbolic action of, shall I say, interacting with your environment whereby you exchange with the environment directly. Therefore, a very strong symbol of balance. Now, you can use this in whatever way your imagination provides. Perhaps when you wish in that sense to reassert your decision or to interpret a situation from the perspective of your new positive decision that you can first take what you refer to as several deep breaths to provide the symbol of balance. So that isn't a, that's one tool to use, but it's not necessary to even use that. It is up to you. If you find it pleasing, if you find it pertinent, if you find it potent, by all means use it. Any symbol that you attract, you can trust. If it feels good, do it. Okay. And now back to the dream stuff for a second. It's when I played with this knowing and felt the empowerment of being greater than myself in this moment in this reality. Then I said, okay, well so that means if it's really like a dream, then I could do anything I want. So, could I decide the idea? Could I decide the laws of physical laws on the planet Earth? Yes, you could. But would that serve your purposes in the moment to truly allow yourself to begin to walk your talk that you must assign? I was just wondering if that came up with the package. If you believe that, then nothing can talk you out of it. That would mean if you saw what you call evidence contrary to it, that would not talk you out of your decision. However, I again draw your attention, as similar to an earlier interaction, in exactly why you would want to do so, understanding the mass agreement, understanding that perhaps you chose to function generally within that agreement, are you doing so to express more your power, or are you proving something? Well, I guess for me it's an inner knowing that I have that anything is possible. But I guess I'm not firm enough in the knowing and I needed you to say yes it is possible. I don't need to do it. I just need to validate what I truly believe. Does that make sense? No, but I remind you that only you can validate, no matter what I say, and my particular, shall I say, contra-abusion is my opinion, so to speak. So with my dream, I can make anything up? Well, absolutely. What are your purposes? What are your definitions? And is that truly what you want, or is that a distraction? Oh, it's probably a distraction. But do you get the idea? Yeah, I do. It's very exciting. Oh, it always is if you choose to see it. The decision is life is exciting, and then whatever comes along you can interpret it as an exciting event, perhaps unexpected, perhaps contrary to what it is you actually thought was going to occur, but no less exciting. And maintaining the edge of that excitement allows you to fully, for us, pour into it, enjoy in love with excitement. So the maintaining of it is the key word. Maintaining your conscious awareness of who you are, what is going on in the moment according to who you are, and what your actions are. Those general free things. That is expanding your conscious awareness. All right? Thank you. Oh, thank you. You're welcome. Ma'el. Yes, ma'el. Hi. Recently I made some decisions and took some action, and in the process of trying to discover more of myself. And what I'd like to ask is the language of labels and how they create separation. For myself and my discovery of who I am, I've used the words like inner child, different ego states. And to me, by discovering those portions of myself, I consider that I was integrating by acknowledging those things. Well, that the effect, or did you find simply more portions to constantly deal with? Well, I think that you probably are speaking that I did find in a sense more portions to deal with, but there was an integration as a result of those portions. Is I labeled? Oh, I do you still see yourself as such a collection of parts for integration. Pre-assumes one whole whole being. I understand what you're saying. So, recognizing that obviously assigning these things, labels and portions has obviously created some disintegration. As I deal with them on an individual basis, my question to you is to format and reprogram my thinking to reintegrate those things. How would I go about doing that? Oh, thank you. First of all, acknowledge that you have learned much from this approach and display the gratitude or thankfulness that's such an elaborate process. This elaborate process has allowed you to address yourself in the many parts that up till now, individually and societally, you have all imagined yourselves to be. Also, then begin to realize that it all leads up to the point right now, where you no longer have the need to make such separation. That has served its purposes, that has in a sense lived its usefulness. And therefore, you are now one whole being. What you have referred to and named and labeled and elaborately dealt with as these parts are simply expressions of one whole being. Nothing needs to be dissected, dealt with specifically and healed because everything is one whole healthy being. The inner child needs not be separated to be inner. It can be the child that you express in the moment where that is appropriate, in the moment where that is useful. The child like quality is something that comes in handy. It is not sick, it is not ill, it no longer needs healing, it is well. Now allow it to express itself. What you call the ego is simply what you have assigned as the portion of yourself that allows you to maintain a focus as a physical being. It allows you to perceive yourself as the physical being. So it automatically does its job and needs no attention other than allowing you or continuing to allow yourself to see yourself as the physical being and fully be that physical being. Simply make the decision of who you are as one complete whole being, proceed as that being. Act, decide, trust and be as that one being. Is that too simple? No, it is not too simple. Oh, thank you. Again, when you heal portions of yourself, that is an assumption that they are ill or not well to begin with, aside from the assumption that they are portions of you to begin with. If you heal your inner child as many of you speak about doing, I assume the process of healing means it is healed. So why then would an individual need to keep healing the inner child if indeed healing means it is healed? So assume it is healed. Function as though it is healthy, assume that it is, your continued assumption that it needs healing is the other side of the coin of a continued assumption that it is still not well. Therefore it becomes a distraction more than an addition or an expression of yourself as a full being. Does that help? Yes, it does. Thank you. Fami, I have been figuring out how to ask this question because I need to ask about six questions to ask you exactly what I am trying to ask. What am I trying to ask? A unique question. I do not know. I think something like this, you always talk about what we could do in so many ways, how to explain our consciousness and everything. Is there anything being done from the other end like from our higher self end? I know the question is coming from the perspective of separativeness, but still is something being done from the other end. As long as you consider yourself as having so many ends, you can perhaps consider yourself to be assisting yourself from all directions. But ironically as you expand your awareness, you contract your perception of yourself to one whole being. So is that what you choose? Yes or no? The contracting? Do you choose to allow yourself to be assisted from all the aspects that you create? Oh yes. Hold on. Then it is the giving. You will not deny yourself something, but I do remind you as you have begin by saying that these are not ends or portions. This is you. I am aware of my totality and very fast as a fast, high speed and understanding my totality. But once in a while, many times I feel like it is something being done from some other end, my oversold form. Isn't that more active also at this time of our history? What you call your oversold, your higher self, is all knowing, all seeing, all inclusive, infinite. So it also contains the idea of allowing you to perceive yourself as separate and assisting yourself. In other words, is the cannot being waggled, is cannot widening between the physical self and the oversold. What you are creating as a seeming gap between yourself as a physical being and your oversold from my perception is narrowing. However, you can immediately bridge that gap and in fact understand there is no gap at all at any given moment. So you can create linear process. I am more of myself. I am closer to myself. I am almost there. All couple more steps. Or you can simply be yourself. And ultimately, if you are to play the game of taking steps and you stand right up face to face with yourself, understanding this is all quite colloquial. It still will take in a given moment the decision to just be yourself to take that final step. So you can have the aperancy of walking step by step or you can simply be. It is up to you. Okay. So reason then would I know more why I created certain situations or would I remember more? The 99.99 you talk about is it becoming 80 and 17? 70% precision. The pointed nature of physical consciousness. You will generally continue to exclude what you call 99% of your awareness to be able to focus in a physical way. Perhaps the point here is to realize that the point 1% that you know in any given moment is the point 1 that you need to know in that moment. And that there is nothing to strive or obtain. It is all right there whenever you need it. Maybe the whole questioning started because of that. There are so many situations in my life that I don't understand why I created them. One moment. Here is my suggestion. When you are identifying the purpose for something, allow it to be as obvious as possible. The most obvious reason that comes up in that moment is the reason in that moment. There need be no speculating. No analyzing. No speculation. Simply accept in that moment what comes to you. That is the action of trusting that you know what you need to know when you need to know it. Now that may change. You may say well this event that I thought brought me this is actually bringing me this. The reality is it brought you both. So allow it to be self-evident and obvious. As obvious as it will be in the moment. And then move on. Once you allow it to be obvious you go do the next thing. It is no longer an issue. Rather than continually thinking back upon it and literally recreating its effect in what you perceive as successive moments. Do you understand? Yes, I do. Is that helpful? Yes, it is. And very briefly it is from some other question but from your perspective is there any significance to Monday 12 December 12 12? My understanding of any significance that you are ascribing is simply a focusing of a portion of your mass consciousness that it is a significant date. It is simply a state of full being. However, when you speak of belief which is in a sense of filter through which you express your knowingness. Which you break down your knowingness into discrete parts to experience different aspects of your knowingness. When you are functioning by expressing a belief then you may say I know this to be true. I know that to be true. And that can simply semantically be a reflection of the expression of that belief. So as many words in your language there are different meanings. Does this clarify or has this made things more confusing? No, it clarifies it. So the knowingness basically the beliefs are within the knowingness. I mean we have knowingness, I know, and then within that we contain our beliefs. Again the breakdown that we speak of that will allow you to perhaps clarify this is as follows. Fundamentally your quality is you exist. Existence itself. Pure being. Reflection or expression within that beingness at its first separation from the pure what you call I is knowingness. I am a reflection, a separation. But still a knowingness of the totality of the total beingness. The next set of shall I say separation or breakdown that you then employ as physical finite being are through the pure beingness and pure knowingness. You express a particular approach, a particular point of view, a particular exploration if you will, called a belief which is perhaps if you consider as an analogy only the beingness to be pure unadulterated white life. The knowingness to be what you call the rainbow though the spectrum of that rainbow is infinite, not the mere spectrum of what you refer to as seven colors. And then the belief being the filtration of one of those colors to experience it fully in and of itself separate from the other colors of the rainbow that would provide an analogy. Does that clarify? Yes, that's excellent. Thank you. Now all the colors have completely equal quality, equality. But they can be explored separately so that their unique aspects can be fully relished at the exclusion of all other colors. So all beliefs are completely valid, have complete equality, and therefore also do you have equal ability to express any of them because of that equality? So that's where I get to choose. And you do not have one belief, one color of the rainbow, and not have another belief, another color of the rainbow, have to get rid of one color and get another. You have both colors, you express one color, and the form ultimately in a physical sense that shows you which color you are expressing most fully are your actions. But you can also look at your emotions and your thoughts to get a sense of which color or which belief you are expressing in that moment knowing full well that you contain all the other beliefs or all the other colors. Thank you very much. Oh, thank you for being so colorful. Thank you very much. Can you tell me something about my father? I am missing some information. What can you tell me? He died. Hey, that I understand. What else? I really think I would like to know right now. My perception, understanding that this is not my usual job, is that he is what you would call non-physical at this time in that sense in preparation for what you call another incarnation. That is my sense. Now what does that mean to you? Oh, that is what I have to offer on that. Is there something else you wish to ask? I am currently aboard what you would perhaps refer to as my craft or bidding my home planet. Upon my planet there are none. Therefore we do not have what you generally refer to as time. So there are some gravitic fluctuations in what you refer to as our water body. All right, interesting. Thank you. There will be but a few more sharing. Male. Last session, actually when Tony was eating the sandwich, you were speaking about the society, the group people who were transparent, eat rocks. Well, in a sense, more transparent than you know yourselves to be. Well, in the progression of linear time, whatever, isn't that the native articulate? No. Well, what about their history of that? Well, what about? Is that true? I mean, didn't make a process through that because they were underground. The question is not clear. From what I described, I will simply say that our different races all together. Right. Now I just found it interesting because I didn't know that that was meant for a reason. I said that to introduce a new society that we have not discussed before and also make a point about the idea of interacting with your external environment in the assumption that you need something from it and do not contain everything yourself. And there are varying degrees to which physical beings will express this relationship. That relationship would be perhaps what you could say slightly less removed but still a separation. Okay. Thank you. Other man. In that age, this is about Jesus. Did he perform so-called miracles such as healing the lame, making the blind see? He performed a demonstration of the power within each individual by allowing those individuals to focus and shift their own belief system to create their own results. And your society has misplaced the power that was displayed in those circumstances to him rather than the individuals and their what you refer to in your biblical sense as faith. Which is what did the healing? Okay. But what sometimes referred to as the father within can simply represent your power to create your reality. Those individuals healed themselves. They utilized an external symbol but it was ultimately the shifting of their own belief. Okay. How about those that turn stones into loaves and multiplying fishes and coming the stomie waters? What I will say is that there is some truth and some exaggeration to this but I will say no more and allow you to explore what that means to you. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Shitting over there. Hey. Is there any connection between your own society, the society as being the future self of the potential mutation between the data reticulum and human races? Well you already know this to be some. That is the case. Do you have a vested interest in perhaps the potential future that you would like to see here on earth or is your potential future protected as one of many infinite possibilities regardless of what takes place in the next? Well in a sense both. But vested interest only in the sense to watch in many different what you would call probable reality streams what occurs with the full allowance to allow all decisions to be made and simply be fascinated in them. I already from my perspective I leave it up to your own sense of discernment to decide for yourself but from my own perspective I already exist and the historic events that would result in my existence have already occurred in my time stream. Oh thank you. Hey. Interesting dream. Oh wow. You have an interesting dream. Do share. I've had a lot of interesting dreams. Do you have allowed what you call your dreams to function as the more direct and obvious reflection than many individuals through the decision to allow them to play that role? So therefore you get what you decided. Do proceed. So the dream was that I had these outdated tools and I brought them to this building that had all these bins with these same tools and they were and I took my tools and just put them in the bins that really didn't need them anywhere at all and the function of those tools we don't use anymore. Everything's new and that was the dream. Oh how creative. So the next day I find out the kind of business that I've been doing something that says hey you can't do it anymore. You can't take a contract on top of a contract. That's the way we always did it. That's the old tools. So I can't use them anymore. So the interesting thing is that the dream came before it happens. Well this happens often for individuals that will choose to recognize it in a sense it is a form of what you generally refer to as pre-cognition. So that's what's going on with me. Pre-cognition. Sometime. Other times it didn't. They most definitely happened on. Repeat the question. So why can't I pre-cognition. The lottery number. You tell me. Oh, of course. Why a guy. You understand that that is not out of the question. But why do you want the money? Does the money express something that you feel you cannot do without the money? If you assume that you create your own reality and you are not creating that form of what you call cold cash, then you can assume as well, not that you cannot continue to play with the symbol and hope you win, that you have another plan in mind. Another valid way to accomplish the things you designed. And again, playing the game for the excitement of the game is far different than playing for the expectation of the winning. Sledding. Hey, it's too many. Does all of us in this room have their attracted to you and the SSani energy? Does this possibly include the small here in this room and have future lives on SSani? The interesting thing about linear time is you get to decide back. Thank you. Oh, thank you. See you around. At this timing, allow me to thank you all for your willingness to share with me. The notion of conscious awareness and expanding into being more of yourself. I remind you that all that you need to do in order to remain conscious is to decide to remain conscious. Trust that you are remaining conscious and display the action of remaining conscious. Again, to caps alive, since you all seem to like that. Conscious awareness of who you are, step one, I am this person. That is your decision. Step two, what is going on? Conscious awareness of your surroundings in light of step one, in light of the fact of who you decided to be, and no other point of view. I am this person and this is happening to me as this person. And step three, conscious awareness of what you will then do as that person. To place the order and maintain the resolve and maintain the reality of that person. Then you will consciously be aware of who you are, act that way, and the entire reality will reinforce who you are because it can do nothing else. That is already what it is doing flawlessly. And when you vacillate in your decision, your reality vacillates. When you maintain your resolve, your reality may smooth out, but it will be no less fascinating, no less exciting. And no less surprising. I thank you and I bid you all a most fond and loving. Good day. Peace.
