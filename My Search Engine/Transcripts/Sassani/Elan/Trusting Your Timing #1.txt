 All right, I'll say, greeting and welcome this evening of your time as you create time to exist. How are you all? Oh, thank you very much. Apparently, alive and well and perfect, believe me. Allow me to begin with the entitlement, trusting your timing, interesting and perhaps apropos for what many of you are choosing to experience in your reality at this time. Allow me to begin by simply reminding you all that you do in fact create your life and one step further, you do in fact create your own reality. Perhaps this has become a catchphrase in your society. However, it is quite accurate for it is in that sense one experience that you can choose to explore consciously rather than half consciously and unconsciously altogether. For creating you do regardless of whether you choose to take the responsibility to do so consciously or not. So perhaps if you will say, if I created my own reality, why would I have created this life, then you may understand that by and far your creations have stemmed from your unconscious creation and what we are beginning to share with you is the willingness to become conscious, the willingness to take back the power and responsibility of creating your reality, but perhaps according to preference and integrity for these are ideas that allow you to express who you are in no uncertain terms. So allow us to again remind you that you always trust in something. Trust is the expression of a belief akin to the idea you refer to as faith. So trust is not something in that sense that you need to build up muster up for when you are saying that you are not having faith or not trusting in something. What is actually occurring is you are having faith or are trusting in the complete opposite. Always do you trust in something and therefore simply identifying where you have placed your trust allows you to see whether or not that is where you wish to place it and simply shifting that trust according to preference can be quite simple. Understand what you call your reality. Exist within what you call a time frame. You sometimes speak about being a soul or having a soul, however being a soul is more accurate. For a soul is not something within you a soul is what you are within so to speak. A soul does not reside in your body. You can experience that a parent. But more accurately your body resides within your soul. Your soul or your essence or your higher self or whatever you wish to call it is an infinite multi dimensional and eternal expression. Therefore it is timeless. It is ageless. It is faithless in its pristine form. What you call time what you call faith exists within the infinity of your soul or of your higher self. So time and timing is an expression that exists within your soul which is a timeless creation. Now why would you do this? Good question. Being that you are an infinite being you explore an infinite number of possibilities. One of those possibilities which may express in a multiple of ways is to express yourself as a finite being. Finite can be defined as perhaps in your terminology having a beginning, middle and end, so to speak it is a seeming progression, a seeming beginning with so called nothing, acquiring knowledge, acquiring experience and so to speak ending up larger than you in that sense began. But since you are infinite this is only one minute expression within your totality. It is only one choice. When you make that choice you choose to experience your infinity in a line, in a linear fashion seemingly one thing at a time unfolding. And this is what you refer to as your time phrase. When you create space you are creating a finite idea within the infinity of your being. And in order to move across so to speak space you create time in order to do so. This is why even your scientists are understanding that rather than space and time being two things they now refer to space time as two sides of one coin. Therefore when you experience in the infinity space which is finite you then create time in which to again move through it, move across it. One other idea when you are in your natural state an infinite eternal multi-dimensional all knowing being there is actually a certain idea that you cannot experience when you know it all already there is not the idea within that all knowingness of discovery, of experiencing things as if for the first time which by the way many of you say you like. And also the idea you call surprise how can anything surprise you if you always know it is coming. So one of the fundamental reasons to create a linear frame of reference is to experience things as if in that sense you begin as a blank slate. And then by elaborately playing an amnesia so to speak on your all knowingness can then seem to experiencing with the joy of discovery with the apparently of the first time even in your vernacular even in your planetary society. You enjoy not knowing what is going to occur when you go to say your movie. So in that sense you have the joy of seeing how it will play out from the multiplicity of possibility you will see how one particular version will play out and enjoy being surprised by it. This is one shall I say micro-cognic analogy to your entire life the idea of unfolding as if you are actually experiencing things for the first time. Now many of you do this as a curse but you may also understand now that I have mentioned it now that you are entertaining the notion that you have chosen on some level to do this that that seeming amnesia only exists from where you are sitting from your standpoint right now from the perspective of your higher self your soul your over soul whatever you wish to call it. You already know what you are doing you already are playing out a set of choices so to speak that you have laid down so nothing occurs that is outside of your consciousness outside of your being your consciousness is your infinite knowingness what you refer to on your planet as your mentality is your finite version of knowing. So you experience your mentality as an unfoldment and from this perspective it seems quite real it seems like this is the only reality this is the only many times individuals will say planet with intelligent life not true and you may understand that that is a very narrow point of view by excluding 99.9999 so on and so forth percent of reality you focus in on a very fine fractionated portion of your totality you may feel that seeing thinking hearing smelling feeling one thing at a time is the normal mode of operation but from your higher self perspective it is a unique experience for your higher self has the ability to understand an infinite number of things at once so therefore one thing at a time is actually the exception rather than the rule how you set up your reality here so to speak is by seeming as though one thing at a time is the rule and playing that sense that fine ability to focus down to one thing at a time these are all built into the reasoning of your higher self for experiencing this type of reality now the sense of amnesia that you impose upon yourself is so pervasive is so all inclusive that you have conveniently perhaps some of you will experience that inconveniently forgotten even why you're here but obviously you are now beginning to allow yourself to attract the resources through whatever you read whatever you find yourself attracted to interacts and such as this to remind yourself through reflections through a mirror I am only a mirror within your own consciousness that these other ideas are so effectively beginning to lift your amnesia again along a timeline and unfoldment a bit at a time your timing is always impeccable impeccable it cannot be otherwise it is always that where you are right here right now the only place and time you ever experience is always the most perfect place in the entirety of your being I believe this is another little minor fact you may have forgotten therefore you will often create your reality as going somewhere a whole lot better than right here which is in a sense only an idea for you are the one who has determined that right here and right now is not the perfect place and time when you assign that meaning needless to say you get that effect and constantly are you going somewhere never quite being where you are where you are is always unique where you are always has advantages that any other place you seem to go and I am seeking in your own linear terms will not contain so every here and now has a unique advantage and your willingness to simply remind yourself of this is perhaps one of the first steps to beginning to see or beginning to allow yourself to examine what is right in front of your face always does the moment contain a unique advantage remember that unless you choose to forget when I say you are always trusting in something I mean for trust is one of the mechanisms that your mentality utilizes to hold your reality in place so if you trust or if you do not trust for instance in the statement I get what I want one way to look at it is that you don't have faith or trust that you get what you want but perhaps another more efficacious or more advantageous way to look at it is that you are trusting that you do not get what you want so it is not a matter of building a trust that you do get what you want it is a matter of identifying and acknowledging where you are already placing your trust which in general there is some under or over tone in many individuals that you get what you are dealt however that is not the only way to look at it when you look at anything from a particular trust level you experience the results of that trust you always get the evidence for whatever you are trusting in and trusting in I do not get what I want again perhaps some of you will be familiar with some of the results of that type of trust rather than once again building up through processes and exercise and mental strain trust that you do get what you want first acknowledge where your trust is allow me to say from my experience which in no way is in any way shape or form better than your own simply different that I know that I get what I want therefore I get what I want I know that I will get it if I continue to want it and I know something else I know that I will not get it one moment sooner than I can handle it and explore it fully I also know I will not get it one moment later how refreshing the idea is this timing can be used to your own advantage when you quote unquote begin to sense that you desire or want something obviously it is either available in that moment that you are thinking and pondering it or it is not plain and simple I think you will agree with me on that one if it is available obviously it is simply a matter of doing that thing and reaping that result if it is not available you get a choice you can use the fact that it's not available as evidence that it never will be and give up or you can understand that the fact that it's not available means even though you may think you are ready for it obviously through the feedback of your reality the universe is telling you you may think you are ready for it but you can enjoy and explore it far more favorably and fully when first you attract along your linear timeline certain other ideas certain knowledge which may then allow you to experience and enjoy that thing more fully certain resources that will allow you to attract and live out that reality more fully so the first thing in beginning to express getting what you want is trusting the timing understanding that you choose to trust that you do get what you want trusting the timing goes something like this ah I am very excited about this particular thing is it available yes or no yes I do it no well I'm still excited about it but it's not available continuing to obsess on that point when it is not available actually distracts you from something else what is that something else the unique advantage available in this moment if you are using or experiencing this moment to wish that you are at that moment you are doing so at the cost of what is right in front of you if you are willing to remind yourself I now choose to express that I get what I want and this is not available and I still want it you can push it aside push it out of your view maintaining it as a clear intention I intend to do this whenever it comes up no matter what but once you push it aside with the assurance of that intention you then remove the obstruction that you place in your vision of what is right in front of you the unique advantage of the moment you are within now needless to say this is an approach it is a viewpoint it is no better it is not superior than any other viewpoint you have taken but it is however as simple as any other viewpoint you have taken for it is simply a matter of not being willing to settle for anything less than what you deserve and you deserve what you desire when you push aside your clear intention because it is not available there is a very interesting methodology that you can follow to actually get to that thing more quickly and that is again by pushing it aside and seeing what's there using your excitement using your passion from what is there and choosing the option that is there that excites you the most that you can act upon with your integrity now that option may seem to have absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with that desire that wants that clear intention but the fact that you desire it more than anything else that's available the fact that it excites you more than anything else that is available and the fact that that clear intention excites you means they have the excitement in common and the excitement that you express is your particular unique expression of who you are from what's available so the fact that something excites you in a given moment though it may situation only seem to have nothing to do with that clear intention that is not available in that moment tells you in no uncertain term it is related to that clear intention therefore when you ground yourself to the moment when you explore and allow yourself by pushing away everything that's not available to explore what is available you begin to use the unique advantages that each moment has to offer and the only thing that you are doing is choosing to view your reality from this perspective and doing that thing if you are acting upon what excites you with integrity then you cannot in the process harm anyone else harm yourself for integrity and I do not mean this from your general moral term integrity which is quite subjective and quite variable from group group upon your planet I mean integrity as it stems from the word integrated whole remember you are an infinite being seeming or choosing to seem to exist within a reality but again as I have said and will now expand upon the reality exists within you the paradox is that it exists within each and every one of you and though it would seem like this could not be possible now you are getting the idea of an infinite concept where each one of you will experience that all of reality exists within them including all the others in the room including the entire planet but this seeming inconsistency again is more of an infinite concept however again you can use it by understanding that the reality exists within you you can understand that anything within the reality is part of one integrated whole and everything that you interact with is a reflection within the integrated whole of your consciousness telling you something about yourself about what you are choosing from the finite point of view to explore so therefore I assume if you will recognize the integration of all reality that your actions will reflect the respect that anything that you are interacting with is not separate from you but is part of you so integrity is simply acting according to that respect for everything within you the respect for your agreement the respect in that sense for the interactions that you choose to co-create with other individuals one other way to look at integrity well is this particular option can I act upon it with integrity is to again super impose any individuals that you are dealing with upon yourself perhaps going something like well if that were me would I like it if someone did that or interacted with me in that way perhaps one of your phraseologies upon your planet to simplify this is doing unto others as you would have them do unto you following that simple guidelines always expresses your integrity for it always treats everything within you everyone within you every situation within you as though it is you and you treat yourself and every aspect of yourself with that same respect so if you are able to act upon an exciting exciting prospect with integrity no harm done for when you are treating your reality with the respect it deserves and you are honoring the expression of your excitement which is the expression once again of who you are why does something excite you you in particular everyone is excited about something slightly different some people may overlap and share exciting notions but each excitement expression is unique because that is the unique indication that your reality gives you that from what's available this option is most mean that is what excitement is it is the vibration the compass the barometer that tells you this is me now if this is me and you can act upon it with integrity do so if this particular option is most exciting but perhaps in the situation doing that at this time would obviously not be within your integrity push that aside do not fixate or obsess upon that the criteria is excitement but it is excitement with integrity now again if you cannot act upon a particular option with integrity push that aside perhaps in the same space as your clear intention but move it out of the way because if you cannot act upon it with integrity it is not an option for you and when you push it aside rather than keep it there you move it out of your way and allow yourself to see what may be just right behind it again another unique option a unique advantage in a given moment so if you can act upon it with integrity do so if not push it aside see what's still right in front of your face choose the thing that excites you the most from what is available and act upon that with integrity if again that is an option doing this and maintaining your desire if you wish to call it your clear intention the thing that you want is all that it takes to continue to be who you are to interact with your reality with integrity and to finally experience the thing you say you want but when you are in a moment where the thing that you want is an option because you have gone through many of these other experiences you are now more equipped to explore that exciting thing most fully after you establish that exciting thing as a clear intention the timing the lack of it being in a moment once again allows you to begin to accumulate through experience resources and knowledge that will enable you no matter what you say right now to enjoy that thing more fully than you can even imagine you can enjoy it right now all this is a matter of taking the trust that many of you place in the fact that things never work out and life is random to the empowering point of view that you get what you want perhaps at first not when you think you want it but if you still want it and get it what's the difference and if you begin not to want it and don't get it what's the difference the point is generally you will find you will maintain that desire that excitement and you will through a series of astounding coincidences things coming from all different directions you never expected attract resources individual timing knowledge equipment that will then place you in a moment where that thing that you have said you desire is one of the options that you can act upon with integrity this in a nutshell is trusting your timing and each time that you do not take this approach you are trusting that there is no timing that you do not get what you want and therefore you get the evidence or the effect of there being no seeming intelligence to the timing and that you do not get what you want except once in a while when you get lucky but understand you can experience what i am saying and obviously seeing what's right in front of your face concentrating your attention in what's right there choosing with your excitement the most exciting thing acting upon it with integrity is no big deal as you say it is simple it is fun it is effortless acting upon the things that excite you with integrity takes no effort produces no struggle therefore if it is available now's the time as you say go for it if it is not you still get what you want allow that to roll around in your mentality allow this approach to be sampled by you if you so desire obviously the way that you create your own reality right now is flawless for your reality is ongoing you experience it however perhaps the idea of consciously creating your life of creating according to preference may just appeal to you i don't know maybe it will but what we have found in our society what we have found from our experience is that we will settle for nothing less and the mechanism is flawless when you follow your excitement with integrity in the moment what's available right here right now you begin to create new effects as you act upon something that excites you there is a result that result puts a new thing into the options that wouldn't have been there before and so something that excites you in this moment so it may seem to have nothing to do with the most exciting thing is by definition a stepping stone that literally creates the next stone and so on and so forth everything is related one integrated whole this is you this is your reality this is one option of how you can live your life when you do so you begin to experience your life in an effortless way you begin to experience what you call ecstasy for everything is an effortless conscious creation when you do so not only do you change your life changes and miraculously so does everyone around you seem to change your new approach by the way comes becomes quite contagious individual seeing another individual living in this way validating themselves using and choosing from their excitement get attracted to this idea because they see that it works as well as the disempowering notions you are already in that sense implementing it all works it is simply a matter of choosing which ones you want you get what you want one thing that we sometimes share with you is the ultimate truth or the ultimate truth what is the ultimate truth they want please tell me all right i will the ultimate truth to ultimately be the truth leads nothing out the ultimate truth must now listen up if you choose to sleep wake up now the ultimate truth must be composed of all truths leave one out and it is almost the ultimate truth therefore all truths must exist within the ultimate truth what this means is that all truths all beliefs all approaches are valid now obviously being a being that chooses one thing at a time you cannot choose all truths and some truths may actually seem to contradict one another but that does not make one right and one wrong that makes both the truth for the individuals expressing and exploring that truth you're willing it to begin to get a feel of the fact that all truths are true for the individual choosing to create them take the burden off your shoulder of having to convert everyone over to your truth and believe me your neck and shoulders will feel better when you remove that weight from yourself the bottom line is it is in a sense a futile effort to assume that your truth is the only truth and that's it for then you miss out on all the other options one other way to look at this is that my truth is a truth it is the truth that I am choosing to explore I have my reasoning for exploring this truth certainly I have my right to explore any truth I wish why not consider affording that attitude to everyone else's truth well their truth may be an odd with my truth but they have their own reason and because I wish to express that I have the right to express my truth well obviously even though their truth may look misguided to my truth they have the right to explore that truth as well simply removing the notion that a truth is the only way and replacing it with the notion that a truth is a way can begin to lubricate the friction that individuals create upon your planet in interacting with each other you can validate everyone else's truth and can even do so without condoning it condoning someone's truth by the way is not validating it is not saying well you have the right and reason to believe that condoning someone else's truth is you acting according to their truth well I'll show them how that feels you are being them when you show them that you are expressing their truth and proving to them that their truth absolutely works as well all truths are valid all truths work all belief systems are complete packages and they carry with them their own set of evidence their own set of results even if they seem completely opposite so beginning to expand your version of the ultimate truth to include all other truths can even allow you to come face to face with an individual saying their way is the only way and still allowing their way to be valid even though you choose to act according to your way in other words their truth may not encompass yours but yours can always continue to encompass theirs and this beginning on any individual level is all it takes to begin to expand out level by level person by person upon your planet the bulk of struggle and conflict that occurs upon your planet is when an ideology or philosophy builds into its doctrines this is the only way and anything else stinks get out of here that is only one perspective obviously then they do not allow themselves to have as many options to choose from when you simply allow that to be converted to the statement that this is a truth a very valid truth it works if you are attracted to it come here i will share it with you if not go along your way you will find your own truth if everyone upon your planet were to tomorrow embrace this idea what you call war would see and what you would begin to understand as we have understood as a society is that there can actually be strength and unity in diversity and the truth that insists that all other truths have no right to be there will generally create reality whereby they will in some way eradicate their existence in your reality for that becomes inconsistent with your expression negative individuals who will choose to explore negativity will always get the results of their negativity but that is none of your concern your business so to speak for your business and concern is your truth in terms of expressing it but willingness to embrace all possibility allows you to live as an expanded being rather than a contracted one in almost every instance if not every instance were you to at least assume for a moment that some particular truth which seems to be quite quite bigoted quite disempowering for one moment you could simply imagine how one might feel that way you will see perhaps just a glimmer that you can picture how someone would be that way therefore that gives you the compassion to understand that though you may not choose to be that way they have the right and reason and by showing them you reinforce their reality by maintaining who you are allowing them to be who they are but not condoning their actions by expressing who you are you show them another possibility when you give someone back what they're giving you reinforce their reality when you show them the alternative you give them another choice it is not your business to decide whether or not they will take that choice but often you will find individuals do not really wish to remain disempowered do not really wish to think that reality is crumbling all around them do not really wish to think they are unloved and judged from without and from within the only way you can even even come close to being able to provide to a disempowered individual any sense of service is by expressing your own empowerment that shows them at least it's possible here's a living example now again that is not your job that will simply be an automatic result compassion need not be sympathy compassion can be your honoring of their power of their ability to create of their ability when creating a circumstance to handle the results of that circumstance if you can assist by all means do but if you cannot at least acknowledge and respect their sovereignty their creatorhood perhaps again they are creating from a disempowered perspective but they are just as flawlessly creating you are perfect create for perfect therefore when you choose misery and strife you create perfect misery and strife but that is no less a perfect creation it may be to you a less preferred creation and that's why you can change your perspective you cannot be responsible for anyone else only to them by being willing to be responsible for yourself in expressing who you are which brings me back once again to your excitement and your trust in your timing if something is not available you always have the choice to say well since it's not available i don't get it i never get what i want and so on and so forth or you have the ability to say ah i thought that i was really ready for this but apparently i am only ready to begin to look at this irony and boy am i now very excited because if i will even enjoy this more than i am imagining i'll wait if you assume if you simply take the perspective that you get what you want and that is a given then let it go if you know you're going to get the thing that you want what else is there left to do but enjoy yourself from now to then you definitely get it that is one way one truth one perspective that you can if you wish embrace therefore timing is impeccable timing is flawless you have an expression oh here is an idea who has come before it's time no the mere statement of that idea tells you it is time and becomeversely the mere unavailability tells you it's not time you get what you want if you allow yourself to assume and insist that this is because you create in an unfolding manner you do not allow yourself perfectly i may add to see how everything will play out if you did you lose the discovery you lose the surprise you lose the everyone knows the first time is the best time by the way that is not necessarily true but i understand the perspective the first time is uniquely one experience and then any other time you do it is actually again the first time however with a little bit of knowledge so you can also look at it that way i thank you for your willingness to attract yourself through this interaction for it is no less an expression of your timing it is no accident that you are here in the timing that you are and those of you who are interacting and creating and co-creating this interaction with me in other formats what you call your taste format and so forth your timing is just as on if you are not physically able to be here trust your timing you will see perhaps why by the way before i begin to open up most of the time you will see why the timing was so once in a while you will not big deal that is part of the discovery and the surprise you know what you need to know when you need to know it if you simply acknowledge that i therefore thank you for sharing this timing with me for co-creating this interaction in a timing whereby we can co-create co-create an interaction of this nature in return for your willingness to create this timing with me i ask you now how we may mutually be of service to each other sharing hey i have to thank you for anything you said it was wonderful will i thank you for saying it through me allowing me to mirror it back to you for you can only only experience something if you first contain it otherwise there's no sense to be repeat the question i just i also want to thank you for the interaction that we had it has been monumental in helping me with some transitions and um it's just been incredible allow me before you proceed to remind you that it has been as monumental for me i have just as much to learn from each and every one of you i know you are an extension of me i know from my perspective you exist within me and therefore the more aware i become of you the more i know of myself i thank you for this gift now to get to what you're talking about tonight one part of it that i have i'm having difficulty understanding it or putting it to action is when something excites me and there are lots of things that are exciting in these days one can you all hear this individual please speak up be bold so that all may share you'll get uh there are many things that are exciting me that coming into my life that are very exciting oh one and my difficulty seems to be i feel the excitement and then fear steps in and so i'm trying to understand where the doing it was in with integrity and fear it's getting confused it feels right it feels great but then uh oh i'm scared oh can you phrase since fear in general is a belief a trust that's something that you do not prefer will be most likely can you define more pointedly what you fear in other words just to reiterate for those unable to hear this individual will sometimes see an option that is quite exciting and have a fear emotion toward the moving in that direction what is the nature of the fear what do you believe could happen that you do not prefer by expressing who you are well i i'll fail oh how is that possible what has failed you uh is fail you're not having the result that you wish yes oh why is that failure because as we have said if the result is not a result that you wish but you still want that result you still get it and obviously timing is coming into play would you repeat that if you are fearing that you will enacting upon an exciting thing not get the result but you understand that if you do not get the result you still want the result and can push you to side as a clear intention and move forth how can you ever really fail unless you sell out the intention or the design well it's not the failure let's say it's the experience of feeling foolish in the moment so who who is watching you how can you feel foolish to yourself are you judging yourself yes why i feel comfortable i i know i assume that is not true i assume you are speaking to me about it because it is quite uncomfortable i'm not well i'm getting somewhere with you what is judgment to you what is self-judgment not allow me to answer the question okay not unconditionally loving yourself if you unconditionally love yourself if you entertain the notion of removing any conditions and just insisting i love myself no matter what then judgment does not come into play judgment is the imposition of a set of conditions which when you then do not meet you judge yourself to somehow be less because you have not met conditions but the only one weighing down the conditions is you so therefore simply restating that i am simply unwilling to not love myself no matter what can remove this mechanism and can allow you to see this excite school i deserve this i'm going to do this i can act upon it with integrity no matter what the outcome then you will begin to see that you will step and do something have a result and there will be no judgment because whether or not that result is what you expect it will be a pleasant advantageous result you are utilizing conditional self-love as a form of self paralysis remove the conditions insist you will love yourself no matter what and simply take what is sometimes referred to and perhaps is now the timing as that leap of trust that leap of faith all right i'm going to do this because i know it's who i am and if it doesn't turn out the way i expect will i know i still love myself so therefore then take the step perhaps one of the hinges in which much of what we share with you comes into play is simply being willing to shake that body so to speak to move in action through your reality and see what happens does that shift your orientation slightly oh yeah well it often shows me what i need to look at no no it shows you what you may wish to look at but you don't need anything you have everything you could possibly need in any given moment you always know what you need to know when you need to know it now you get the joy to discover removing the last conditions you have placed upon yourself you have earned your self love all of you do not settle for anything less what you call god what we call all that is is unconditionally loving so any of your literature or any of your perspectives that speaks of god judging is creating god in the image of man slash for man for unconditional love cannot judge by definition judgment is the is the imposition of conditions which then when not next withdrawal of love all that is does not do that it is not even an option within all that is however you each and every one of you are the only ones with that option no matter what you think of yourself all that is will love you unconditionally so there is no outside judging you on the inside you are the outside everything is within you and you are the only judge or you are the only bequeter of forgiveness therefore this is where your literature in our particular opinion gets a little bit filtered or altered from its original intent judgment judgment is not a quality of god judgment is one of the options within the human experience unconditional love is the quality of all that is does that help wonderful yes oh thank you then I thank you as well shut it hey man thank you you over there oh hi how you doing oh what perfect ads are you I have a question if the soul is is all knowing before we came into embodiment what is it we're trying to arrive at or why did we come into bottom in if we already had this all knowing this the screen because whatever existence does not forbid it demands because just because because it is an option because it is an experience because it is one way that your infinite consciousness can express itself and no other reason many individuals will buy into the growth of your soul but as I have shared your soul already contains everything where is it going to grow how does infinite get any bigger the idea is within that infinity there are options of experience this being again a very unique option when you come quote unquote down you forget it but I am reminding you therefore need not be any more mysterious than just because it is there and as I have said more specifically so that you can experience discovery this experience learning experience surprise does that make sense oh yes what is this about if you as you grow you get closer to the gods the one the one that all that is that is a man a human made perspective for understand you are all that is there is no separation all that is and the reason we prefer to call it all that is is because it is all that is it leaves nothing out so what you explore one of the ways you explore finite reality is to impose again a sense of annesia that actually allows you and this is the exception not the rule to temporarily seem to forget that you are already connected to all that is or gone and when you begin to express that connection the first thing that comes along with that knowing this is that you were never disconnected it was impossible to be disconnected and you do not need any external expression to express the connection that you can never be disconnected from it is simply a matter of acknowledgement and rather than seeing if you are connected to all that is you simply begin to explore how you are connected does that answer the question oh yes thank you my hey hey and do you it's actually my honor my honor to stick to you again what mine as well and i'll sort of be in a room of your faces myself it's happy to see that people listening to these ideas oh all right also allow your gift to be shared project that voice of yours right thank you sound like you mean it thank you um i didn't have i have one question that this came to mind it has to do with more of a physical i guess it's trying to be questioned about our planets and our galaxy well they align well great fashion that is completely arbitrary from where you are viewing from one perspective they are always aligned from some point of view in perhaps the way that you mean of the direct linear alignment from your central star no oh that's my eye i came up that we're in this somebody told me that well again there are different definitions of alignment and there is always a type of interrelationship alignment so a particular expression of alignment there is but straight across the board no okay what does it matter i i was thinking about it because as far as time before you proceed it does matter because you care about it do not minimize what you are exploring it is quite a tiny well are you perhaps getting to the fact of explaining some of your seismological events well that was definitely a question i'm sure somebody else i don't know the idea is what you are now experienced upon your planet as seismological phenomena are not quite caused by that particular type of alignment it is more shall i say an equalization of certain energies and pressures within your planet itself that may have some relationships to the gravimetric fields of other planets but is more directly related to your own planet and most directly related to the transforming consciousness both individually and on mass upon your planet i i feel as far as timing and trusting and timing is what we're talking about here tonight and that's very important to me and i i picked that up a lot as far as physical aspect you know they're going on and i include our little university or a little galaxy and that kid that was a good interest in it oh other than that um last time i was in a group this group with you um i i had a trust in timing quite fit so you will find when a subject comes up you create a multiplicity of opportunities and circumstances to really prove it to yourself yeah so here i am and i'm still here and i definitely still trust in the timing of some of my intentions i've done a lot of work on this and i've had a lot of fun doing it and i'm very intent that and i know that i will get what i want that is all it takes right now are you now in this moment here and now the only place and time allowing yourself to glean the unique advantage of this moment then simply continue to do so you're on a roll right i'm i'm really just enjoying life i'm amazed at the synchronicity of things well as you begin to acknowledge the synchronicity it will amaze you or again it takes into consideration the infinite universal knowledge which may seem baffling to the finite point of view but you can revel in it and your willingness again to acknowledge the synchronicity to acknowledge the perfection of the timing then amplifies your experience of that amazing set of circumstances and coincidences so acknowledging synchronicity being aware of synchronicity continues to bring to your awareness more synchronicity do i have two more questions oh thank you for answering your own questions nice it's wonderful to touch base with you in this style again all right base all right we do not have a base in your quadrant but i understand what you do but you on your scale tracks are there anyone else with you no you want a projection table you would consider that i am again lying in a state of repose upon a particular table that you might refer to as a projection table yes i'm enjoying a abundance of synchronous timing oh thank you i'm learning to allow everything and everyone i'm learning to allow everything and everyone will like to get you sometimes it's not because you're dollars but well it will be but you're truffed again particularly in the timing and then seeing that you get what you want perhaps begins to make it feel again more and more effortless then take it it's yours and it's free you can all have it i was wondering if a man named dpok shop dpok chokla he's becoming extremely popular and a lot of people are listening to him and he's helping a lot of people my husband is listening to him so i hear what my husband's listening to and um you are referring to a particular individual upon your planet that is referred to in the term of medical doctor that is beginning to entertain shall i say a more expanded point of view of the role and nature of your consciousness and again in a very literal sense acknowledging that your body even your physical body exists within your consciousness and not the other way around this particular individual in assuming that particular shall i say title or role get the degree of respect from individuals again in your society that may not be willing to embrace extraterrestrials and other dimensional beings and what you call individuals from the spirit realm and therefore provides the service of being a buffer and allowing much of this information very similar to the information that we share to be more acceptable by many other members of your society so he represents a gradient expression now again once that individuals in your society are willing and eager and curious to begin to entertain the degree of your personal power my question was as i listened to him i know he is expanding people from in this place but at the same time he falls short of your uh one moment at the same time his truth is from a different perspective now is there a particular aspect of his truth that you wish to discuss from my perspective you know i feel that his his truth is perfect by the way for the individuals that attract it flawless yes i see that but his truth is what the fan is in here and my question is not really but proceed i'll let you get away with it my question is when will larger numbers of people be willing to accept your version this is what i mean by gradient expression one thing at a time begin to accept the fact that perhaps just perhaps you can walk and you will begin to desire to run it is perhaps you can say in that sense automatic it is a perfect expression for the individuals that attract it that are simply not ready or willing to hear anything else and therefore again when individuals begin to embrace an expanded point of view from where they seem to be exploring they get hungry but it is not necessary that anyone embraced our point of view it is only something that if you choose to experience you can live you can do and you will attract individuals many of them who may seems to now be ready to expand a bit more from any particular truth and you can facilitate them to do so that is all but first and foremost by validating the other truth the other reality his right and reason and perfect and perfect timing i understand find your contact work so well but they the concepts of this individual work just as well for the individuals who are exploring and entertaining them and again are the only thing that they are ready to explore now now it's up to you am i being too insistent no um i feel that the thoughts that i'm using having words your perspective are working better than his thoughts are working for my husband well that is again not really your business your business is what is working for you his business is what is working for him so perhaps just perhaps i am only pointing yourself you are not completely validating his right and reason oh my question was how long before large numbers of people will welcome in contact this is a variable type of idea that fluctuates at best but perhaps as a perspective analogy this can take upon the face of your timeline this can become apparent within the next 10 of your years and can take up to 50 of your years to seem to be completely global now i am not saying this to discourage you i am saying this to simply understand that your experience of what i am saying can be immediate and that is all that matters to you it is not a contest it is a series of timing and their time cannot come anytime before it is ready to occur and your timing will attract the enough individuals around you to keep you company thank you oh thank you join my writing for continuing your health oh you are the one always doing the action we simply revel in many of your choices allow me at this timing in sensing perhaps a degree of overload to in that sense and have a short break of 10 to 15 of your minutes we will resume contact at that time
