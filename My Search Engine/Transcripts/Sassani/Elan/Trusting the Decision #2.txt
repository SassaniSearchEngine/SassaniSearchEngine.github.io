 All right, I'll say, before we continue with the sharing, allow me to simply say, in my society, our particular approach embodies much of what we discuss with you. However, perhaps you would perceive it as automatic approach. And so allow me to say, as you begin to not simply entertain the ideas that we share about consciously applying your decision, trusting and acting on that decision. As you begin to do that, be that person, although at first it may seem as though it is required for you to maintain trust, maintain the decision. You will very quickly find, you will very quickly convince yourself that you are indeed the person you have decided to be. And therefore, it is only initially that it would seem that there is any need to rise to the level of trusting your decision. It simply becomes automatic. You are that person and the trust and support for the decision, the actions through the trust and support of the decision become automatic. In our particular approach, because we consciously understand and revel in the unique opportunity that linear reality has to offer, we actually prefer unexpected results in our reality, in our flow, in our creation, in our experience. To what unexpected results in very many ways are the most sublime creation available to us. When we lay down a particular idea that we wish to experience and may have some mechanical notion of how it may fall into place or how things such as that have ascendancy to manifest, we always work in the allowance for an unexpected result, an unexpected method through which our decision manifests. So therefore to us, something unexpected is not an interruption. It is a vital part of the process that allows us to express our finite nature. It allows us to express ourselves as finite beings. And therefore, we find great joy, revelation, celebration, festival in unexpected outcomes. We understand, however, that any outcome that we might experience and create that is unexpected, although it is unexpected, does not run contrary to our decision, is not evidence that our decision isn't so. Only can an unexpected outcome be a direct result of our decision and our willingness to have our reality be full of surprise, be full of discovery, be full of unexpected manifestation and outcome. So therefore I share this with you to introduce the notion of reveling in, embracing unexpected outcomes as they occur when you redefine, when you read the side, who you are. For that attitude, that relationship with unexpected outcome allows you to begin to look forward to something that you formally considered interruption, a hurdle. Oh, this is a roadblock, sometimes you will say. By understanding that a roadblock is simply a turn in the expected road that actually has nicer scenery, you allow yourself to begin to revel in what an unexpected outcome delivers. You begin to dive into desiring unexpected outcomes. Generally speaking, unexpected outcomes will deliver results that did not seem to be possible at that timing. Will deliver results that would have seemed impossible with a circumstance, but only when you are willing to recognize unexpected outcomes as part of the process, part of the manifestation and not an interruption in it. The very same unexpected outcome will only be experienced by you according to your particular definition, interpretation of that outcome and should something come along that is unexpected and you define it as extraneous, a roadblock. You can only get the effect you label interruption. However, if you revel, if you dive into an unexpected outcome as ah, how creative, this cannot be the one thing that runs contrary to my decision. Therefore, this unexpected outcome is a result of my decision. Therefore this unexpected outcome contains unexpected jewels, unexpected opportunity. Then you begin to achieve or shall I say assume the posture to allow yourself to find the advantage in that unexpected outcome rather than to create interruption. In circumstance, different interpretation. One interpretation, this is an interruption, can only be an interpretation through an old decision which contained I can be interrupted in convenience. The new decision, assumeably if it is an empowered decision, will contain the understanding that everything is part of the process and therefore unexpected is like a surprise gift. Now I get to unwrap it. Now I get to see how this is even perhaps better in your terminology than what I had imagined was possible with the circumstances that are in place. So your willingness to approach your reality through the eyes, through the perception, through the senses of your new decision allows everything that you perceive to be interpreted in a positive way that supports the positive decision as opposed to interruptive. The circumstances themselves are neutral. They are a neutral set of props with no built in meaning. You assign the meaning, you assume the trust in the meaning you have assigned, in a sense the assignment of meaning is deciding, making a decision, trusting that decision, acting on the trust and if it is a negative interpretation only can you experience a negative outcome. So be willing, if you wish, to begin to see through the eyes, through the senses, through the interpretation and perception of your positive completely empowered decision about who you are and nothing, nothing. If you say nothing, I think so, has any influence on you whatsoever except your decision and your interpretation is simply the receptivity that allows you to reassert your decision or change it. And ultimately your interpretation results in decision, in a decision. Thank you for allowing me to share that distinction. Most likely it was unexpected so you are already doing just fine. The second half of this interaction for specific reasons which we will not discuss will be slightly shorter in duration than what you call normal, which to us is quite arbitrary. Everything is either natural or not but normal is a judgment, a standpoint. Therefore, I will allow you to interpret this in any way you wish, perhaps you will just trust me on this one. Or in the time that we have remaining, I ask you how may we mutually be of service to each other, shitting. You are. Hey, sweet mail. I have a software, something in my throat, obviously something I can't follow, it's a separate file. All right. It's from an old decision and it's a reflection. Where do you like to transform? Yes. It's necessary in order for you to believe that you are capable to transform it, for you to understand every single reason that you made any other decision you have ever made. Or can you perhaps entertain the idea that simply establishing your decision right now can have the effect you desire in your life. I might have to trust this soon. All right. Well, you will trust again in something. And now understanding this, you can apply your trust consciously. So my question to you would be who are you? I am a fully conscious being, creating positive aspects in my life. Good job. Now how does your throat feel now? I can follow. Boy. And you are being such a being as you are right now and I invite you to continue to create yourself in that way. Your reality is not a hard pill to swallow and your ability to express yourself is not impeded. It is your gift and therefore you will not create the necessity to withhold or squelch or create resistance. Everything in a sense digesting is simply a matter of deciding to accept your decision. And understanding should you choose not to accept your decision. That is simply a fancy and divisive way of saying I'm going to make another decision. Now again, I invite you to continue to be that decision. And along with it will remain the idea you call physical comfort for who you are is comfortable and only resisting who you are causes the friction that you often interpret as physical, mental, emotional, spiritual pain. How do you feel? Wonderful. Oh, congratulations. Thank you as well. Shilling. You are. Pimeo. Hi. Briefing. Are we calling me Frank now? No. Are you asking me to be French? Oh, my God. Okay. It's about the decision. That we've made a decision and we're living it just fine. But there are other people in the world that we have to interact with. The other person excuse, do proceed. Now, what you are simply sharing with me is something that you build into your decision. A supposition that you can experience. But it is also an option to understand that anyone else's process is synchronous to your own. And as you shift your decision, your perception of other individuals will change so drastically that they will have appeared to change. If you have your decision, be consciously inclusive of the allowance that all others' decisions would never be able to interfere with your own and can only be synergistic with your own, then their process will never seem to interfere with you. You will not choose to interpret any aspect or result of their process as an interference or an interruption. Do proceed or does that answer the question? Well, that's pretty good. But what about this? Pretty good. What about other people have made decisions or believe in things that are kind of positive? Well, they will experience that result regardless of you and your decision. Anyway. But need that be an interference in your process. Or can you understand that if you see something in another that seems to run contrary to your decision, that simply allows you in no uncertain terms to remember your decision. And therefore is a service, has assisted you to re-alise your decision. Now, when you look at it that way, your attitude toward them changes. Your action toward them changes. You'll thank them rather than forsake them. Naturally, their response will have to change as well. And therefore, same set of individuals, one different approach, entirely different outcome. Does that make sense? Yes. Your sound hesitant. No, I was just imagining actually thanking someone for arguing with me. Well, alright. Do you in your statement of who you are? And fear not, I will ask you who you are. Choose to express yourself as argumentative. Is an argument only something perpetuated by more than one individual? I will answer that yes. Or can an argument continue to take place with only one person? Well, sometimes it seems like that. Absolutely. But that would not affect you. And in fact, may be quite humorous. Now the idea is this. What feels better to you remembering who you are? Something to be right, or thanking someone for assisting you to realize who you are. Which feels more natural. The second one. Which is. Thank you, Rose. I'm just reminding myself not to get involved in finding myself to be who I want to be and not be that. Does that not feel differently? Does that not then still allow another individual to have their process, validate their process, but only can whatever your perception is reinforce your new decision. And in a sense, could you not make a case as you say for actually experiencing gratitude toward that individual for reminding you? Is it really that difficult to picture yourself thanking the individual or now that it has been introduced to you? Is it not actually an intriguing option? No problem. Try it. If you try it, then you may get a result. But if you do it, you will get a result. Trying once again, we have discussed this, is one step removed from doing. It is doing with the built in allowance that you may fail. All the trying is not the doing of the thing, but simply the doing of trying. Now in light of that, are you going to try or simply understand truly, foundationally, fundamentally, that individual? No matter what their process is, if you have attracted them, does reflect a service back to you and that you may find it within yourself in how you create gratitude to thank them for it. Thank you. Thank you. Well, now, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Very creative. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I understood. Do you understand what I am saying and can you use this? Definitely. Thank you. Enjoy. For understanding no uncertain terms, that is not the approach which you have formally taken, gratitude, alignment, thankfulness, using everything to support your decision. And therefore, you are now embarking on something new, different, exciting, integrated, and only can you get a corresponding new, exciting, and integrated result. And I would imagine if you are beginning to really accept this facet of yourself, that it would be somewhat exciting. And perhaps you will look forward to the next opportunity to not participate in arguments. Perhaps you will find yourself disappointed. Oh, he's not arguing with me. How can I align? Fear not. You are still alive, but you are getting my point. Hey. Yes. Thank you. Is that all? Yes, that's all. Thank you. Oh, that was quite a bit. However, you don't get away that easy. Who are you? I. How do you spell that? U.M. I. I am a person who does what feels best at any moment. Okay, now I'm a person who remembers who I am and doesn't get led astray at all. Oh, perhaps you get worded in the positive. You remain focused rather than that you do not go astray. Not go astray. Still puts emphasis and focus on going astray. Being focused keeps you focused. Oh, right. I thank you for the gifts that you have shared not only with me, not only with yourself, but with everyone else who created the reflection that you just have contributed. Thank you. Shitting. May I? We understand that time is simultaneous. Is there a way in this physical reality to experience a certain degree of a simultaneous degree of time? To some degree, yes. Through what you call your meditative state, you can get a feel for it. Part of the definition of being a physical being is that you do remain very finely focused in a linear point of view. And so therefore, it may seem as though that's not the natural tendency. However, you are fully capable of experiencing that. However, in a moment that you would create that, you would no longer for that moment identify yourself as you the person. And therefore, if you are looking at it from the viewpoint of you, the person may seem a bit perhaps confusing. For you do define yourself very rigidly as one thing at a time, person, before, during and after. So again, the answer is yes, you can, you are a simultaneous, multi-dimensional eternal being and you can feel this. But having chosen to express a linear point of view, it may seem a bit confusing for a moment. So therefore now, advantages to consciousness. Depends how you look at it. It can be quite exhilarating, quite a wonderful reminder of the nature and extent of your consciousness or if you judge it and do not trust it, it can feel confusing and overwhelming. I assume you ask the question from the standpoint of simply experiencing more of yourself to create an inspiration to then bring into the linear reality. In that case, it will be a positive experience. Simply, understand that it is simply a beingness, not something to achieve. You already exist on all these levels. You already have infinite consciousness and therefore you are not achieving, aspiring, creating, struggling, forcing. You are simply allowing yourself a glimpse of what you already are and what already exists. So that would be perhaps the best approach, that understanding. I also meant that as much as expanding your own consciousness, if the possibilities existed to expand your own consciousness as it is focused right now. Well, ultimately again, as a pinpoint experience, when you in that sense begin to choose that frame of consciousness more consistently, so to speak. Now we are speaking in linear terms about an infinite idea. So there are some difficulties in translating this. But the idea is when you assume the approach to have an infinite consciousness be more germane, more natural to your consistent state of experience, then generally you will experience yourself in non-physical terms and no longer create the type of physical experience that you are experiencing. Does that make sense? It makes sense to a certain point. What would happen to the physical body if you had achieved such a state? Well again, it depends on your reasons and your timing. In general you will not, and you will create a linear idea you call death and then create that experience more consistently, but theoretically, hypothetically, since anything you can imagine is possible, you would have the immediate transformation of your physical body into non-physicality and thereby seeming to those around you as though you had disappeared. So do speak. Hylothetically speaking. I thank you as well. Shitting. Hey, other loud men. As we do. I just wanted to say that I've been talking about in here wanting to write on personal growth and global transformation for about three years and at times getting down on myself or not doing it. Your decision of wanting to has been flawless. Now perhaps you will shift your decision to simply do it. Well, a lot of money ago I had decided to do it and I did. I got an article published on personal growth and stuff and within like one week of doing that and money from an unexpected source showed up to pay off half my dad and I was able to refinance another portion of it like half the university. So it just seemed like by doing what I wanted to do, the university is getting funded for it. So congratulations. You do not expect me to be surprised now, do you? I often have been here talking about how things aren't going and I wanted to. So I thought I would just throw that one in there. Ah! A testimonial. All right. Then you will be evident for others. Thank you. Thank you. And I also wanted to say that in making that change I'm also making other changes in my life. All right, are you making changes or are you simply deciding and being the change? Understand the reason for the timing of this language, the reason for the timing of this word is to create the simple hinge pivot distinction fulcrum that will allow you to not consistently be making a change but simply simultaneously and immediately being the change. So watch your wording. Do proceed. Well, I've got a chance to go out of California and get framed in something that will allow me to go out to teach corporations about environmental responsibility which is a good opportunity and I'm letting go of other things in my life like eating meat and other kinds of things I used to stuff paint. And I have been feeling kind of sad lately at times. I'm just kind of wondering what's going on on a personal level and I've also been feeling that we're kind of on the verge of some dramatic changes in the world and I'm wondering if I'm feeling energy or something going on and I'm wondering if that's kind of impacting on some of the sadness or the turmoil I'm feeling. Transformation in the air, eh? Oh what? Why do you understand the sadness that you experience? What is your explanation? Listen up everyone. Particularly if you think this does not apply to me. It might have something to do with letting go in all of the self-image that I've come from where. So built in to your clear definition is the idea that in order to be who you know yourself to be you must let go of who you are not. Yes. All right. That's one way to do it. Whatever by simply deciding to be who you are does the person you no longer wish to be not simply become irrelevant to who you are and is this not the shorter path so to speak. It does and I would like to do it that way. Go right ahead. It's well that's the answer. Go right ahead. That is how sinful it is. I am not patronizing it. I am elucidated the degree of simplicity that you already employed to now make your conscious decision. Everything you are telling me about your process is decision making. Very specific. Nothing vague about it. And it works flawlessly when you assume in your decision there is a process. There is the need to repent. There is the need to make amends. Then yes there absolutely is. But only because of the decision not being specific not being the most empowered version of itself that simply takes care of all these contingencies. Again there is a distinction that I do not wish to be this negative person and I am this positive person. I am this positive person distances you from the negative person without having to release it. Let it go. Walk away from it. Run at full speed. Away from it. So right now if I were to assign you homework it would be to be more mindful and specific with your decision which segues me into the following question. Who are you anyway? Hello Radian. Oh right. I am on this whole self-love self and others. Oh what? Is that all? That is all I thought about. I am more. I follow my heart. Are you stagnant or are you productive? I am productive. When I follow my heart. Are you fulfilled or are you sad? I feel. Are you inspired or are you paralyzed? I am inspired. Oh. Being willing to define your decision in these terms. Again not from the perspective of who you no longer are but simply from the perspective of who you know you are. Will remove the vestiges that you are seeking of as being process oriented. You have already done this. One day you decided. I am a writer. You sat down and did what a writer does. Wrote from what you are telling me. Getting off the fence and making that decision, trusting that decision, acting on that decision worked with no necessity of process to allow you to make that decision. So you are an expert. Simply now apply this more broadly. Understand? Yes but there is something scary about making that decision. Yes but however. Well like I can relate to what Jim was saying earlier in terms of there is some predetermined plan that we have here. I have often felt like there is some judgmental God or some. Oh right well again. There is in one way of looking at it. And there isn't. So what do you decide? I'm deciding to say that there isn't one there and I don't have any pre-plan to fulfill in my life and that I can do whatever I want and be empowered and follow my excitement and be abundant is somehow scary for me. I suggest that it is not a scary prospect to be who you are. That where the fear comes in is when you pivot on your trust and including your decision the possibility that you could fail which you cannot and never have. Always has your reality. You have a 100% reflection of your decision trust and action. So you have the track record to understand that where you are most constructively focused is in defining that decision very very succinctly. And again this would be homework that I would allow you to have fun with. Write two or three sentences. Not as an affirmation of who you wish to be but as a statement of knowing yourself and consciously deciding to be that version of you. Fear does not come along with that. I want to ask you just two more questions. Why? In terms of deciding to be who I am I will often find myself. I've heard you say that before and I've decided a number of times but very often as I go through my life I find that I'm unconsciously or without being aware of it into the old me or like worrying about what other people are thinking about. Question. Do you notice when you do that? Sometimes. Well ultimately all the time. In order to be noticing it you must be entertaining the new positive decision and seeing it from that point of view to see the distinction and your ability to so called catch yourself is a function of alignment is a function of applying the truck. Ah in this moment I had been functioning from an old decision. Well thank goodness I realized that. Thank you old decision. Ah here's my three sentences. I state them this is who I am feels right feels good I'm back. Do I have to keep consciously affirming who I am deciding who I am or will that become automatic as the old me seems to be automatic. Absolutely as we have shared at the beginning of this particular segment it becomes automatic very quickly perhaps within what you call weeks of your time now understand it can become automatic immediately but because of your preconceived notions generally you will create a lag three days three weeks three months generally three weeks but this is very arbitrary not necessary and we only mention it to work within your preconceived notions. It is truly instantaneous transformations on a gradient but we will not get into breaking it up into complex terminology. And the last question that I had is a friend of mine asked me to ask you this question Tuesday a teacher at Weber Academy and a boy who graduated from there last year was on the BU hockey team and I think last night of the night before was out in his first game playing it in less than two minutes into the game he missed a check and went into the wall head first and broke his fourth vertebrae and the doctors that he's paralyzed for life everyone says with a wonderful guy he has everything the question is how can if you are talking to him how would you help him to accept that and reframe his life so that he could perceive positive futures or himself. There would be many different ways to approach this but one of them would be that ultimately the paralysis was not caused by the so called fourth vertebrae but was caused by the decision using what was appearing to be overwhelming evidence that the paralysis was etched in stone. From my perspective regardless of the physical circumstance the paralysis is not a necessary result. From my perspective it is eventually a decision that is agreed with. Now you will create society degrees of evidence well this evidence perhaps I can relabel this evidence perhaps I can see through the new eyes but everyone knows that evidence is the way it is and therefore the decision embodies that particular assumption. One other assumption AIDS is incurable that is a very erroneous assumption but it is perpetuated so consistently throughout your method of communication your media that it is expected as part of that club however it need not be the case. Well simply deciding to is a sign then he will attract the means he will attract the support system that will enable him to reflect that decision because it would seem to go against your societal grain there may seem to be societal resistance at first and it will be up to him to maintain that decision throughout that idea the societal influence. The other approach would be if he accepts this is what I created and I will now function and explore through the so-called limitation it is up to him but where it is a disservice is for you to feel sorry for him assuming that he himself does not create his own reality and then supporting his disempowerment. It takes strength not weakness to create this heat ultimate strength and honoring that strength allows the individual to be bolstered which is a more conducive framework for making or creating or manifesting positive transformation. Aside from the physical healing how can you go forward psychologically or to view this future life? Well again to keep it simple to keep it as you say on topic simply be willing to make decisions and not have them in that sense relegated or delegated to him. Alright thank you there will be time for but a few more sharing female. Thanks to talk to you this is the one the lines of what I was going to ask about pain in this technique that we're being told about tonight. I would like some clarity or some methodology to transform pain in the moment let's say I'm experiencing it like I stub my toe and it hurts a lot and I say I am a perfectly healthy human being and I am not experiencing pain or I'm experiencing pain oh wow it hurts and then can I transform it in that moment? Absolutely. The idea and again to keep it simple is the tendency in your society with pain is to assign a linear cause a purpose an initiating factor that you then continually refer back to thus recreating the pain seemingly from a singular quote unquote event and that takes the general form of a statement oh there's that pain again rather than here is a completely new moment I am experiencing sensation this sensation may be similar to sensations that I have experienced before however I know I create my reality 100% in each and every moment therefore one other way to look at it is that it is something different now how does it serve me and allowing yourself to experience it will focus you on how it is of service or what it is telling or what particular alignment it is allowing you to make ultimately resulting in your decision being reestablished. It seems sometimes that the pain is interfering and distracting from being able to focus on whatever it is the message is understood but again it is along with the bag of assumptions here comes that pain and giving that pain a birth an infancy a childhood an adolescent an eventual demise as being a continual single source event which it is not true on that for a while and who are you I'm an empowered creator of an incredible journey oh how exciting happy trails sitting on female on the action stage of decision making I'm not quite clear what that stage is to keep it quite simple when you decide who you are and that decision is perhaps a new decision and you begin to trust that that decision is registered that decision sticks that decision is now who I am. Preceptivity toward opportunities that allow you to express that person and willingness to act on those opportunities is how this falls in translating that into the framework. So not wanting to go back on the old way people well again being the new way not not being the old way but when you make the new decision and know that decision is who you are obviously since it is a new decision new circumstance will arrive new opportunities will come up that would not have been there before and that is where it is up to you to act on them through being willing to be open to opportunities and diving in and moving around and doing what that opportunity affords. I guess what I'm asking is the end of the decision is made of the action stage comes into play somehow there's universal energy that our probability will show your whole reality shifts when you make the decision and then what you attract supports the decision which is why we are calling them opportunities to express the decision but it generally will come in the form of something to do something to say something to think something to be something that would in that effect have you move your body and do something. Otherwise the extent. So other for now that will be as an explanation. When you make the decision only can new opportunities arise knowing this sets up a positive expectancy and perhaps a level of excitement opportunities are forthcoming which you say you enjoy therefore the only other aspect of being completely engaged and committed to your decision is your willingness to act on the opportunities as they come up. In your old decision you would see an opportunity and not do it but your new decision doesn't leave room for that for you are productive you are active or whatever your decision entails that allows you to energetically move through your reality and therefore perhaps at first it may feel as though you are motivating yourself to do motivating yourself to be active in the opportunity but that is short lived. Fairly immediately and even directly immediately if you allow it the opportunities will simply be so compelling so overwhelming so attractive so doable so effortless for you because they are opportunity that represent who you choose to be that there will simply be no question this is what I need to be doing period that is the action. Thank you. And who are you? I am a conscious creating life being. All right. Proceed. Sometimes this evening could you tell us who you are? Oh, it brings to mind your saying turn about is fair play. I thank you perhaps. Now I am having fun with you. Allow me to simply say I am a joyous, productive, serendipitous being who marvels and revels at unexpected outcomes and is engaged fully and committedly to the creation and experience of my reality and all it entails. All right. Allow me to say for you well put. By the way, laughing through the channel, the channel laughing is the form of alignment. Were the channel to laugh? Literally there could be a momentary break in the connection so to speak. I will not go into the mechanics of this now simply accept that. But do understand that though there may seem to be a consistent demeanor within what you perceive to be the channel that we do laugh, revel and enjoy these interactions. Allow me to thank you for sharing that. You proceed. I have a relative who has cancer and she's given no chance of living by the medical people. She has small children and I find it easier to understand if it was just her. But when I think about her leaving her children I have a hard time with it. I'd like to know if you want to comment on maybe what the message is. You said before the sickness is a message and the person who gets the message and there's no need for the sickness. Do you perceive that this individual has even entertained that a message could be gotten? I don't have any reason to believe she has. Then assuming that that is not her approach this would simply then fall under the category of her timing and the timing of any other individuals that attracted such a scenario. What is the question? Well the question was going to be what might the message be specifically for her if that you didn't feel comfortable answering that. Again it is up to the individual and I would be so bold as to ask her. Or even asking in such a way to honor her sovereignty of choice as an individual may seem to her to be a new approach and may be liberating in and of itself regardless of if it seems to have any physical result. But again perhaps another way to answer this is you're asking the wrong person. So then I was going to ask you with something as severe as this what types of messages might there be in general? Again there are as many different messages as there are individuals but it would seem to be on the surface that this individual is simply ready to manifest transformation known as death. And that allows her to explore what she will explore in that particular scenario as well as any of the children, family, friends and relatives what they will explore about it. Do not mean to be vague but there are reasons for the style of this answer. Okay thank you. Oh thank you as well I have done nothing. Shutting. You're lying. Male over there. You're lying. Vincent here. Greetings. Greetings to you. I had an interesting thing happen here today. I'll bet you did. My copier would not copy documents. It kept getting jammed paper. It kept getting jammed. All right. A synchronicity story do proceed. Did you assume it to be extraneous or did you assume it to be part of the process or perhaps did you assume both? One and then the other. One and what occurred. I took the document out of the machine. I said there must be some reason that I can't copy this thing and it was a mistake on it. I fixed the mistake, put it back in the machine, took another look inside. There was a piece of paper in the way and I didn't see it when I checked before. Pulled the paper out. Worked perfectly. Now can you explain how I did that? For what reason? You already understand it. It is simply utilizing something that heretofore would have been a roadblock and interruption as part of the process and in fact deriving great service and shall I say accelerating your process along on its way. By accepting everything, everything as part of the process then you act like a creative and so you did. It was fun. Now do you think you can duplicate that? In everything in your reality. And perhaps you are now the machine. I find myself doing that more and more now. More. He'll free it any time to simply do it. Always. But more and more, if that is a comfortable gradient by all means take your time. It shows up every now and then. More. We thank you. Would you like to know who I am? I suspect whether or not I would. You will help me. However, of course I would. Oh my goodness. That's for one of yours. Ah! I read your mind. I'm a student and a teacher. You all are. And I'm enjoying life tremendously. The enjoyment factor. Nice touch. I find life very joyful. I believe you. And I enjoy your company. Oh, thank you. Oh, you're fine. Well, I enjoy all your company as well. And I remind you that anything you see at me is simply the splendor you contain. Congratulations. And finally, one last sharing mail. Peace. Well, oftentimes I hear people talk about things that are happening and things that are going to come, like the problems in the inner city that are happening, the economic shifts that are happening, or the earth changes that are coming. You know, they talk about these things as though they're external, they're inevitable, and they really are not looking forward to these things. And they experience them, by the way, in this way, for it is built in to their decision and there is no one the future. There is an infinite number of probable futures so everyone gets to experience the results of their decision without disturbing anyone else. Precisely. It seems fair to say that there's an infinite number of possible realities. And while we all experience our own subjective reality reflected back to us by the people around us, there is an apparently that. That many of us are in agreement as to what so. And we experience a reality that has many common elements. Would seem similar, though it is only truly an agreement of parenting, but do proceed. Exactly. The assumption, however, on the part of many, is that in fact we're all within a reality with specific parameters and there's very little flexibility. Absolutely. The assumption is that, by many, not all. However, it's obvious that we're never going to experience anything other than what everyone has always experienced. If one by one, we don't take responsibility to go outside the paradigms, push the bubble back a little bit and create things in a way that we prefer. Recreate the bubble altogether. Exactly. Pushing again. These things that we perceive like earth changes and economic shifts and they're like, from retrospect or from the viewpoint of the future looking back on it, we realize how it was absolutely perfect that these things occur. And that in fact, rather than being the catastrophe you thought they were, they did in fact facilitate the transformation that we're all saying we do want to experience. Thank you for noticing. And that's who I am. I understand for the possibilities. For one. I already knew who you are, but thank you. Thank you. And it's good to be visiting with you. For one. At this time, allow me once again and for the first time, for I create myself anew in each and every moment as well, to thank you for your willingness to give the gifts of the expression of the reflection of your decision of who you are. This brings me enrichment and understanding about myself as a being and your particular approach is how I chose to reflect that to myself. And so to me, these are riches beyond measure, as you say. I thank you for your willingness to unwrap yourself and share the gifts that you are with me and with other members of your society. And for now, we bid you Amos, Fond and Lovey. Good evening. Bye. Bye. Bye.
