 I'll write out things. Before we continue, allow me to simply say the question will arise from time to time. Why or why if I am an infinite multi-dimensional and eternal all-knowing being, would I possibly impose forgetfulness? That in that sense resulted in forgetting over 99.9% of who I am, oh tell me why. Alright? You ask for it, you get it. You understand that each presentation and version of consciousness, no matter which direction in that sense in a linear way that you come at it from, has unique advantages. When you are in that sense all-knowing, when you are infinite, when you are all seeing, there are certain levels or nuance of experience that are simply irrelevant. They become meaningless within the overall spectrum of all-knowingness. Therefore in order to experience these types of awarenesses, these phases of awarenesses, certain parameters are necessary in order to enable it. When you are all-knowing, when you are all seeing, there is no meaning to the experience of discovery. There is no meaning to the awareness of learning. And there is no opportunity for the idea you call the unexpected or surprise, for there is simply nowhere to hide from yourself, you are one complete whole-knowing being. And so therefore the primary reason for choosing finite life, linear life before, during after, space and the time necessary to move through it, is to be able to relish and enjoy the experience of discovery, the joy of discovery, the joy of learning, the seeming apparently of expanding into more than you already are. And unexpected outcomes. Now understand in no uncertain terms, when you are living randomly and your decision is random and changes with the wind, changes in that sense with whatever tides arise, then in that sense. So and that is our fundamental. All right, change in direction. Sharing. As you do, good evening. Are you now in your and my galaxy? Well, in a sense you will understand physically I am upon my scout craft orbiting my home planet. Which is in our Milky Way galaxy. Not in the way that you understand the defined galaxy. It is an overlapping dimension of experience that is literally a separate galaxy. But in the overall scheme of things would seem to occupy the same space out of faith. But you said you are roughly five hundred one years distance. We were saying that as a standpoint were you to actually materialize our realities into a common reality. That would be the, shall I say, approximate direction and distance. It is arbitrary and we no longer use that designation. Have you visited other galaxies in the universe? Yes. I can't resist asking you. Do you have access to how many universes there are in total in our multiverse? An infinite number. Now, I understand this is because of the multidimensional nature of reality and the idea that finitiy actually exists as an expression of infinity. Not to confuse you, but simply so that you will understand that you are an infinite being anyway. Then these numbers are more meaningful. You made it clear that in third density I can't grasp concepts of infinity. So I want to switch to what I really want to ask you. And that is would you tell us how to most effectively slow down the aging process or even reverse it? Absolutely. Live most fully and be an effortless expression not creating what you call the friction that seems to wear away at your physical body. Thereby being a joyous expression your body rises to the occasion of being exactly the vessel that it needs to be to express your consciousness. And so you need not have the built in stuff positions. Again, now understanding that your body exists within your consciousness that there need be a degradation. For in fact, the degradation is built into the decision and therefore self fulfilled property. Would one of the contrary? If that's too simple. Well, I'm going to have to deal with that later. Oh, why? If you say so. Okay. Let me ask you. Is one of the contributing factors to shortening our life, stress of time, schedules, v-pack, chopra, interesting. The made clear that are in the word deadline is the word death. Oh, right. The idea is simply the idea that what you are expressing will either be a function of who you desire to be or not. When you express yourself fully according to desire, there is no friction and it is pure allowance. When you take on any nuance of expressing yourself in a squelched manner, you create the very friction. In that sense, you can, functioning according to your excitement and passion, create the idea you call physical deadline and have that simply be stand points, timing, schedule conveniences and not something that you produce stress around. So it merely depends upon the terminology and the context that you are presenting the question. I know I'm sort of jumping around on this. Tis all right. I've always had the idea that before we enter this game we call life, that we have made some major decisions with our over-sull and it would seem to me one of them would be just about when, how we're going to die. Not necessarily in that sense. For the purposes of the living, you may understand that this is not etched in stone. There is a way of looking at it, understanding that all realities are true where you can say that your birth and death are fixed points. Though that is only true from a particular standpoint, understand that much of what you call truth is contextual. Depends on the context that you are presenting it from and in shifting context something can have an absolutely opposite meaning and still both are true. From the idea of spontaneously living your life and presenting yourself according to preference and joy, that is not necessarily a fixed point and you will perceive that you are ready and then transform. Then perhaps afterward you can say well they were fixed points in that sense. It depends where you are asking the question from. You just imply that we sort of consciously or unconsciously choose when we are going to pass on. Perhaps you can say in a now moment of your life to be most accurate. On this, the sami, why do your friends die? Generally, the understanding is that what we have come to explore has in itself completed cycles and we are simply aware of the things that we have to explore. Perhaps we wake up one day and say hmm nothing to do today. All right, I will transform. But it is very matter of factly, very serendipitous and because we understand and honor ourselves as infinite being only stepping through a door and not truly any type of an ending. For individuals who still choose to remain physical and alive can still be in touch with us due to the nature of the fact that our communications are on what you would perhaps refer to as a mental level to begin with or a consciousness level. I have the idea that the normal life expectancy on your planet is like 300 years ago. A proxy. And we have our bodies have the potential to live that long also. Believe it or not? Yes. There is a telephone. Or shall I say believe it? Yes. Not? No. We have heard about a fellow named but Susala, somewhere back in our history. Can you relate to that and tell us that he really lived pretty long? There are examples of individuals who have lived many hundreds of years throughout your reality. In terms of that symbol, it will be perhaps you can say a slight exaggeration of such an individual with a longer lifespan by far than what you call the average. Well, thank you very much. Oh, before we proceed. Allow me to continue to say that when you create yourself randomly, your interpretation of the advantages of being finite, the unexpected can be to interpret the unexpected as an interruption. When you are consciously creating who you are, you understand that everything is a part of your process and nothing is an interruption in it and begin to embrace the unexpected. As another way to get what you want, another way to express who you are, that came completely by surprise. And so your relationship with the unexpected shifts. Now as an example of how you can work with this in a physical way, I was saying this before. Suddenly I had no awareness of the next thing to say. Many of you in that particular instance will lament and judge yourself. I simply checked in to see if indeed there was a blankness, nothing to say and understanding that there was moved on to the next thing, understanding that stopping in mid-sentence was not extraneous. Was part of the process. Was by my estimation a bit unexpected. I did not expect that to happen, but happened for a specific reason that is useful. And so therefore whether the unexpected is interpreted by you as an interruption or as a complete enhancement of your process will depend on your willingness to express yourself preferentially or randomly. And so therefore thank you for allowing me to finish that notion. Sharing. Yes. Male. Greetings. Angel. How do I not feel nervous when I ask you a question or when I do some other type of public speaking? The idea is to reinterpret what you are feeling. You are assuming is to be anxiety. Perhaps you may understand that this is what excitement feels like. Can you redefine that feeling and begin to identify it as extreme excitement? Are you willing to? Yes, but it does not feel like it though. What does it feel like? Fear. Fear that what will happen? It will also now be judged to make a fool of myself. Has this ever occurred in our interactions? No, not here. All right. Can you then not use the momentum of that knowingness to simply relax a bit? Now you know in no uncertain terms no matter what you say I will not judge you as this so. Oh, so what else are you afraid of? It's not so much that I'm afraid that you'll judge me. It's just that there's a feeling that I'll somehow fail or kind of. People in doing what all you have ever done is in a candid and frank way presented your point of view out on the table so that the many others all of which have some version of what you are saying. Can now see how to interact with the various thought patterns that you create around yourself. So therefore you have been of supreme service in these interactions and are continuing to do so. Now how do you feel now? Okay. I'll. Perhaps that's the step in the right direction. Well, I'm a little anxious because there are some stuff going on in my life that I wanted to ask you questions about. You know, as I was sitting here thinking about what I was going to ask I was noticing that I was feeling nervous so I thought I would ask that. A civil reminder. Listen with new ears. Excitement and anxiety are the same energy one being interpreted in a positive way one being interpreted in a negative way. If you feel it as anxiety remind yourself that it is excitement. Do not allow the feeling to dictate your interpretation because your interpretation no matter how you want to hide it or close it is always a decision. You decide to interpret it that way. And so if you find your initial tendency is to interpret it as negative nervousness you always have the choice to say, ah, wait a minute, anxiety and excitement of the same energy. So I know there's excitement in there. Now how would I be interpreting it to be excitement instead of anxiety? Well I know I'm going to get something when I have this interaction. By the way in any interaction not by any means limited to what you will interact with with me. And you can redefine that feeling which will in no uncertain terms shift the edge you perceive that it has. For you to remind yourself in interacting in any given situation that no matter what you say you're going to get something out of it. Is that not exciting? No matter what you say positive or negative you will get something out of it. Does that not shift at least partially your interpretation of the circumstance? Are you excited to get something out of it? I do believe I'm going to get something out of the series. All the power doctors you've already gotten a lot out of it. You continue to get a lot out of it though you will often speak from perhaps you can say a slightly disempowered viewpoint you already have transformed. And it is simply a matter of using the quote unquote new legs you are standing upon in a more conscious way, in a more definite way. We have discussed that you can influence your output by being mindful of who you are being. In other words, if you see yourself as a powerful communicative being with something to offer and picture such an individual you will see they are sitting up straight, they are holding their head high and they are speaking with conviction in their voice. And simply by reminding yourself of that shifting to that person adopting or adapting that demeanor you can feel the shift instantaneously. Speak to me and continue to speak to me saying anything you wish as though you really mean it and watch the difference. Well, the question that I was going to ask wouldn't be asked from that perspective. If you say so, it can be. Though if you wish to assume a disempowered state to ask the question by all means go ahead and then I will show you how you could have asked it in a more empowered way. Well, what I was going to say is that I understand how the anxiety I feel could really be excitement. But I think good sir. But I think the fear has to do with some kind of belief that if I am verbal in front of others that somehow they will discover that there is something wrong with me. So there is some kind of underlying feeling that they ask you a question. Is the assessment from someone else that there is something wrong with you? Meaningful to you if you do not agree with it and if you do not agree with it and they assess that. In other words, you do not participate with their assessment. Are it only they, the only ones in the interaction creating negative feelings that they are feeling? When you say there is something wrong with that person, that does not feel good to you. If that person does not participate, you are the only one feeling bad. So even if someone were to have such a notion of you, what does that truly have to do with your notion of yourself until or unless you agree with it? Now fundamentally I remind you that you do not agree with it. You understand your base of power. Otherwise you would not be here, otherwise you would not continue to persist in defining yourself in empowered terms. So beginning with that as a given, ask your question. Well there is a lot of stuff going on in my life. There have been times in my life when I felt very confident and I guess when I felt good about myself I have not worried about what others thought of me. Alright before you proceed, can you imagine those times? Can you see yourself when you were that way? Yes or no? Alright. Good. Proceed. Okay. That kind of relates to the question. Oh. What are the reasons that I think? That this does not seem to be one of those times for me. That this seems to be a time when I guess I am defining myself as being not good enough for something. There has been a series of negative things going on in my life and understanding that I create my reality. I guess I have kind of been blaming myself and feeling that I am on this downward slope and at the age of 38 you know, heading into maybe some kind of midlife crisis where I am not going to get. By the way, in my eyes I am your baby but do proceed. Ah, teen eyelid 38. Understood though, I understand the societal baggage you are carrying around. Do you proceed? Anyway, the negative things that have been, I guess I took this, I really have felt in my heart that I want to be a voice for integration and connectedness and some of the stuff that you talk about here in a very practical way. For example, working with business or you know, things that are going to make tangible differences in the world. And I took this environmental training in February but that hasn't really, it's slow coming together. So I haven't been out teaching anyone about that yet. And I've kind of been feeling like I'm kind of backsliding. Oh, before you proceed, what you are calling backsliding, spiraling downward and many other creative terms that you use, do you acknowledge that you are participating in the process that is resulting in you feeling this way or do you still carry the notion that it is happening to you? No, that's that's that's that. Do you understand that you participate in it? Yes or no? Yes or no? Yes. All right. Do you understand that you continually are making decisions throughout this process? Yes or no? Yes. All right. Do you understand that the voices that say you're spiraling downward are choices and nothing that have inherent power over you? Yes or no? I do. All right. Does that not then put you back into the driver's seat as the decide er to simply be a little bit more forceful, a little bit more definitive, a little bit more committed at making those decisions according to your power as opposed to making those decisions according to some notion of backsliding, which is still using your power simply in perhaps you can say a non-constructive way. Well, I understand what you're saying and there have been many times over the past few months where I've been sitting there having a negative thoughts or whatever and saying I know that I'm creating this, I know I'm choosing to focus on this negative thought. Let me now choose the positive thought and focus there and then I do that for you know. All right. Allow me to be more specific. Play this game if you will. When you have a negative thought. Do not necessarily focus on a positive thought, but actually ask yourself all right, all right, I'm entertaining a negative thought. First of all, I'm only entertaining it. I'm not committed. I haven't decided. I'm evaluating it. Ask yourself the simple question. What is the exact opposite of this thought? You will find in perhaps every instance that the exact opposite of that thought is what you would prefer to believe. They're both on the table. They're both true. But now rather than focusing on some good thought that pops up, you are specifically addressing the thought that you are having, you're acknowledging it, you're not denying it, and by posing the opposite, you're placing a choice on your table that will be simple to choose and that is specifically geared toward the negative thought. Or shall I say more? They accurately specifically face away from the negative thought. So you're not running from the negative idea. By choosing the positive thought, you simply can no longer see the negative. By being willing to play this game, what is the opposite of this thought? Is that desirable? Yes. Far more desirable. Well, now you have your pivoting point. Now you have your perspective. Now you have the thing that, well, yes, if I thought this, I would sit up straight. If I thought this, I would feel excited, not anxious. Are you willing to play that game? Or is that too simple? I played it and I will. Let's assume you have not played it in exactly this way. Let's assume phrasing it in this way, the exact opposite of whatever that thought is, is new and is the thing that will make the difference. Play with that. If you continue to say, I'll just try that same old thing out again. You are not doing what I am saying. You are doing some, perhaps you can say, distilled version of what I am suggesting. But if you do what I am saying, you will actually begin to welcome some of the negative thoughts because the exact opposite of them is who you desire to be. And so who you desire to be is always right in front of you, even if a negative thought comes in. There seems to be some tendency to give more weight or credence to the negative thought. Really, interesting decision. Do you think it a constructive decision and do you understand that it is a decision? For another decision, the exact opposite decision is that there's absolutely equal weight. You will decide there is equal weight or you will decide that there is not, but you still decide it. And you are beginning to get what I am saying. I know what you are saying intellectually, but when I am sitting there at home and feeling negative and knowing in my head that I am creating this and I should be able to focus on something positive and act that way. At times lately, I haven't been able to do it all. But not something positive, that is nondescript, that is non-specific. That does not necessarily address the fact that you brought up the negative thought to begin with. Not something positive. The exact opposite of the negative thought, fraying into a sentence, placed on the table. Immediately obvious which one you desire. Now you are going to make a decision. The decision could certainly be, well, negative thoughts, ways more. Though you can also decide, you know something, it really doesn't weigh more unless I say it does. Oh, it's very heavy. I can also decide they are equal. But now that I see the exact opposite, I have clarity. The negative thought has served me to point me toward the exact positive thought that will be useful to me. If you begin to do what I am saying, what you call negative thinking in this way will begin to simply disappear because you will be continually aligned to the positive. It's not that the negative thoughts go away. They are still there. They are out of your peripheral vision. They no longer have a meaning for you. There is somebody else's scene, not yours. Proceed. If I continue to argue for your disempowerment, I will continue in that sense to provide the powering ulcers. I am here to transform it. That's what I want to do. Oh, I will let's go a step further. You just have transformed and you will continue to make decisions which can continue to state that you are already transformed. The exact opposite of any negative thought can be an extremely delightful empowering game. If, as you say, all of your instincts are wrong, then the opposite of all of your instincts are right. Whatever it takes to align yourself to who you know yourself to be is useful. And as you remain aligned, the negative thoughts become irrelevant to your new choice. You empower the negative thoughts by assigning weight to them in a decision. They do not have inherent weight. They are all weightless and equal. Are you willing to accept that? Yes, but it's listening from yes. Yes, I am, but there is an example. No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Understand. Were you to do any less than continue to express who you are, you would be short-changing us all. That is what I've been saying the whole time. Proceed. Okay, well, so I just want to step off my question for a minute and give an example that addresses the point that you just made. Why all of me? The choice is positive and negative or equal. How about an alcoholic that's in the final stages of alcoholism and you could go up to that person and say you can stop drinking right now. And but why is it so hard for so many to do that? I mean, to that person, why is that an example of a non-successful outcome for you? I do not understand the correlation. The reason that I brought that question up is because a few times ago when I was here, there was a discussion about alcoholism which said that it's a choice. It's a series of complex interwoven decisions based on certain disempowered assumptions that create an aparency of a condition. Absolutely valid. It can be experienced exactly the way it is described. However, it can also be understood because it is a series of continuous decisions and you have the complete power to decide what you want. It can be seen in a different light as well. The point is in interacting with someone else and posing to them the possibility that they can transform this themselves, there need not be any insistence on your part that they embrace what you have to say and choosing to validate or invalidate yourself based on their acceptance or non-acceptance of what you have to say creates your own decision making system to be based around external symbols rather than your own decision and knowingness. Are you the alcoholic we are speaking of? I have been in AA for eight years but that wasn't the person that I was, because I'm open to the idea that it is just a choice. Are you willing to commit to the understanding that it is definitely a choice and choose the opposite? Yes, but I wouldn't want to go and start drinking again now. All right. You need not. The reason I use that example is because when you are saying that all decisions are kind of equal in the mind of the mind. Now, by the way, what we are discussing is for the individuals. Again, everything is in context. The context we are having this discussion is our individuals such as present in this room who are entertaining and may be committing and persisting but at least entertaining what we are discussing. This is not necessarily going to apply directly and immediately to an individual who is completely unaware that they make decisions, completely unaware that their decisions then result in trust and result in action. In other words, this is relevant for you who are beginning to understand and have an understanding for the mechanism. The reason that I use that example is to give an extreme example of how I feel in my mind sometimes when to me the decisions don't seem equal. See, I really want to have the stuff that I'm talking about, the career where I'm sharing and coming from my heart and not afraid of what others are thinking of me or the relationship is fulfilling. I really want that stuff. But sometimes the steps that I need to take that, the decision in the opposite direction of that seems so much more weighty that I don't know how to... Can you provide an example? By the way, from my perspective, you are not an alcoholic. That is a very limiting term that does not, if you will, jive with your new understanding of yourself. There are old notions you still entertain, a lot of entertaining going on here, though that would not be accurate. But do proceed. Any example where you can place a non-preferred negative thought pattern on the table, post to me its opposite, and argue for why the negative has more weight. Okay, well, for example... By the way, this is fun. I have a deadline. I have a writer. I write reports about utilities. And last night I had to get a report written. And I said writing these reports is going to get behind a deadline. I'm running late. I need to get paid and stuff. I've got to sit down and write this stuff. I know I shouldn't go lie down on the couch and watch TV or something. But yet I went and laid down on the couch and watched TV. Oh, what? This is more complex than you are presenting in terms of the fact that perhaps what you are arguing for is doing something that does not excite you to begin with. Is that true? All right. And so in perhaps you can say absence of the commitment to do the things that excite you, you still have made commitment. And by continuing to honor these commitments and perpetuate these commitments, you're spending time that now is not available to do the things that excite you, correct? That's true. Therefore, what you are experiencing are the typical results for continuing to perpetuate a version of yourself that is not in sync with your own knowingness of who you are. That's why I took the environmental training in the spring and a few times when I went out and taught that, I got a really good high from being up and speaking in front of the group. All right. But does this have direct variance on reports to be written? No, to see the environmental thing didn't materialize that I needed to pay my bills. So I had to do this, take this contract again for another year. Otherwise I wouldn't have any money to live on. By the way, that is an interpretation, a decision, and was not necessarily true. If you had not signed the contract, I am not, by the way, advising you on business matters. I am simply making distinctions. I am not saying cancel the contract. I am simply pointing out that had you not signed the contract, you then would have been sort of had free time. You would have had to do something and assuming that the idea of excitement is beginning to resonate with you and you will create something from your excitement that something produces a result, produces reciprocation, produces compensation. So in my assessment, my simple opinion, you would not have run out of money. You would have shifted what you were doing and created the system of support necessary to continue to do that thing most fully. To do something like that would have meant to have to take a lot of risks in terms of going out and trying to get maybe consulting work or public speaking work or writing material that I would want to present. I guess that is just too overwhelming to me. I know I can do it on some level but on the other level I have just been too afraid that I will fail or that people will like me or whatever and don't find the time to do it. Do you acknowledge that you in this entire process are continually making decisions? Do you believe that you are the decider? Yes. If not, who is? The one. All right. It all boils down to this. Your decisions can be conscious. You can use whatever tool you can come up with in your imagination to allow them to be. But no decision is made for you. Only only our decisions made by you and everything that you are describing from a disempowered state is a series of decision making ideas. The exact opposite of the very negative things you are saying are far more in alignment for who you choose to create yourself to be. Your willingness to allow the specific opposite to stand up and allow yourself the reaction, the feeling, the gravitation toward the thing you prefer actually gives the idea you prefer more weight. You need not function, assuming the negative ideas have more weight. You can use your attraction toward the positive ideas to give them more weight. All of this does in that sense require in your sense of the term commitment, though it need not be an effortful and laborious commitment. It will require in that sense initially persistence, but only because the way you all create yourself here to for you have been very committed and persistent about. It is simply a matter of replacement, not getting rid of anything. There's nowhere to put it. Replacement, choiceing. Are you willing to play with this? Are you willing to allow yourself to feel inspired by the opposite of your negative thoughts? Yes, I'm willing. All right. Then you're in for an exciting time. Do you feel anxious or excited? I'm excited now. And you have gone nowhere and done nothing. Simply shifted your thoughts, shifted your thinking, perhaps instead of entertaining a notion momentarily committed to it, and boom. I'm sure I can find some anxiety. Yes, you can. Because if you could not, you would not be a complete creator. Though you can build into your decision-making process the idea of construction or constructive net. What will serve me? What will allow me to express myself preferably? Will this negative thought serve me? No. Will it allow me to express myself preferentially? No. Will this positive thought? Absolutely. Oh boy, suddenly this positive thought is a little heavier. You understand the thinking process? Yeah. Are you willing to entertain it? Yeah. All right. I'll take it further and commit to it. Yes. All right. I've got about four months of consulting anatomy on this utility stuff. A suggestion. Do not factor out your excitement when doing that. And remember, excitement expressed with integrity can only have a positive result. You can transform the four months to at least be a more accurate expression of your joy. That is an option. When you decide, we are suggesting to be specific. And when the negative thought comes up and you determine it's opposite, you have a very specific positive option. Not some nice thought. Some positive things. You have the very specific positive cotangent idea that will assist you to balance and pivot and give you a choice that makes more sense for who you now choose. Not settle for, choose to be. How do I find and get to that place of where I want to be? You're there. Right now. In terms of the practical steps, the things that are going to bring me what I want. All everything that you need is at your disposal. You can only start from what's available. Even if it looks like only a bit is available. That is what you have to work with because that is all you need right now to move, expand into the positive space, so to speak. Follow my excitement. With integrity. Okay. Well, the original question that I wanted to ask, has to do with the series of negative events happening in my life that seems to be continuing, but I don't want to stop. Can we redefine terms? Can we say to be accurate to give you back your power 100% series of neutral events that I have continually placed a negative interpretation upon? So easy to do. Regardless of the reason, can we at least call them that instead of inherently labeling them as something negative? That has its own negative energy because it does not. Everything is neutral. Your meaning that you assign completely determines the effect you get out, that proves it's neutral because if you assign a positive meaning and get a positive effect out of the same thing that you can assign a negative meaning and get a negative effect, it must be a neutral symbol. When these things have happened, I've recognized that I've looked at it positively and said there's got to be a lesson here for me and if I learn it, I can stop the series, but I haven't been able to stop it. So it's been frustrating to me that I'm not able to get the message. Oh, another way that you can label these things as they happen is I cannot see any apparent positive meaning for this, but I have made a positive decision. Therefore, it has a positive meaning that I'm not aware of. Because I am not aware of it, it's time to do what I am aware of and it becomes irrelevant. If something, a new neutral symbol comes along and it may feel that there is a tendency to label it negative, you need not compound it by saying here's another one, which builds into the decision that there's some momentum or continuity. All of what you call this series of negative events are truly isolated neutral events that you are attaching negative meaning to and then stringing together the beads and using them as evidence against who you are. Ultimately, then deciding using the very evidence, which is only your interpretation, but nevertheless, you decide you act, you get a result. Nothing can interrupt you and anything that appears negative is being interpreted in a lopsided manner. If you are not able to see what is obviously positive, there is a reason for that. Move on. If you can see what's positive, by all means, clean it and use it. There is nothing hidden. There are no compartments. There is no subconscious because the moment you entertain anything from it, it's conscious. Understand yourself as a 100% being that everything you need is at your disposal. In fact, you always know what you need to know, when you need to know it and if you don't know it, you don't need to know it. And that will allow you to stay on track continuously, continuously expressing yourself in positive terms. Not a sense of desperation or running from the negative, but because you have a sign that the positive is simply your preference and more in alignment with who you, who is the only one who knows you, know yourself to me. Well, maybe you can help me see the positive on some of these, especially one of them that is really traveling to me. Alright. The first one is that my car got hit by a taxi and put it like a small dent in it. Oh, how exciting. But I thought of a motorcycle that turned out to have a bad transmission. And then probably the major thing that I had a really hard time letting go over the past two months is for about a year and a half I've been leading an Altean group with about the 15 teenagers have been coming to and enthusiastically participating in for every week. And their parents and the guidance counselor that oversees it, then, you know, give me a lot of praise about how well it's going. It all seems to be going fine. And then this lady from Alonon who wanted to start another meeting, I didn't know about it and I got the space that she wanted before her, then after that another lady came into the group and I told her that it was close to the delts and I get that hurt her feelings even though I said it nicely. So those two went and complained to the steering committee. They sent the letters to the high school which said that I wasn't running the meeting right and then it could. Oh, the so-called name of the group has changed. Do the individuals still participate? Well I haven't gone back to, I don't want to run a group that's not Altean in the high school wants to be certified by Altean anyway. Oh, one. Another question. Is who you desire to be worth being? What do you mean? The you, the preferential you, the desirable ideal you, is it worth being? I don't, I don't, yes, I mean. Absolutely it is, correct? Yeah. All right. Is there anything that has enough worth or value to remove your commitment to being that person can a dent, a transmission or a group talk you out of who you are? And if indeed you allow that apparently to occur, does it not ultimately only culminate when you decide that that's a reflection of who you are? Even these things truly move you off center or they simply a bunch of neutral props that are not worth in any way shifting your perspective of yourself. And in fact in dealing with the specifics of fixing the transmission, taking out the dent and deciding the disposition of the group, will that not be most effectively managed by being in your power and presenting yourself as the preferred you? Well I've got to go and speak to the steering committee in about two weeks about this whole thing, we'll send a little in there. Congratulations. Which you will you bring to that presentation? Will you bring the you that knows in no uncertain terms, in no uncertain terms, the value of what you are doing? Or will you bring the you that is apologizing for who you are? Well the me that's apologizing is the angry me that wants to get revenge on them for being treated unfairly. But both use exist which do you prefer? I don't want that one. Which do you prefer? I do not wish to hear what you don't want even though I just said similar thing. Language is an interesting barrier sometimes. I prefer to know what you do want. Which you would you prefer to see walking into that room? Which you would get the result you desire in that room? Well I absolutely want to be want to be centered and loving and you know confidence in myself and be in no way attached to how other people treat me. Alright now you know what you want. Tell me what you'll do because you're going to commit to something and it's up to you right now you can actually commit to what you just told me. Yes or no? I'll commit to that. Alright. Are you willing to have that same person address the dent and the transmission? Well I already took care of the dent. But with the transmission I tried to negotiate with the guy and he wouldn't call me back so I'm taking a small claims court which I really don't like to do because I've never taken anyone's court before but I felt that he'd have an option. He kind of likes me about that fight. You're shaking your head no I guess you think that's a bad option. What you are perceiving is a scanning and not in that sense a negative response. Understood. The idea is this. The positive you, the you you know yourself to be in your power. In any of these circumstances we'll get the best result. If you use the circumstances to shift your decision and you have the whims of your decision dependent on your external circumstance you will continue to seem as though you exist within a reality where things happen to you. If you simply decide nothing is worth talking yourself out of who you are and maintain that and are willing to see things as neutral symbols moving while aligned to your positive self. Everything is transformed. You are a different person than walked in. You will continue to express yourself in this manner and these neutral symbols which appear negative will begin to be neutral symbols which appear positive. And there is a very positive result that can occur because of this so called group situation if you walk in in that sense being your powerful self. Very powerful and very unexpected. What is it? You sound surprised. It is the results of the splendor of who you are being willing to take something you feel strongly and passionately about and presented in a loving and integrated way. All right. Now I believe you. Is there any other arguments for your disempowerment you wish to discuss? How about this more claims correct? You are always experiencing the reality you are being the vibration of. If you are the vibration of blame you will experience blame. If you are the vibration of getting the job done you will get the job done. It is completely up to you what you do and how you address it. There are always integrated positive solutions. And when you avail yourselves of them you will truly create a more positive emotional response to the result. The idea of vengeance is a so called reaction if you will to feeling power. Displaying your power is simply a statement that has a positive result and feels far better the result that is than anything vengeance in that sense can accomplish for even if you were to get the revenge. In hurting someone else back for hurting you you do actually hurt yourself. I absolutely don't want to do that. All right. That is up to you and I will not advise you as a specific simply remind you you experience the reality or the vibration of what kind of energy do you wish to bring into any interaction including that one and it is up to you. And should you choose a more positive vibration you will find a course of action and you will do it and you will accomplish what it is you wish to accomplish in different way. I think the crux really matter with the vengeance is that and perhaps all the stuff is that I've been feeling like a victim lately and how do I get out of that. Because of your decisions I am a victim is simply a decision. I am a person who used to feel like a victim is a gradient. I am the creator is all the way on the other side. I am a victim perhaps you can say is a negative thought. Its opposite is I am the creator. Which one feels better. Which one even sounds like it has more weight. I am the creator sounds better but there's a place of doubt in there with it. Which one feels like it has more weight. I am the creator. I am a victim. Depends on what they get me. Alright what they get me now. Which has more weight now. Now sitting here talking to you sitting up straight I feel more like a creator. Alright. Then by all means use whatever visual symbols or cues is necessary. When you are wherever you are you can sit up straight if you wish to picture me. I am more than willing to function in that way while still reminding you that you are doing it all. Though whatever symbol is useful to align yourself use it. Fine. If it can have more weight now it can have more weight anytime you pose it. It's up to you. Get thinking. But ultimately it's coming from with it. There's no thinking. There's nothing to beat or pound in. You're letting it out. Congratulations. Thank you. Now is there anyone in the room who is judging this man. Even if they were. So what? They could only be judging you if they are judging some level of themselves. Or if they were completely 100% unconditionally self loving they would have no tendency to judge anyone. Even if they didn't understand why they were doing what they were doing they would understand that whoever the person is in whatever they're doing they do have their own right and they do have their own reason to do that. All judgment is a reflection of self judgment. When you do not buy into the judgment and create your own vibratory version of it it has no effect on you. And if you find yourself doing that it is a simple matter to remind yourself wait a minute the opposite thought of this is unconditional self love. The definition of unconditional self love is I love myself no matter what end of conversation. All right. Thank you. I have done nothing. Okay. We're choosing everything in our lives and we see things how we choose to see them. Is there a line is there a limit to what we can expect? I mean if we want something happen or we want to change something in our lives. Can we change physical things? We're human beings walking on earth and we're told that we should be healthy food to live long and be healthy. But what if we really like chocolate and we look like there are other things that you know I mean others. Well do understand first of all that there is what you call individual physiology and what you call the national average or national norm in some ways is a service but in many ways is a disservice. We're not allowing individuals to develop one of the most important senses in what you call substance which is body intelligence body feedback and trusting that body feedback intelligence to use your very own example what you call talk a lot is in that sense containing certain nutrients that are quite beneficial to many individuals. Whether they to trust when it was time in that sense to feel to eat that to simply eat it stop when they felt full and moved on they would attract exactly the proper in that sense amount of chocolate to establish and continue to express what you call body equilibrium. It is a matter of trusting who you are and trusting what you know to be true for you. If you do decide that someone else's version is true for you you can get that effect as well. Therefore what you are speaking of is a result of assuming that there is a one baseline way it is in terms of eating and then judging yourself when you deviate from that and not trusting your own particular sense of discernment allow me to say something else. An individual to use your example who eats chocolate will only experience a negative effect from the guilt and not the chocolate. Therefore if you begin to get a whole of your decision and part of your decision is I trust myself I trust my body I trust my feedback I trust the mechanism if I feel like eating that apple I am going to eat it when I am full I am going to stop eating it so on and so forth you will find your entire relationship with what you call food you will find the entire effect that you create in regards to such sustenance will automatically change you have that complete power now to take it one step further and there are individuals to substantiate this individuals can literally survive without eating they however are completely aligned in a different way for their understanding of who they are now I am not saying stop eating I am simply saying that yes you can affect your reality to that specific degree though generally when you trust your body intelligence you will find there are specific reasons for continuing to do certain things and by trusting the intelligence those reasons become more obvious and aware to you do you understand yeah is that helpful or is there some other question that arises from this no well that's good for the food part of it so so we can affect almost anything I would go so far as to say anything not almost anything though if you are creating it on a gradient then yes almost anything the idea however is that whatever occurs in your life that seems random and non-preferred is generally the result of your vacillating decisions about who you are when you maintain establish and maintain the decision of who you are consciously you produce results as that person they catch up with you and the entire face changes so that explains why there may be things that are non-preparential that exist right now for individual sometimes they will I would never create that that proves I don't create my own reality well what that actually proves is you don't have a complete grasp of the mechanism and that you have been continuing to make decisions as you will though not realizing the impact of those decisions and therefore getting again a peppered result as opposed to a continuous one but you can affect the entire face of your life and it starts by getting in touch with yourself who am I what do I want and so forth setting up the personal template around which you build your reality is there something else I don't think anything is important proceed anyway well okay so if you decide that you want to live a certain way but there are other people around you deciding otherwise then you're going to be the first one in the pack of trailblazer a groundbreaker the point is you need not utilize anything anyone else is doing as an excuse to keep yourself down and in being willing to shine in such a way without even meaning to or needing to you will have impact on other individuals who say wow that works only will someone else doing something seem as an influence on or upon or to you when you fall into alignment with your decision of what they are saying if what they are saying continues to simply be irrelevant to who you are it is simply shifts passing in the night no matter how often it really boils down to you and your perception of other shifts as you shift yourself anyway for you interact as they are also multi-dimensional beings you interact with different aspects of them that already exist and that perhaps the old you did not draw out the new you now will so they will seem to change as well again I remind you that there is no necessity that they do and paradoxically that makes them more conducive atmosphere for them to change for individuals are very rebellious when they think others are telling them to change oh I was going to do that anyway but not now was the point made or is there some degree of distinction that we can dive further into thank you thank you have a chocolate bar and enjoy at this timing I wish to thank you all for being candid and being willing to express yourself in no uncertain terms as you are you need not fear the reaction of others for when you begin to have your decision be positive the others that you attract are now attracted more consciously they're now attracted to who you are who you want to be not the shell not the version not the mask not the face if you're being someone you are not you'll still attract people who would like that type of person however they may wind up being someone else's friends when you are willing to be who you are those that you attract now will support that new decision and so you need not continue to have the supposition that what you have to say will be laughed at it will not be laughed at by the individuals who you now attract to support your new decision and again anyone who laughs at it anyway is laughing at themselves judges you is judging themselves displaying anger towards you is feeling anger and the results of their own anger you are in that sense isolated though at the same time by being willing to embody yourself that way you open yourself up to all other possibilities which is truly a sharing and not an isolation another paradox I understand though still this is how it appears in your reality I thank you for your willingness to allow me to expand my knowledge of myself by interacting with you who from my perspective are simply reflections of me and I bid you a most fond and loving good evening.
