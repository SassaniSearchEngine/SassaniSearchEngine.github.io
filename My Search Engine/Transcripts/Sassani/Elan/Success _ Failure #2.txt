 Allow me to say, before we continue, it was the day or night after Christmas. And everyone was stirring and having a good time. We had discussed briefly prior to your break the idea, and perhaps this is timely with your holiday or holy day, of the second coming. And discuss that this second coming, so to speak, would not occur through a single individual, though it may be expressed, by single individuals, but would be. The expression of that energy, the Christ energy, within each individual. Now allowing an expression in a more full way. Allow us, before proceeding, to shall we say define, just a little bit more the idea of how this would present itself. And at the same time maintain complete and utter simplicity, for it really boils down to three overall ideas, which again have many branches and many shall we say off shoot. But basically, three ideas will embody the Christ within you, will allow you to know, if you are asking from that particular aspect or center of your being. Number one, will be unconditional love itself. For the Christ energy that we are discussing with you now, is unconditionally loving as it is a direct reflection of what you call God, of all that is. And all that is is the embodiment energy, so to speak, colloquially speaking, of unconditional love itself. So expressing that in your physical reality, through what you consider to be your personality, takes the form of being willing to express unconditionally, unconditional love. No conditions. I will love you, period. I may not particularly like what you are doing, but I will love you. I will understand you have the right and reason. I may not choose to interact with you, but I will not force take you for who you choose to be. Simply establish an alignment. I agree. I do not agree. And have it be all right either way. That is unconditional love. Again this need not mean you condone a reality you do not prefer, but not condoning something simply takes the form of not acting that way, not embodying it. The utter condonement, so to speak, is being that way yourself. Seeing them all right, a dose of their own medicine, is being that same idea, and matching the thing you say you do not prefer, and acting that way. So your willingness to acknowledge and then simply choose the actions that correspond to your preference is unconditional love, in action, in effect. Number two is excitement itself. For the expression of your fullness and totality is the expression of your excitement, of your passion, of what moves you, of what brings you joy, and allows you to feel as though you are expressing yourself utterly according to preference. So therefore, unconditionally loving, excitement, and the third shall we say idea is integrity, which links very strongly to the first idea of unconditional love. For integrity is the complete, the complete willingness to acknowledge the integration of all things. The integrity, the integral connection and interwovenness of all creations. It is all within you. Even the ideas you say you do not prefer must be within you, or you would have no ability to perceive and see them. Since you are choosing point of view and focus, you still get to look at ideas that are within you, which are no longer representative of who you are. But this is a gift, this is psych, this is expansiveness. Being able to see things that were, shall we say, expressed from you and now simply are being viewed, allowed to be expressed by others. Integral, all one thing, always one, one is all. This is integrity. Or if you are willing to express unconditional love, if you are willing to determine and act upon your excitement and express the actions of your life with integrity, that is all there is to it. You are expressing what you call the Christ within you. By simply, shall we say using that triadic template. That is all there is to it. Now again, you can add many details, but you will find it all boiled down through these three ideas. That encompasses it all. That is what your Jesus, the Christ, was embodying, was showing to your society. Look, this is possible. You can do this. I am not saying it is the only way. I am saying it is one way. There have been many misinterpretations of this, but none of them direct transcriptions from the mouth of Jesus himself who would be colloquially speaking, perhaps, a joke rolling in his grave. Were he to see many of the ways that his ideas are being, shall we say, misinterpreted. To actually mean the exact opposite of his clear intention, which was simply to walk his talk, express his unconditional love, which took the form of appreciation, which took the form of willingness to forgive, even what was considered by the society to be the most despicable of characters. That is the removing of the conditions and demonstrating in no uncertain terms that this is possible and that the individuals respond to this. When individuals are not invalidated, they respond. They look, they turn within, they use it as a mirror. They see, if someone else is willing to validate me at all costs, I may just be willing and able to validate myself. Living through example, living by the embodiment of the ideas you say you prefer with unconditional love, excitement which adds some spice and makes it a little bit more fun and integrity, which is a recognition, not a moral standard, a simple recognition. As you say, sometimes it can be summed up simply by your terminology, do unto others as you would have them do unto you. That statement is the recognition of integration of all things. Let that sink in for a while. In any given moment that you are expressing this, you are expressing the Christ. You are picking up the ball and running with it. You are being applauded by what you call the angel and what you would perceive to be a singular expression of the Christ, him, her, else. But that is only one expression. You are each and every one of you, another eye of all that is, eyes of creation itself, a facet, a point of view, this sink complete and absolutely utterly worth it and deserving of your unconditional love, of your excitement and of your integrity. Therefore, Merry Christmas. Before we proceed, we wish to also applaud you all once again for your willingness to begin to participate in these interactions by being willing in that sense to define what it is you wish to discuss and begin to focus. Not in an exclusionary sense, but for the purposes of furthering your understanding, for the purposes of increasing clarity to singular subjects and ideas, for now perhaps for a while, as you say, and we will also allow some spontaneity about this. We will concur with the idea of you discussing at the break many subjects and then, unless there is an overwhelming consensus, perhaps we will, in sensing much of the energy, pick one. However, nothing is etched in stone. And should you find in that sense that the one we pick is simply not the one you wish to hear, please share that, for that is an expression of your willingness to continue to contribute and to assert who you are understanding that you deserve it. So our particular choice in this instance to get the ball rolling, as you say, will be the idea of expectation and disappointment. Is anyone disappointed about that? All right. I will take that as a no, and it simply does not matter for when it was stated there was in that sense a consensus reached. Therefore again, if someone disagrees with it all well and good, simply stand up and speak. If not forever or perhaps temporarily, hold your peace. We also will mention that if in anyone's interaction someone else is unclear about a particular point, you can feel free in that sense to ask for clarification, not in the form of stepping on who is speaking, not in the form of, shall we say, grabbing the sage for each one is in that sense worthy of attention and of direct interaction, but in the form of in that sense, considerate request for clarification. This will be most useful to all involved or understand if you do not understand something about what is being said in a particular interaction. As you say, chances are there are others with the same question. Simply trust it. One other idea. Many of you seem to have an issue with it. When a topic comes up, a question perhaps is asked. Thereby you say what a dumb question. It is our strongest suggestion and that is all it will ever be. There is no insistence from us that you do anything. However, it is our suggestion that you perk up your ears and listen to that answer more closely and carefully than any other answer. Or if you have such a button to be pushed, why do you have that button? And what is the actual relationship of what you are invalidating when you say that? So therefore, simple suggestion is up to you. You can judge away, do whatever you wish, but you will find service. And many times, the greatest advantage in what you call these buttons that are pushed and where you choose to think that something is extraneous. Well how did that get in there? Perhaps that is the point. So again, it is up to you as it always will be. We thank you for your willingness to not only contribute and co-create this interaction, but allow for the channel to express himself as he is. For this to us is of great service to us. As any particular channel begins to embody and begin to take responsibility for who they are, it makes it that much more, shall we say, easy and flowing and simple for us to express that much more through that channel. There are no conditions upon our arrangements and there are no conditions upon our agreements with channels. But there are certain facts to how things unfold and again the more a channel chooses to act and embody what we are seeking of, the more of life vibration can be created for us to match and then therefore ease. And increase the flow of our communication, the clarity of our communication and interestingly enough the amount of information that we can bring through which again as a channel embodies, not talks about, not says it sounds like, but embodies what we are saying. That much more can we then flip in things which the channel would seem to not know, which is of great desire to many of you and as well no less believe me to the channel. That we can now begin to bring in information which may seem on the surface to be quote unquote new. It is all new anyway and you already know it all anyway so this is rather arbitrary, but I believe that we have made ourselves clear and I thank you for your willingness to allow me to ramble on. Shutting. Hey. How are you tonight? Perfect. As are you. Thank you very much. I have a number of questions to say. Oh, I will put a number on them. But I will put a number on them. You just did. I took that. Oh, erase that. Yeah. I want to ask you to feel for the whole thing of attention which we got earlier and I will put my excitement in the video and one of them happens to be just show with the ash charcoal and then a four-part series and one of the shows, one of the things ash called an asleep Mackage motion. and we had an extra chair in the studio, except for that, which was heard. Now I was told before the last show we should start, tonight at that show, that the Lord Sonanda, as you saw through Jesus Christ, from Lord Sonanda, today called a chief commander of the Apleetius of their dreams, was to a transliteration. Our understanding of the transliteration is to have the figure of the Christ himself or the one Sonanda, or whatever other name you might want by, is the term. The chance figure of the form of the body that's in the chair, in the chair, I'll make a correct with that. First of all, our particular understanding is that what you call Jesus the Christ is not precisely the same as what you call Sonanda. What you call Sonanda is an individual expressing the Christ, so therefore the Christ, but not necessarily what you call Jesus himself. Now I understand that there are many separations within this concept, and that it's a one, shall we say, hand, Jesus and the Christ are synonymous. The synthesis is generally presented in an exclusionary type of way, we wish to draw the distinction, so therefore there is a difference in the two energies. Right, so Lord Sonanda basically has the same Christ energy as we all do. Right, so there's no difference, sorry, please. Okay, well, they've made changes, plans, and worked for Nanda, and I was saying in the studio, no way I'd interact with questions, my gosh. I just, looking, I couldn't, I didn't know what to do, he said, I was in a situation where I looked at the eyes changing, and turned into the eyes, and when you look at somebody's eyes, they say you can see into their soul of their being. And looking into the eyes of the things that at least were different, is in the hands of the day of the eye process, not necessarily for this Lord Sonanda himself. They said that when people do the show, various people seem to go insane. Well, that is a given. Well, is that depending on the ultimate of their consciousness, to the other realities of existence, or if not having really a practical order to see the eye on? It is strongly related to what would in fact serve them, so therefore will vary greatly from individual to individual. So some people might have to see anything. Perhaps you can say most. Okay, so therefore that brings you to a frustration. Oh, all one. Because I was told one thing was going to occur, and in actuality, what occurred was not maybe a dream that was made. Ah, now, may I ask you a question? Yes. How does that allow you to feel? What did you discover and what choices did you make? You feel frustrated. Oh, I felt frustrated. Oh, I felt frustrated. I don't feel like it's right away now. I felt frustrated because I was putting myself on the line. Thank you for that, so, with viewers. Oh, my. So I felt that that connection would be turned on the line, my intentions would be turned on the line. Oh, and did you feel that it was breached? Yes. In what what? And how was that? It was very viable. So it was breached by a group in fact that they had opened the question of the door, so to speak, and the door was a multitude of options. And the options, I felt that it would go into being down properly. And then you feel that they did not deliver this? No, and I wasn't just going from my delivery to as much as it was for, the audience. Well, do not factor yourself and your own expectations out of this by any means. However, what will you now do in a similar circumstance, having learned and integrated from this experience? Will you put yourself out on a limb again? Not so quickly. Ah. So therefore, you have defined your sense of discernment. You have become more discerning, correct? Oh, what's most effort? Oh, does this not serve you? It does. I think that there's a lot of controversy over the ice parts of it. And much of it has to do with what you colloquially call grounding and remaining grounded. Therefore, now you get the opportunity to decide to what degree as you are exploring spiritual realms, as you are exploring extra terrestrial realms, just how firmly it serves you to keep your feet on the ground. It serves you to keep my feet on the ground for my own integrity. And for your audience as well. And them seeing how you will choose to use this and how you will then, shall we say, alter your behavior, to now embody your new sense of discernment and understanding. We'll be a learning experience for all. Also, your willingness to allow it to be all right, that you were in that sense that trusting in a particular circumstance, and you felt slighted, allows your audience to see that they are dealing with a human, just as themselves. So therefore, you have increased your rapport with your audience if you choose to view it that way and enter the situation with the, shall we say, alterations, with the changes, embodying what you have learned and perhaps sharing it with them. Well, I feel like I want to share it with my willingness because I feel a sense of disappointments, because, you know, leading up to a mountain hospital, they would like, we started from the bottom of the mountain and we went gradually pouring it up to the top to see what we've had. But the point is rather than there being an embodied extraterrestrial, being at the top of the mountain, your sense of discernment was what you climbed up to see. So therefore, you are at the top of the mountain. You can swing back down to the valley or begin to yodel into, shall we say, the depths of time and space, and now express who you choose to be. Well, audience, perhaps I was wrong, or whatever, not necessarily that you were, but the idea is what you are feeling, your willingness as an equal to share that with your audience allows them to see that you are learning too, that you too are willing to perhaps explore beyond the shall we say quote unquote normal boundaries, and you too are also willing to see where it does, but also does not work for you as well. We see opportunity and advantage lining these clouds upon your mouth and top. I also felt that, I mean, we had good dialogue that asked how anybody has a subpoena, or the autocorps, and instruments, and lighting, but if I had gone in that direction without putting up the possibilities of the force, what's practical, and the relationship with the presentation, I might have better off directing my attitude in that direction. Well, not really, for you learn something very important. Again, given a similar set of circumstances, I assume you will make a different decision. Well, I'm going to set the way low. I have one other question. One moment. Not yet. There is also, again, what we will discuss in more detail in the future, so to speak, since it is the past to me anyway. The all are nothing principle. If there are things that you truly enjoy from those sources, take them. If there are things that don't work for you, push them aside, but you do not have to push it all aside unless you choose to, that is also an option, but because some of it did not work for you. So your willingness to see this work for me and this absolutely does not make you that much more clear, makes you that much more defined, serves you to explore and define yourself very, very pointedly, and also allows you to see how to proceed from this point forward in your channel. Oh, it's clearly good. It's really the final one. It's the one program. Oh, I have one other question about the ascension process, and that is, in terms of the way the ash part command contains the whole thing. It's a talk a lot about, or it's one of the workshops. It's about the God and the ash part is about two radio stations three weeks ago, which was in Connecticut, and ash part things were being buy-in and then had a penis. And a lot of people call on the talk show that were religious scenes, and you probably can bring religious angles. Before you proceed, understand that the source that you call channel, or whatever you wish to call it, has religious background and expresses and interprets the information through religious terminology, whether or not that is its original intention. Therefore, it can automatically only attract other like-oriented, religiously-minded individuals as well. Right, but it is the ash part of the man that has a glory instrument to communicate their information and bio-life to be religious or spiritual, or is there misinterpretations from the general society when speaking in the estate from the say radio station? Our perception is that the misinterpretations are through the individual channel. Now, we do not page it in any way as a chastisement or as a beratement. Now, simply that there are certain, shall we say, background perspectives that get thrown in there, which are not necessarily intended. Therefore, there is coloration of the material in this regard. So it's still still still. Well, to some degree, yes, perhaps you can say that. In an environment, information can be filtered as opposed to channel information or just- In varying degrees, from almost non-present to very filtered. There are many examples of filtered communications in your society. Well, they talk about the attention. Also, do not assume that your individuals upon your planet choosing to function in this regard do not have free will. So you need not necessarily come from the perspective of why would they choose someone who would do this? Agreements are made, but the individuals then have the free will to embody the agreement in whatever way they will. Again, walk down that hall they will, but how they walk down that hall is completely up to them. And this is understood going into, so to speak, the arrangement. My understanding of the offensive process is that we are going really forth to the extent of going into shift and in shift relation, but they also being so set around to the point where we will physically, at some point, interact with the equivalent of what we call the ending of the older, which we consider the older, to the newer, which is the template that is in effect. And the difference in the new work is that we are different. So it's being part of the art. We are only the part of the art, but- So to speak. But the arts would be a different part in terms of the shift dimension. And is that your understanding of that? Well, in a sense, yes, though, our terminology differs slightly. We prefer, again, to come from the perspective that you are now in third density. Perhaps what they are referring to as fifth dimension would correspond to what we present as fourth density. For to us, in our particular explanation, fifth density is non-physical, and we'll then, therefore, generally not associate with what you would call a planetary body or symbol of that type. So it is similar to what we call fourth density. Understand also that as the individuals upon a planet undergo a transformation, so does the planetary vibration itself. What you call your earth, perhaps you can say in- All right, again, this is colloquial. But in second density awareness was referred to as a cation. So therefore, even the name may seem to change. But it is a pivoting point, so to speak, through many overlapping dimensions of experience. I understand- Proceed. The thing about before, when we were mentioned about the question was raised before about the beginning, the wave of extension. And the other thing is that that wave of extension is the extension of whole consciousness, and that's right. Well, what we are speaking of as transformational age, initiated in your 87 year with an occurrence you call, or colloquially referred to as harmonic convergence, is, again, a wave of conduciveness for the unfoldment of the unlimited nature of consciousness. Okay, I understand that. What they say, or Ashpar says, is that the first wave of extension has been 44,000 eagles. And that's quite certain because that's been named by eagles. But that would be the first wave that would actually be under free will if they wanted to be deemed up into this ashparcimanship for further information and other things on the shift. And the answer is, the answer is, the answer is, the answer is, the answer is, the answer is, the answer is, the answer is, the first wave, and then go into the project of the... It's been basically a secret to helping other people. We have discussed this. The idea is that much of what you are understanding and receiving is cloaked into what you would perhaps colloquially call biblical metaphor. Right. A reference to the 144,000 and so on. Which was 1,000 eagles' biblical metaphor? Right. In our perspective, it is more representative of the idea of oversold, which can be literally millions or billions of individuals. That are in the meat-oriented answer to the point that came out in the sense, yeah? So therefore, the start to the connections are that their physical bodies, which maybe could contain a sense that they all are in a sense, all of that. You can say that. I am not exactly sure I am catching your drink. Can you be more clear? Well, if you say they are oversold, my understanding is that if you ring-furnated into physical bodies, you ring-furnated from other experiences, other lifetimes, other dimensions, you will be out. Hey, but many times an oversold will not only manifest in what you call past life and future life, but also multiple contemporary selves. So therefore, one oversold can embody anywhere from several to hundreds of individuals upon your contemporary time frame on your planet. So 144,000 oversold, and again, this is rather arbitrary, can represent, again, anywhere from thousands to hundreds of thousands to millions to billions of individuals that are living upon your planet right now. Thanks. Okay, I'm... Are we getting somewhere? Yes, we are. I did a lot of force in my mind. Oh, thank you. I might have to sign through that, Dad. All right, please do. The oversold, you're talking about it on a tennis, but are there any oversold of people that are existing on the side where they do everything? Are they ever sold or not existing here? Are they just in something dark? In a sense, you may understand this to be an arbitrary question. For what is strongly associated with your planet, Erysphere, is what you would call the embodiment, and the oversold itself is timeless and spaceless. So this becomes a bit confusing. It can be seemingly associated strongly with the planet in one sense, but in another sense completely transcends physicality, so it becomes an arbitrary question. Again, I refer you to the fact that your body exists within your consciousness, therefore so does your planet. But if you wish to get more technically accurate, so does your solar system, so does your galaxy, so does your universe, so time and space become quite arbitrary. I do not mean to add more confusion, but sometimes accuracy about infinite matters will do just that. Does this, however, give you any answer to your question that you can use? Oh, thank you. Confusing is simply taking many portions, rearranging them, looking at them in a new light, and then making a new commitment to who you are. However, if you wish to clarify, ask a specific question. Well, when I was done here, I'm reading a book that's a little sign of a new consciousness, but... Well, not personally, but you're close to me. Can we be translated into the past few years? All right. A translation of the... Okay. One of the things that was the consciousness of a G- that this is a direct analogy to the over soul and the physical self. Perfect. Proceed. But also, you just said that our own souls were around too, even though they made me another way. I...it may present that way, but you are again speaking of a transcendental idea, so though you may in that sense sense projection or extensions of it, never in a physical finite sense, could you completely house the idea of your infinite over soul? Unsettling as it may seem from this perspective. Is that even more confusing? No, that's clear. Oh, thank you. Are you through, tennis? I thought I was. Oh, thank you. Simply being courteous and making sure. Thank you very much for all your answers. Oh, and to you, for your marvelous answers, pose that question. Shutting your alarm. Oh. Pimeo. I had a question about agreements. When are the agreements made and how do you know what they are and when the earth was the actual name? They've come to us from the end of the noise. Well, sometimes it will present that way. Agreements of a specific form may be made between what you colloquially call live, between live. Other agreements will simply be embodied into your overall essence. Many times you will, shall we say, proceed from within when the playing out of an agreement is most timely. However, remember, you are not within a reality. The reality is within you. So anything that you perceive within that reality is also within you, though it appears to be external. So feedback from the external reality is also another form of understanding the unfoldment of your timing. One other way to put this is simply to let the situation be obvious. And if something is not forthcoming, if it is not right there, if you cannot act upon it, this is an external expression of your internal agreement. Does that make sense? Oh, what? Then continue and do not settle till it comes. In other words, can I make an argument now? Absolutely. And the nature of unconditional agreements is that you can also choose to not do it. But yes, you can make an agreement right now. Do you wish to? But then the other person has to argue. Well, in general, your desire for the agreement tells you it is available. Do you wish to make an agreement right now? Yes, and I have expressed that, of course, in my own mind. And now again, this connects to your talk about intention, intending something and acting. Is that what one is supposed to do? Make an agreement sort of in your own mind and then say, this is my intention. Is it the thinking? Well, there are no supposed to, but yes. Simply having the intention and then looking around very astutely and seeing, can I do anything about this particular intention right now? If you can, there's your external, so to speak, indication that this is the timing. However, if you cannot, there is also your external indication that this is not the timing. However, by then focusing back into the moment, seeing what's available and choosing with your excitement, you steer yourself toward that clear intention. Standing around and going, oh darn, it's not there, doesn't steer you quickly in that direction. In fact, lengthens the process. Do go on. I kind of had a problem understanding intentions. I'll give an example. Oh, thank you. I'm going to finish this video soon. That is simpler because it's up to you to finish that, to go to college and get the degree. But what if the agreement or the intention includes other people or other people, then you have to wait for them to feel the same thing. If it includes other people upon your planet, perhaps sometimes you would then rely upon the feedback from them. If it includes entities that you are channeling, you will understand that your desire and your understanding of your timing tells you that it is their timing as well. It is your timing. I assure you. Do you wish to boldly state the agreement you now wish to make it? Place the order, so to speak, to the universe. At this point, I might have changed. I have sometimes like, maybe a couple of months, like I have lived the order. I thought it happened and now I'm not sure if it is. Oh, it is. But what you are also learning, and I trust you in listening up, is about discernment. You get choices. Choices that will agree with you and will not, so that you can decide and empower yourself to decide, this is what I wish to have and intend to have. This is not. My reference to you in interacting with you internally is one with expanded sense. Your interpretation of that reference was what you had shared in the last interaction because you strongly associate with the sense of smell. It was not incorrect to assume that I was communicating with you. Simply you are given the opportunity to discern where you had plugged in something and where I had offered something. Does it make sense? It can make more sense, Lisa. Oh, if you say so, you can create all the time you wish. But understand, the agreements are in place. You are being given the opportunity to prime the pump, so to speak. And by deciding what you wish to interact with and what you do not, you become clearer. That clarity allows the agreement to be fulfilled with laser-like precision. So therefore you are, shall we say, approaching the completion of the process of perhaps getting some information that may not agree with who you choose to be so that you can decide and say, no, this is not what I choose to channel. This is not what I choose to express. This is. That makes you part of the process rather than thinking that you need to remove yourself from it. And this expedites or speeds along or accelerates the process itself. This will become more obvious. Yeah, and I'm getting there. I can see that I need to add. All right. Well, after interacting with me, do you feel better or worse? More confident? Oh, thank you. Now we're getting there. Is that all? I wanted to share with my daughter, Sarah, my younger daughter, she was here, she wanted to meet you. She's very excited and she's having a good time. Oh, thank you. She would like to say hello and I think she would like to ask a question. Oh, please do. And my unconditional love and welcome to you. I don't know what they are. Oh, well, perhaps you will ask, what should I ask? What should I ask? Oh, well. May I ask you a question? Sure. It much truly excites you the most. I don't know. Being here is pretty exciting. Oh, do you in that sense like the idea of expressing yourself and creating the life that you prefer? Yes. Are you attracted to the idea of unconditional love? Yes. Do you, shall we say, gravitate toward the idea of excitement? Yes. Integrity. Merry Christmas. We thank you. And should something come up? Something seem like a curiosity. Do remember there is no such thing from our perspective as idle curiosity. If you are wondering about it, it is worthy of being expressed and shared. And we thank you for saying hello. Thank you. And to you. You want to hear that? One moment? I am choosing it. Over there. May I ask you a question? Greetings. Oh, imagination. Thank you for reading this to your life. A question about my house for two years. I have been looking at different options for my career. Applying to concepts as well as my excitement. And when I look at TV, we are looking for all situations. I get passionate about the times in the world and feel because of my business background and perhaps problems I will be dealing with. Could I be able to help develop solutions to those problems? Now, before you go on, that feeling and the desire and the excitement about this tells you in no uncertain terms that you are able. Otherwise, it would be extremely and pointless. Well, thank you. My question is best at kind of gets to my question before I ask it. Well, thank you. Ergonomics. Because I have always been insecure and tried to get validated externally. Now, before you proceed for the purposes of accuracy, you have not always been that way. Yes, sir. One moment. Again, I share that you have not always been that way. Perhaps you are choosing to express it in the wink of the eye of your soul that you call this life. But you have within you to draw upon great strength, great conviction. So perhaps you may wish to toss that one out. Thank you. Oh, thank you. And remember, that was colloquial. You can't toss anything out. You cannot get rid of anything. But in transforming it, it may have that apparently. Well, my fear was that my excitement about helping the world and developing more sustainable economic systems might have been coming from a place from brandy osteoartha. Well, which is it? Tell me now. Well, I... I'm asking this, my excitement. All right. There's your answer. Okay, now, developing options, job options, some are opening up in different parts around the world. But nothing has solidified yet. And it almost seems like I'm becoming less clear on what I should be doing now. And I'm getting scared because my money's gonna run out in about two months. So I have to start working for the next month or two. How often do you say my money will run out in three months? Oh, now it's two months, so now it's one month. Well, I've been saying that for about a year. Oh, all right. Watch what you asked for and watch what you assert. You get it. Yes, but it's been expanding through yet. I'd rather not have to go that way. Oh, is there something that you can immediately act upon that excites you? Not something to keep you busy while your excitement is, shall we say, while you are waiting for it? Not that I'm aware of. There's one partially exciting option, the best alien option. Oh, partially? It's not, it's not manifest yet. I like to maybe do a consulting contract for you, building the rod. Is that exciting? Not really. Oh, what? Do you really wish to do that? No. All right. Now that that's out of the way, what can you say? Well, I would like to somehow, I've been trying to write a letter of position paper off with my eyes, expressing my ideas on family's report. After all we've discussed, you are still trying to write a letter? No, that's what you did. Now, I am not making fun of you. I am simply pointing out, sit down and write the letter. Stop trying and start doing. When I sat down and began to write it, I haven't been consciously clear, and I felt more like going out and taking a walk or reading a book or something like that. Oh, a suggestion. Very simply. First of all, do not sit down to write it unless you are initially excited about doing so. But once you sit down for there have been many times where you have had that initial excitement, yes? And you begin to, shall we say, create a similar seeming pattern. Stop. Take a deep breath. Take three deep breaths. Think about something that does excite you. Drum up the vibration of the excitement itself, until you feel it in every fiber of your being. Open your eyes, write the letter. Connect with your excitement first. If it wanes, do it again. If it wanes, do it again. If it disappears, get out of there. My fear is that if I express those ideas, I'll be rejected or a little splashed or something like that by these steps. Ah, fear of failure. Will you still have the clear intention, even if they say get lost, charmly? Yes, because I feel like they're going to have to face a similar way. Well, can you then truly ever fail? No, but... This is one of the reasons we discussed in the beginning of this interaction, that particular perspective on failure. Failure is simply selling yourself out of your clear intention. So, remind. Remind. Remind. Remember your clear intention. Assert it. Call it forth in these moments. Do you have a fear of success? I think so. That's right. We've also discussed this. So, plug in what we have shared with again, allowing the feedback of your reality to simply be completely obvious. I desire this right now, and when it comes along, the coming along is my indication that I can handle it. Remind yourself. Simple remembering. Okay, so, by accident, I'm going to buy how... Well, you will express that abundance in positive, exciting terms. Okay. Okay. Another question. I've been applying a process of choosing to follow my excitement to the present moment, and have been creating some wonderful things in my life. However... Oh, here it comes. I think it goes through the... Clothes, and however... I wonder why I back look from doing it. I mean, I'm like, it's fun. It works. Question. Why do you back off from doing that? Fear of failure, fear of success. Again, plug in what we have shared. It will come in handy. It comes in the most handy while it is happening. Sounds nice while you're sitting here happy, having eaten some nice food. And interacted with many lovely individuals. But comes in the most handy in situ, in the situation. Remember, remind, use the tools. You have them all. Your toolbox is unlocked. Your tools are shiny and ready to go. Oh, thank you. Another question is, on my left side, I drove through my hometown and was feeling a lot of bumps in this cloud. I was a feminist about all the places that I recognized. But when I drove down my street, I remember that I was... I'm not going to use the job that I had. I was over-held with sadness and I cried. It was quite a while. Well, very good. Did you let it out? Yes. What did it feel like? Um... I was trying to an airline before I was doing it. What did it feel like? Analysis is not feeling. We'll get to analysis in another interaction. This is not a story. Oh. What now will you do? Because that happened. How will that affect your action? Well, I want to try him. Oh, I'm not letting that sit on. Sorry. I intend. I intend. Remove, try, replace with intend. That is power. That is certainty. That is, I don't know when the heck is going to happen. But I will have it happen. I intend. Now, what were you intending to do? Well, I feel that the limiting police system that I got heartily from that environment has been keeping me from following my excitement and my intention is to perhaps re-entering myself and what is more empowering. All right. But more directly, because of this, you will be an excellent father. And that is the point. Oh, the eye wants to forgive your parents. And be the parent you choose to be, having had a blatant example of what you did not, and do not, and will not choose to be. Oh, thank you. You know, one of the benefits of following my excitement is that I've been having. One moment. Listen up. Proceed. One of my, okay, one of the benefits of following my excitement is that I've been having a much greater number of various feelings and relationships in my life, mostly with women. And for the first time, I have a lot of women friends that are just friends where there's no sexual aspect of it, and I feel a very greater level of love like each other, and just this type of thing is having fun. Stand up. Hey. Place your right hand over your head. Pat yourself on the back. Are you patting? Stop thanking me. Thank yourself. Go ahead. It's been very fun. Understand, this is a blatant external reflection that you are now beginning to unconditionally love yourself. Thank you. You know, it's just felt wonderful. It's still will. Yes, I love it. It's celebrating. It's rapidly the same. Oh. The question I have though is I've been studying the concept of animal a little bit from the other side. Look at women that I am attracted to. I seem to project, and they'll reject me, and therefore I feel some anger towards them, and to kind of put some safety net so I don't need to get close to whatever. Are you sick and tired of that? Don't like it at all. Stop it. I want to do the thing I do to other women. You feel the old voice coming up. You say, I'm through with that. Period. Decide. Be certain. Command. Consciously with integrity. What you wish to occur. You're already doing it. Simply extend it in this area. One moment. For now, that will be. For now. But listen up. You will hear more of what you are asking through others. And I thank you. Thank you. Over there, a man. Hey. Question about the experience I had in Egypt. A guy coming through me. Hey. I've been connecting with him quite a bit in the medication. And for sure, through Darryl said that he was someone who was very ancient, or ancient aspect of biologous consciousness. And I always do think about ancient times to tap into his energy. Perhaps as a metaphor. Yeah, exactly. Simple. Can you give me an update on how that has been going for me and depending on how I may add to that? Oh, yes. This is going to be fun. Close your eyes. Picture an ancient scenario and allow Daniel to speak. Breathe deeply and drink from the sea of life. From the sea of love and knowledge. And allow that aspect to come through smoothly. Breathing a wise one. What is it you wish to express this evening? We are ancient. Have ancient aspects of ourselves available to us. Do you have a suggestion for how one may round this knowledge into the here and now? I trust in believing in that possibility. And in that ancient knowledge by remembering. Do you have any idea where you can live? Is there not something else? Oh, thank you. By breathing, by finding a unique ritual or symbol, with tapping into that energy that is unique to you. I trust that whenever it comes to you. That was quite a bit. And I thank you. As you understand each and every one of you what has just been shared. As we have often discussed, your imagination allows you specific access to your totality, specific connection. And perhaps you can say expression of your higher self through physical terms. Therefore be mindful of the symbols that you attract. Be mindful of the symbols that appear in your mind's eye. They do so for a reason. They are triggers. They are catalysts. They will be different from individuals to individuals. Certain individuals will gravitate toward an extraterrestrial symbol. Certain individuals will gravitate toward an angelic symbol. Certain individuals will gravitate toward historic symbols. Whatever it is that truly attracts you is a direct reflection of a metaphor. A identification vibratory energy that will allow you to unfold. So therefore begin to trust your imagination in that sense. You already trust it fine and bandy with what if negative scenarios simply take that same trust and apply it simply because you say so. Simply because you wish now to also allow it to serve you in a positive way. That is one of the reasons you have an imagination to begin with. That is shall we say the meeting ground between yourself and all other aspects as you create within the separations of your understanding aspects. Your imagination is the key. Your imagination is the meeting ground. The imagination of the channel is where this interaction takes place on your plane of existence. From my end it is taking place in my imagination. However I trust you are there. For I trust my imagination. Your willingness to do the same. No different from what I myself do. Not that I specifically am important in any way. Gives you the same effect. If you feel something is there and it creates itself for your imagination as a symbol. That symbol is significant. If you grab that symbol, if you wrap yourself around that symbol, if you keep your eyes open it will pop up all over the place. It will attract you. It will be a barometer. It will be a compass needle pointing you from idea to idea to idea. Till you no longer shall we say have use for the removal of responsibility to a symbol but I do not mean this in any way in a negative way. You are in a reality whereby you express in symbolic terms. Therefore be willing to use the symbols you call forth. Be willing to also allow this individual a walker upon fire as an example of what you are all capable of. For he has directly tapped into an energy that is perhaps on the one hand part of him but also distinct and discreet from him in the way you create your reality. I was in full perception of the message quote unquote prior to its delivery. Perhaps I then shall we say drew certain ideas out but his perception and deliveries of the ideas were extremely accurate. You all have this ability. You can express it in whatever way you wish. If it does not excite you in that sense to go in front of people and channel you can do it in whatever form does riding your bike down the street. Anything. There will be but a few moments remaining to this interaction. One moment do proceed. You had this ongoing conversation about future counterparts. The shore said that Daniel would just be a big person to other energies coming through. Is it possible that I would be channeling these future aspects of my self? Hey. Anything else you can say about that? Have a good trip. Thank you for your assistance. Oh thank you. You have done it all. Tim Allen. Hi. Greetings. I want to. Oh firefly. Many fire people here. All right. I wanted to add something to the introduction to the second half you had to do on the other side. Well colloquially speaking. And I wanted to add to the question of self- Oh thank you. Oh understood. Very astute. Again loving others as you love yourself pretty soon with that you do. And also is prerequisite to expressing the ability to love others. So thank you for the distinction. And I want to share that I'm relocating. Oh thank you. Are you attracted to the area you are going to? Yes. And then the energies that are there. Trust that. Everything will unfold as a red carpet before you. If you concentrate on the excitement you will accelerate the process. Oh right. Um. And I have been in my application experience. And I want to share with you the other friends of mine. And I want to share with you the time to visit and see the people of the family. Thanks but do not be too surprised if in some way shape or form. Perhaps at a distance we take you up on this physically. I am my friend. There is increased activity in this regard upon your planet from our society at this time. In the water of the comet and water that is in the air. Maybe people will save up the energy. Like someone who watches this. Hey go play. Have a good time. Bring a ball. Well if you wish. Oh thank you. For sharing with us your dreams. And your waking dreams. Which to us are one and the same. But we understand you still as a society draw the distinction. You have something to say about the tidal sharks playing your mind. They were only interpreted as sharks. Directly after that dolphin jumps up onto the rock. But what you are perceiving is the hesitation. The fear in that sense that something you do not prefer may occur. But understand you may come on in the waters just fine. Thank you. Oh thank you. Shurrying. Good night. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Hello. Hello. I have a clear intention to find the satellite. This begins a different viewpoint. So find a mind that is suddenly under attack with campus. My name is Sherry. Good timing. There are a lot of our friends that call him as friends. They are very great at that and very exciting. What's going on? That will be one of the options available to her as well. I'm sure that's what she is experiencing. But once she comes home from strong patterning hospital, I would like to go to her and share with her. How I would think why I am her physician. And I was hoping and then present her a copy of this session. And I was wondering if you could sense anything that you need to add that was the answer to her. First of all, compassion is identifying empathically with someone. What you generally refer to and these terms are somewhat interchangeable, but for the purposes of drawing some delineation. Sympathy is in a sense a reinforcement of powerlessness. So you can express compassion without feeding into and reinforcing the option that that individual will have to express powerlessness, victimhood. So be unconditionally loving, be sincere, but do not be insistent and allow the perspective to be very loving and gentle. All right, I understand you may say what is overwhelmingly negative seeming about this. And you will have plenty of time to think about that. However, just as a counterpoint, just to, shall we say, view both sides of the coin, what does this force you to do? What does it force you to look at? And what does it actually allow you to do that you had not done before? This is not the general approach, but it is a valid question. And if asked in an unconditionally loving way, something will come up. Her willingness to look at what it allows or perhaps forces her to do and think about consciously simply looking at that or doing that thing by choice out of preference. Then shall we say, makes the symbol obsolete. This ease is simply an embodiment of a symbol delivering a message. Get the message, then the messenger has no reason to hang around. Deny the message. The messenger rings the bell more loudly, knocks on the door more loudly. Eventually gets a battering ram and breaks the door down. You cannot deny what is within you and you need not deny what is within you for. There is nothing within you that can destroy you. Things you do not prefer, yes. But that can destroy you without your permission? No. So therefore, acknowledging what you are denying does not give in any more power over you and in fact decreases its seeming power over you. Acknowledgement, acknowledgement, acknowledgement. Then you can see what your choices are. Deny one choice and you do not have all the choices before you. For now that will be a beginning place. That's great. Thank you very much. Oh, thank you. Is that all? Yes, that is all. Shutting. Hey, smile. Back to you. Hi. After the last session that we had. One moment. And to you. Good day. Great. Very good. Thank you. And to you. After the last session here, I have a very different feeling from what you could do. Oh, it was heady. Yeah, well, it was heady. So it was a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit. How much did you have to drink? No. Oh. Just checking. Yeah, it was different. Oh, my. I went wrong. And it was some very strange things. I had a slide figure that is one counter. Describe. Describe. I don't know where to. I didn't. So do not describe what you don't know. Describe what you did. Well, actually, well, it was a very sensual dream. Ah. But then it was a big mistake. No, not. What did I miss? And. Oh. By the way, one moment you missed nothing. Do proceed. Oh, I can get to that. Once the group was appointed with the Greenwood, Senator of taken secret. I was getting to know the company. Oh, right. Quite a difference. Yeah. I mean, I don't need it. So. Understood. Do proceed. All right. After that, there was a score of colors that were going by my pterodine. That was pretty much where it started. And it changed formations. And it changed the way it did. Well, judging after the state and then they might decide that they wanted to do the job. So it just helped things enjoy their office. And I did it for real. And they changed what they did. And it just kept going. And I was just, I had a wonderful sensation. And woke up at this point. I was actually awake. I was just a kid. But I didn't sense the game. But I didn't see the game here anymore at that time. And then we'll do as a label. Thanks. Okay. Why will that do us today? Well, for that is all I will share. But the idea is they are rather all right, heady. Is there anything else? Isn't that enough? Yeah. Oh, thank you. Pleasant dreams. Okay. You will see. I assure you. Allow me to once again complement you on the astounding success of this interaction. By maintaining clear intention, it could have no other, shall we say, turnout. This is a simple analogy to your life. If you are willing to dig, you will get what you want. Perhaps now, apropos will be the idea that you always will get what you want. Perhaps not always when you think you should, but always in perfect timing. And as you begin to flow with your timing, you will get a better sense of when things will come about, and they will seem to manifest more immediately with less time. As you acknowledge within the separations that you create, that everything is part of you and pull it all together. You create less time for you no longer need that time to view each and every part. So your perception of time will begin to change. It will seem in that sense that it is flying by. You are creating less of it. But only as you flow with your life and allow your reality to be obvious, re-establish and maintain your clear intention, and you will never fail. I thank you. Did you a most fond and loving? Good evening. Good evening.
