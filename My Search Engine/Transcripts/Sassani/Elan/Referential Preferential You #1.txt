 Greetings this evening of your time as you create time to exist, how are you? Oh thank you. Allow me to begin this interaction with the entitlement. The referential, preferential, you. Now we have discussed many times the concept of your imagination as being one of your primary facilities or tools that enable you in that sense to create the life that you wish. To lay down the temperate, to lay down the model, to lay down the mold if you will, that will enable you to begin to build that life, to be that very life. And many of you in attending these interactions and participating or listening to these sessions on what you call your taste format, have perhaps on some level understood what we have said, have perhaps on some level, oh shall we say the useful list of this idea. But we do find that for many of you it remains just that. A concept, just that a notion that perhaps would be nice if it were only true. Therefore this evening of your time we will participate with you, each and every one of you, in the formation of each and every one of your versions of that referential, preferential you. And again we remind you that your imagination in your society is generally used as a generator of fantasy. Many times in the form of an escape, many times in the form of a preference that you truly feel will never happen. But that is only one side of that coin, that is only one side of the imagination. When in that sense you view the imagination as a tool, you then get used from that tool that is very, very specific, very, very individual, very, very tailored if you will. Therefore once you have created the notion of the referential, preferential you, or perhaps you can say the you that if you had your druthers you would be. In that imagination and together we will form the mold. Together we will form the birth of this you and then perhaps describe some of the other applications for it once having done so. So therefore in your own timing become comfortable in your sense. Now understand that what you are about to create and perhaps for many of you recreate will be something that will, shall we say, stick around with me. Being that it is your creation, no one can take it from you and being that it is your direct extension expression. You will never in that sense need anyone else in order to call it forth. So it is in that sense by its very creation, by its very identification from you, a tool of empowerment that once you have you can never lose and again need no one else in order to express it is part and parcel of you. Therefore in order to again create a conducive atmosphere for the creation of this referential, preferential you and at the same time unify and unify and shall we say that you will not align all individual presence if you will form it out in unison. Keep and loving breath Understand that as you breathe together, call, inspire, conspire and alignment takes place but that alignment also exists within each and every one of you. So now as you do relax, as you do settle in to yourself, blank the screen of your imagination and allow yourself to perceive what you may be called the black behind your closed eyes. Now before we proceed, understand that there is no way to do this incorrectly and in fact your imagination being that that's the screen that you are looking at right now will assist you. Trust that that assistance is part of the very tool that we are speaking of and allow whatever embellishments occur from your imagination to be the exact embellishment that make it that much more relevant to you. Now we will begin by allowing to emerge from this blackness again at whatever pace is natural and comfortable for you the outline of your body emerging from the black if there is something that you would physically like to author about your body, allow that outline in that sense to represent any changes. If you feel you are a bit too thin, then in that sense picture is being a bit more robust and vice versa. In any way, have this outline be the you you prefer to be but do not remove it from yourself, still understand that you are seeing you. As you do begin to proceed against the background of the blackness, the outline figure allow it to be slightly backwards by a blue white line so it stands out that much more and you can see the difference between perhaps the blackness within the outline and the background by that demarcation line of blue white line. Now again, a while what you would call the features, the color, the topography of perhaps worn out the front of the body to begin to crystallize and see the you that you say you prefer to be. For some individuals, this will look exactly like the you you already are. That is just fine. If it does not, that is just fine as well. But again, do not lose the identification that what you are seeing, particularly if it differs a bit from what you see in your mirror, is you. Starting at what you would call the top of your head and standing very slowly downward, allow the detail, allow the fine prints so to speak to crystallize and see a bit at a time from perhaps now the top of your head what you would call your hair. See that hair. How does it look? How is it handy as you say? Being that this is a bit foreign to us. Allow yourself to slowly now scan down to what you call your forehead and eye region and begin to very clearly and discreetly in whatever way that is presented from your imagination. Allow that to crystallize and become more solid, more clear. As you do so, allow this to wash downward, to complete the nose, to complete the mouth and the outline of the chin as you say. See your face, the face of the you. You say you wish to be. Allow now, once again, that scanning to continue downward and allow the outline of what you call your neck to take on more substance. See the lines, see the muscular shirt within that neck. Feel maintaining the focus on the face. As you now have head and neck to whatever degree you have allowed yourself to create it. Now, proceed downward and see the outline of your shoulders. See the outline of where your hands or arms, upper arms, join to the trunk of your body. Continue downward and allow yourself to see what you call your chest, your ribcage area, your abdominal umbilical area. Notice the nuances. Notice the details. Notice the similarities from who you now create yourself to be, and as well if there are any, notice the differences. We will mention before proceeding that what we are suggesting for you to be creating in your imagination is the you that you prefer to be. Not the you that everyone else says you should be. The you that you feel comfortable being, that you know is right for you. Do not allow anyone else's opinion for now to enter into it. It is your projection of who you feel you comfortably are. Not through everyone else's said you should be. Continue down now to what you call your pelvic area and allow yourself to begin to see. Taking form, taking shape, the contours of your upper legs, your knees, your lower legs, and your feet. Now as you say pan back and begin by taking a few steps back from the point of view that you are to see the whole self, the entire body, head, little leg, feet, feet standing there in release against the black background again, back lit by a blue-eyed hue of light. Picture if you will, a road. It can be any road you wish. If there is a specific road, fine. If it is simply black up, fine. Picture now this you being placed upon this road, walking. This is now the you again. You say you prefer to be. So begin to now look at how that you is walking. How that you is standing. How that you hold up or down or whatever your head. See how your shoulders are held. See the language that your body exudes as it walks down the road. Confident assured, an ecstatic joy for simply being, for simply existence, for simply living the results of the choice of your soul to create this life. See that you enjoy simply walking and notice the nuances. As you do notice again the similarities to the way that you walk, but also pay particular attention to the differences. The differences in again the way the head is held, the way the shoulders are held, the way the arms swing, the message, the language that the body puts out. Note what is different about what this imagination is providing you in this reference point, in this preferential, preferential use. And again make note of them. Now imagine that that you walking on this road is coming up to three other individuals having a conversation. It matters not what they are saying, but in that sense you may see that two of them see in that sense to be somewhat serene and one in that sense is somewhat argumentative. Allowing that preferential use to again walk up to this interaction with the three other individuals. Allow yourself to see how you are participating in that interaction. How the preferential, preferential use holds and maintains in conviction that posture and is not in that sense straight away from the center that you hold again itself in a particular way when facing the serene individuals, but also when facing the argumentative individual and pay particular attention to how that you in whatever the specifics of the situation that you are creating handles that situation. Now this is the you you always have said you prefer to be. So I assume that that you would be doing the things you say you wish you would do. So allow your imagination to provide the specific stance and again body language that accompanies this idea and see this use. Feel the admiration for that approach for that approach is representative of who you choose to be. Picture that you now continuing down the road. As you do on what you call your right side you will notice a calm peaceful serene and perhaps colorful scenery on your left notice what you call warfare. Now the you that you truly prefer to be will in that sense perhaps have a similar posture when looking to the right and looking to the left. Therefore analyze as clearly as your imagination is providing your particular reactions from the preferred point of view of that you and pay particular attention to the differences in how that you handled and interprets the situation. Allow that you to now face the serene side of the road having again the more tumultuous side to the back and in perceiving that beauty in perceiving that perfection in perceiving that particular expression and manifestation of your nature. Allow the feelings that that you would have to come to the surface and feel the feeling of sitting in feel the feeling of harmony feel the feeling of unconditional love and acceptance for the scenario that you have chosen to in that sense exist within for the time being. When you truly feel what I am sharing allow yourself to now turn one hundred and eighty degree putting the serene in the back and now seeing what you would call any version of what you call warfare and tumultuousness upon your planet. But notice the following this preferential you this reference point. Feel that same joy still feel that same unconditional love feel feel that same connection. However perhaps is expressing it from the viewpoint well that their story. Not invalidating understanding that that fits as well but it is not representative of the you you say you prefer to be but at the same time you can understand that it serves a function for perhaps other individuals who are still exploring separation limitation negativity and they too have the right and reason to explore but notice the lack of the fact from that scenario and in fact the maintenance of the centered self understanding that the serenity surrounds you as well from the back. A while that you to once again turn facing the front of the road as we have defined and begin once again to walk perhaps again now into a fog whereby there is no longer a discernible difference between one side and the other. As you walk you come upon a chair. Allow yourself to sit in this chair again with a permeation of fog around you. As you feel yourself sitting in the chair as you see that you sitting in that chair. Become that you in the chair now take your point of view and perhaps sit on the lap of that referential preferential you but you will notice that you think into that you and merge with that you. Your view point to shift now from viewing that you to again sitting in the seat of that you and viewing from that you. Understand the following. You are that you. All in that sense that you would need you to represent this is simply to just decide that you are already that you just decide a conscious act. The decision to become. Now that you are creating this notion within your imagination on the stand that in order to do so in order to even conjure up these pictures you must in the moment that you are doing so become the idea itself. Otherwise you would not have the ability to bring it forth you are this you by the near healing and conjuring of this you and experience of this you you are that very you just decide that this is so for you. Now in order to maintain this posturing point of view once you have decided to change as you have. There are merely but two more steps left step number two one being just decide is to trust that you have changed assume the attitude and expectations of the you that has changed. Not the you that wishes to change that is looking for the evidence of why you have not. An accepting evidence that you have not the you that is that you would accept no evidence the accepting of the evidence that it is not that you is the old belief system. The trust in the new you is the creation of the new belief system that now looks from that point of view that now act as that you act and in fact that is separate to act as though you trust that you have changed. That means when something comes along which would seem on the surface to say you have not changed. Understand that when you even interpret I have not changed that is not the new you trusting in the change that is the old you seeing whether you really believe in the change. But you can simply reacclimate reorient your consciousness to simply decide to trust in the change. Allow yourself now to understand that the chair in which you sit is the chair that you are sitting on in this room and as the fog dissipates around you begin now to allow yourself to reacclimate to this room for you have sat in the very chairs that you are. Again at your own pace when reaclamating to your surroundings you may open your eyes. Now once again understand you have changed because you are a conscious creator and have simply chosen to change. The expression of your belief that you have changed is your willingness to trust in the change and act from the perspective of the change itself. You have created a model you have created a mold or a template what we again sometimes call the referential since you can refer to it anytime preferential since you prefer it you. And it can come in quite handy in your daily life as well now that you have given it the substance now that you have called it for. And very simply if a situation comes along it may not but if it does. Whereby you feel on some level that your initial reaction is that a reaction to a situation rather than a conscious action simply first of all note that you are perhaps thinking about proceeding by unpreferred shall we say perspective. See that perhaps you are about to do something that is not representative of who you say you wish to be. Then in whatever way is possible under the circumstances call forth the referential preferential you it now again has substance it now again has mass. And the situation over to that you the you that was standing in that particular way the you that was holding themselves in that particular way the you that when interacting with other individuals maintain that resolve maintain that joy. The you that when moving through the polarity of your particular physical reality negative and positive simply chooses the positive acknowledges the existence of the negative polarity because that is one of the definitions of the reality but chooses the positive and that situation over that you were about in that sense to perform that was not according to your preference to the referential preferential and see with the specifics of whatever the situation is what that you does. Very very simple when you do so that you will surprise you very many times just as perhaps as we perform this particular set of actions perhaps there were some nuances about that you that you had not anticipated. That is what your imagination contains as a tool the ability to bring forth the specific and apply them to a specific situation with this tool you no longer need anyone else is help. Now this does not mean you cannot share and this does not mean that from time to time you will in that sense enlist the assistance of other individuals. But you now have within you everything you need to proceed in any given situation if you will call for an in body and in power that preferred you at first it may seem as a process at first it may seem that well my initial tendency is still the old approach. But the more times that you rather than acting from the old perspective call for the referential preferential you and hand that over the more times you will give yourself the opportunity to see that there is always always a positive choice. And it is always within you obtainable by you at any time if when you hand the situation over to that referential preferential you and see what that you does if you then do that you will get the result of being that you and the more you are willing to do so and only allow your life to be that consciously performed the more that the process will dissolve in terms of seeming like a process you will begin to automatically simply invoke an in body that you without the seeming one step of removal. So therefore this tool if it does initially seem like a process only does so because that is where you are now willing to insert a pause before you act according to non preference. That pause that willingness before acting when you have a negative perspective is all all that is necessary to completely transform the face of your life. And it is also important for you to build up enough of a positive momentum to seem to overwhelm the quote unquote old non preferred negative momentum. So you will be aware of the negative self of walking or running from the negative self but by walking toward the positive self there is automatically a distance from the negative experiential self you will still be aware of negativity while you are on this reality in terms of the experience of the negativity will be through someone else that their story my story is the positive alternative to their story which I validate which is a reality which has the right but is not my choice. I do not criticize it I do not judge the other realities I simply embody my own reality as an alternative as a statement to the universe as a statement to myself as a statement to those around me that this is possible for it is. This is how we live and not because it is us but from our perspective we find this most joyful and wish to share it with you for your ability to participate in the style of interchange proves beyond the shadow of a doubt at least to us that you are eminently capable of what we are sharing. Therefore if you wish you can put this tool back in the closet to gather dust but you can as well call it forth anytime but you will find if you are willing to do so you will no longer after a period of timing call it forth you will simply embody it will be you and as you look into your mirror after embodying these ideas of yourself you will begin to see something very curious occurring you will begin to see the physical you changing and will in that sense allow that change to whatever degree you will allow it will see an alteration in your physical health this alteration for the purposes of what I am sharing may on the surface seem to be nearly appearing but it is far more than that it is a literal redefining and reassigning of the value of your genetic self as well and therefore part and parcel of the transformative effect on your very genetic core as well where your body is a reflection of your consciousness and if you go along with the same sort of consciousness your body maintains the same presentation but when you alter that consciousness specifically if you do so drastically and across the board there cannot be any other effect than that body which is a reflection which is a representation to fall in step to begin to embody the ideas that you now are you need not in that sense do so with what you call anxiety and in that sense your willingness to be who you say you wish to be will simply automatically result in this but in its own timing notice the changes when they occur when they do not simply move on that it will be periods that it may seem to be more accelerated and other periods where it will be less accelerated but this process can literally entirely redefine your physical body anywhere from three of your days to three of your years it is up to you and in that sense if you do not place a pressure upon yourself and allow the presentation of the preferred you you cannot force it then things will perhaps happen a bit more quickly but if you obsess with anxiety you may slow down your own process the alteration of the physical body in and of itself is not really the point it is an effect it is a result in the changing of the consciousness and this will if you are willing to do this take the form that perhaps up till now will seems rapped it to your society well it's not possible many may say but you will show them that not only is it possible but here I am therefore in exchange for your willingness to redefine yourself or perhaps restate yourself if you're already happy with how you are I thank you and as well understand that one of the only universal constants is change itself therefore that is automatic and you need not force anything to change perhaps the forcing has the effect of making things seem to stay the same but your willingness to simply allow and relax and release your reality will then allow that reality to conform through the natural mechanism of change which again is constant nothing need be forced and if you find yourself forcing close your eyes conjure up that you I assume that you would not force you and will show you an alternative viewpoint an alternative posture an alternative point of view that will then give you one more choice which if you choose will be the result of being that preferred you each time you mimic the referential preferential you you are being the referential preferential you and then simply you will drop the designation referential and simply be the preferential you perhaps then a reference point for others who may wish such change in exchange for that willingness I ask you now how may I be of service to you? Sure over there I was just finished reading a very exciting book called the visitors from within in which Bashar has a preface at the very beginning and they're talking a lot about the data they're particularizing and they're talking in my understanding of one of the things that they're saying about these beings is that they are coming here to teach us about fear and we are to teach them about emotions do I understand that well in a sense that will be the result but you proceed I understand that they have no emotions at all that they have been completely bred out and that by breeding with us I mean one of the things that excited me was they said that some of us females they need us to go aboard their ship to rock their babies into their nurture them to show their females how to do this because they can't feel the emotions anymore and in return they're going to teach us about fear and my question to you is in teaching us about fear is it reflecting back to us the fear from within thus the title of visitors from within exactly or they can only reflect back to you what you already can pay perhaps you can say many years ago they can pay no emotionality perhaps contemporary to you right here right now in this room which to me is quite arbitrary by the way you will find that there is the beginnings the stirrings of these emotional natures within these beings now they are in that sense beginning in some sense to derive the advantage in interacting with your society it is not necessarily that they came along with the conscious intention we will scare the heebie-jeevies out of them so they can learn but understand that one of the byproducts of those interactions is the fear coming up in an individual of the unknown of the uncertain of the alien perhaps hidden portion of the self that is what is represented that is what is brought to the surface but then by an individual creating that degree of fear many individuals will simply in that sense choose to continue to create it but many will begin to look at again the beliefs which always result in the emotion that are behind that fear and many again individuals will come to find that they feel powerless in the situation and believe it is happening to them when they present the alternative viewpoints that will obviously since everything is happening from me this is not the only one exception I must have made some agreement to be in this situation I will now see what the agreement is and why I have made it that is a different attitude toward then reapproaching those interactions so the individuals that go through in that sense that that or line or train upon in that sense begin to integrate that very fear and that is the benefit perhaps you can say to you as a civilization it is interesting to me one of the things that I read about in the book he talked about going over the prisons and using the blue beam to take some of the prisoners out because that is a very good situation where people are in extreme fear and they wanted to take genetic samples of the prisoners or something to understand about the fear well to some degree this may occur I was reading that I nobody else in my family is as is as I am but my younger daughter was at the same time that same week that I finished the book she told me that she had a dream of being in our house and looking out the window and seeing this blue beam come through the window which then turned to red and back to blue at which point she went close to the window and looked out and saw this big spaceship with black square windows with gray with lights all around it. Could you comment on that? Well again to some degree it has to do with the reticulum connection that we have discussed and the awakenings or stirring within her that perhaps maybe she does on some level believe this more than she is admitting. Are you barring her from something? Boring her from something? I don't know. She's the only one I can really talk to about this and I hadn't thought I wasn't anyway but I tell her everything all my dreams and all this kind of thing and I thought maybe she was just having this dream because I had told her a lot about what I'm dreaming about but I'm trying to get over this fearful part because I would like to be one of the ladies that nurtures me baby on his ship and I am still too careful I wake up in the middle of the night and I'm still afraid. Well again when you feel that fear. Feel it really conjure it up. Imbue it. Allow it to play out. Then ask yourself what do I believe. When you ask yourself that now what do you get? That I'm not worth it. I mean I'm not worthwhile that I don't deserve it but I'm not good enough to do this. Alright that is one choice or viewpoint within you. What is the opposite perhaps preferred viewpoint? I am good enough and I can do whatever I want. Which do you prefer? I'll be the other one. Do you see the difference in action from the two different presentations of you? Yes. Therefore you have again through the referential, preferential you the template of action to perform. Simply where and when applicable do these things and you will attract yourself in no uncertain terms into an interaction at your own pace at your own time. Can I ask one more quick question? A couple of weeks ago just before waking up I was very excited in my dream. I finally got my husband to look up at this guy and I thought are there any space people in silver uniforms? Perhaps you would interpret it that way. I thought two big long cigars shaped they were huge. I mean that might have covered two or three miles. Two long cylindrical things that were crossed right in the middle. On the end of each one there was a round pond and then over the whole top of it there was a cat that was completely round. Is that a... That would in a sense be representative of a style of mothercraft. Which generally you would not see from your ground but in this case that apart. Would you look like that? In this instance it was not our craft you were perceiving. Our craft is similar though perhaps more log like which flat ends in that sense. Are the Esmasani people a race that has come from a mixture of the native and the earth people? Yes, thank you. And we thank you. Thank you. For though you may often perceive that we have much to offer you you now may understand in no uncertain terms that you have as much or more to offer us. And we are literally your children calling back through the ages to thank you and at the same time perhaps nurture the relationship between the two races that then result in our own creation. Do I have a future life on your planet? You tell me. I don't know. Well when you know so then you will. When you hope though you are in a sense saying you doubt that you do. Be aware of this and be conscious. Make the decision. That is always true. And to you. I have something I want to share with you and ask you a question. Oh. Do you proceed? Okay. Question goes. My friend Emily. I wrote what is an extended notice. I have my eyes on my face too. You can see our light side. You also really want a real light. And you would really try to be. And then I would be willing to do that. And I would not say that I love that you have. And I went into a class that was not unlike you. I know you know what I would like to do. I would like to go into the class tomorrow. So what I would like to do is just in the world of life. That I would like to do the last time that I would like to do. The world of life. The people who came here. The children were there. And there was a larger world. I was interested that I had a large experience in teaching the children before the class. I offered life to play a holiday on my experiences. I had a little more to communicate. I had an experience with the class and the other people. The larger world, the larger world, they asked me to. And I told them. Did you hold it in your hand? I didn't know if I had to. Did something emerge funny? Well, it's just going to be more a lot of incredible and an awesome experience when I say that. I don't think about it. But basically, I would say that the whole experience, when I say that, was really accurate, the moment of using the class and the time of the year, it was a very important part of the experience. Now, to remain grounded and focused, do not remember many things about it. But there will be some, shall we say, openings in the future. I felt that a lot of us, you know, still have to go through and play and play. I put a lot of things to do. I was just trying to get the children to sort of involve boxing for a significant amount of strength. It was very relevant and alive in which kind of feel of color and color. And it just makes me feel like my identity is coming. So the story, the younger, the older time where I was feeling in the center and the older city and some of the people around me, especially now, is including information from having my parents. Right. Um, this program, I have been to integrate and simulate a place in London. I'm wondering if there are, um, more possible structures and a country that is mentioned, something that is really important. Now, I went from there to a circle of light between us on another planet, on its planet, not to go. Well, before you proceed, allow us to remind you about the particular applications of the liquid-like ball that matters. First of all, by allowing the ball to hover in the middle of a congregated group of people, can be three people or more in that sense. You may, in that sense, by suggesting that individuals could just be in tension and desire onto the substance of the liquid-like ball, find that the ball will take on, so to speak, a life of itself. That that will set up a template within the framework of the substance of the liquid-like that will enable, oh, like perhaps colloquially speaking, the inhabitation of that, shall we say, body, by a discrete consciousness. Which can then be interacted with directly through the ball. Does that make sense? Secondly, by holding the chosen ball within your hands, focusing with perhaps your third eye, but also with your other feet, open. You're incension upon the ball. You will find and just apply to anyone who finds themselves so excited, so inclined in that sense, that all particular image, or perhaps objects, or perhaps symbols, will emerge from the substance of the ball. Pay particular extension to what that presentation is, what emerges from that ball, and perhaps in a future interaction. You will expand the content. Do proceed to the circle of mind. Okay, so I was at the beginning of learning something about with the children, I was reminded of the circle in that I was subject to people who were friends in the circle. And then suddenly I was on what was supposed to be a crime, not a, in a circle, or a world being in a circle. I was one of those. And I just wanted to get, are you all, are you still? I'm not. Are you suggesting a lot of, if in the center of the circle was the largest circle of life, are you there with a lot of programming in that circle? Do you have a lot of life? I'm suggesting that you do proceed. What I saw were, were being coming from these persons, to the ball, or to the ball, to the circle. I think it went through. But I've seen a lot of, to the store, I think I was a webinar of my friends. And I felt, I was there, and I feel. This in a sense will refer back to something that did occur and may or may not present itself as a mentor, but in this discrete life time as a crime. You will. And it is purposeful that I am very, and perhaps a bit deceived, so that, again, ideas will serve within you. That will then identify more strongly what I used to say. But understand that you have been, as a child, part of that circle. There is a connection to our society, but there is also a connection to the society, aforementioned labeled for now with the same, as well, in that circle. I was told then that our own part is serious. Perhaps, essence-wise, for now, you may understand and settle into that your body would be completely human. That goes for all of you, Father. Well, I think what this issue is, you would say, is that there was an issue in the United States. You have connections that now are becoming relevant to your present exploration in this world. Therefore, you are now recognizing those connections and creating new connections, as well. There were also tall people at this circle, tall white people. They probably thought it was a tall one. I think the truth was, I'm not sure how it all works. All I know is that it is a circle, and I was being told of sort of my division that we had, that we had seen that circle to bring to Earth. And the ball suddenly became what looked like the Earth in the particular information. And we were standing around constant. And this tall one, the shining one, in that sense, would correspond to a particular gate that many of you, not all, but in being born, have passed through it, that we sometimes refer to as the Arcereic Gate. That would be the representation of that stream of consciousness, so understand. They are not embodied as you in that sense, understanding bodies. Within that sense, be far more of an energy form, but many times the only way you will allow yourself to interpret them as intelligent will be the ascribing of a body. There is another connection there, as well. Since that connection will represent forgetting left, you will begin to understand that the presentation of them in that situation will represent what you will find to be the unfoldment of memory, which also includes that circle as a child. Are you at least clear with the symbols without saying? I don't have the way to do things wrong. But if there is a question, go a step further and ask. You are moving the tape right now. Are the car room dying? In a sense, they are again a presentation representative of the Arcereic energy. Is it the gate? The gate is a consciousness through which many of you pass in being born as a saint that has the resulting factor of forgetting left and beginning to remember who you are. They talk at great minutes with me about remembering who I am. Oh, what a coincidence. Then the person that first comes to communicate with me, it starts to share with me again, the person from the class, and he told me to do whatever, told me that they were a racist people that served the creator and had from the language. Well, in a sense, you all are. They recognize it and present themselves boldly from that process. You can't agree. This particular individual said that they were more of a computer-bank information than a male or female. And that they said I can refer to it whatever as engineer and that they were going to step up my energy. Oh, but do understand that this not only means technological engineers and is as well as post-theological engineers, so to speak. Oh, okay. And he initiated that stepping up of my energy to make confidence in this economy that I could call to the engineer if I was having to do this economy. But you can also take a deep breath, relax, and allow. For the difficulty, as you are wording, is the resistance to the pain rather than the allowance of it. So if you are in the allowance mode, you will never feel or experience what you would consider to be difficult. If you do, simply slow down, take a breath, perhaps invoke that referential, preferential use, and proceed in centered, purposeful, intention, action. The last part of this day, they started talking to me about my dreams for my life here, my vision of my farm, and my school on my farm. And I knew that we wanted to, with some myself playing, you know, a school, I built with children, with people that can have it. And I just think that there are ways of learning much more enjoyable than we are currently utilizing. And that, at least in third, that I would be part of bringing my school. And then perhaps you can take comfort in the fact that you are becoming that you right now. Who, who was the engineer? Who, what rate did people like that? For now, it will represent an ancient race that in that sense was shall we say in contact with your civilization early on tens of thousands of your years ago. That has not in that form been in contact since. And there may be now that you are awakening as a civilization, more interaction with the stream, but for now we refrain from a label. We have not discussed them before. And perhaps you will receive new insight into them for furthering these discussions down the line. Well, I just want to thank you for taking the time. I really wanted to affirm this for myself and from the people and take the risk of believing what I know. Well, I thank you for doing the affirming for you have done it all and have perhaps allowed me to enjoy participating with you. I thank you for that. My unconditional love to you. Thank you. Good evening, dear, are you an actor? No comment. Must will be discussed about this in the beginning of your new year. Your 1993. We do not mean the new year about to come upon you on your November 2nd. What is that about? Well, thank you for asking. We sometimes date you with it. What you have called your all hollow teeth. And your two following days called all souls all say november 1st and 2nd. Are a vestigio shall we say memory of the destruction of Atlantis itself. And will in that sense represent the day before. The day of and the day after the destruction. By putting november 2nd more historically accurate to the new literal emergence of the new. I just told you. What you call Halloween and the next two days. Is that clear? Are you there? Perhaps you may wish to treat and no trick. Is that all? Yes. We thank you. Yes. Just to follow that up. How does the lancans, what they look like? They were human much as yourselves. They were. It consisted of the five, perhaps you can say, races that you now consider part and parcel of your global society. Well, hahaha. That's great. Now prior to that, what you call Lemuria contained seven races of man. Two which no longer exist upon your planet and which there is a high degree of probability will again exist upon your planet. What color there? One was what you might call a blue-pinged race. Which also had connections to what you would call Mars, though we will not discuss that either, to later. And as well, what you would sometimes describe as similar to Bigfoot. What happened to them? One moment. Was that individual priest? No, not at all. But it happened to them. Understand that their particular exploration became irrelevant to the exploration of the other five races. They in that sense went on their way, but again, there is the likelihood of a reconversion to occur in many years down the line. What was the question? Yeah, I think it was probably all of the questions. I don't know, but I'll never mind. Is that okay? He's all right. Oh, well, I'm going to ask about, I have my little adventure into this chamber that I can explore. And what did you discover? Begin yourself from the depth, the chambers and the resonances within you. Where are you? I went in the Antigua. No, it was really a beautiful experience. I went there and possibly I was at night. I slept there in a boat in the water in this cave and you don't know it. It felt like it's really to me. And what I experienced was, I had a target explain except that I came out with the worst telephone work number. And that really was on my mark all the time and I wanted to ask you about that. And I also had some pretty intense dreams when I went home after that. This block? Well, I just, in essence, I was at the entrance of the cave again in my dream. And there was some person there or a dean or some sort. And we had gone back into the cave and they were showing me these, it looked like aquariums in rock. You know, in the side of the rock, it was the sides of the cave, walls and caves. But they weren't aquariums, there was some sort of fluid or electronic, something or information there. In a sense, you may understand that in many ways these chambers will represent gateways or doorways. And in that sense, you are not hearing through the rocks, but into an entirely different reality altogether. And sampling, perhaps you can say some of the light from that reality. That was perhaps what you would sometimes colloquially call a guide consciousness, assisting you now that you were willing to take the physical steps to the real journey within you. Now, I will ask you how this relates to your telephone and your work. I don't know, I think they get better for a lot of better now. Are you, shall we say, satisfied with the work that you do? Or is there something else that would perhaps be more representative of who you are? And are you picking up the phone of yourself, calling yourself to tell you what it is? Yeah, that's what I get all the time, but I never, I guess it's about fear of still not quite taking the extra step to really be the preference. You know, the true self. Then at least enjoy the fear as much as you can. But again, it is just simply a matter of taking that step, which you again will in that sense perhaps create some of the fear, but then step through the fear, rather than leave it static and do nothing. If you're going to be fearful either way, you might as well get moving. Then the fear will in that sense begin to make more sense. Serve you, deliver us message and move on. I mean, the cave was serving me and I got a lot of echoes. I was making some whistle noises. And this is turning with different sounds. And minutes, minutes would pass. 10 minutes later I would hear the echo coming from the rock. And it scared me a little bit, but then I thought it was just open to doors, Jim, you know, let it flow and let it come in. It was not a literal shall we say echo. It was an interdimensional echo, hence the lag time. You will find many such unusual occurrences in that way, perhaps also with light. I had a candle with me and I put the candle in that section of the rock before this happened. So I was definitely drawn to a certain section of the rock. It was a great experience. That's a lot of fun. So are you telling me when you finally moved and did something, you had a good time? Perhaps you can use that as a model. Okay. And perhaps along the way there will be a few worms, but wormholes many times will bridge areas that took a long time to get to. What's very experienced? I had a good time doing it. I'm not sure if it's still there. I have to check on it lately. And can be shall we say access at any time. Again, the chambers correspond to a perhaps colloquially speaking portion within your cell. And by physically visiting that area, you have set up a resonance between the chamber and the inner so to speak chamber. Therefore, if you wish to go there again please do. And many shall we say more unusual things may occur. But you now have a direct telephone line. And perhaps your new work will be derived from the inspiration of these experiences. Something you could advise me on doing when I'm there. I can advise you to get in touch with your excitement and tell me what excites you the most in this regard. Making noise for this thing, having some sort of a ceremony there being, I guess, somewhat shamanistic about it. And that's what my first instinct is. All right. Will you invite other individuals or do it alone? I want to do it alone. I'm off the open drive. All right. Then perhaps initially you can feel it out. Set up the groundwork. Do it yourself. Create the process. Find what works in that process for you. If you hit a dead end, so to speak, conjure up the preferential preferential use. It will take over just fine. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You are. Hi. I'm Lee. Hi. I'm Paul. How you are as well? A few nights ago I was up late just relaxing and watching your table. And the next thing I thought was, wow. You know, I also felt like I went out of my body. And I felt as if that no, I feel like my body is being given information. Somehow I was taking in or receiving information, but I felt very lightheaded. I felt like I was doing a sort of not thing, but I guess that's the terminology I will use. And now I have to for about three minutes. Now, understand from our perspective, you did have an experience you would call out of body. We again remind you though that your body exists within your consciousness. So even when stepping out of that particular focus, you are still within your consciousness. Therefore, you may understand that when shifting your point of view quote unquote from the body, you may immediately feel access to information which is in that sense present in your, shall we say. Surrounding environments that irrelevant to the body itself. Okay. Well, what happened was I felt that also I saw a twinkling of the light in the room at the time as well. I've been seeing a lot of that lately. Particularly late at night when I was real quiet and I have to do to just be alone. And the following day I closed my eyes and I pictured, actually pictured the energy of my body in a seat on board a ship. And there were three red lights above me and there was something going on. I wasn't quite certain what it was, but it sort of felt like I was being shown something or I was accessing something. Well, what did you ask me? I was actually asked that I was being basically, my mind was being in a great way to work on. I didn't have information. I guess a higher level of information or understanding that I was e-channeling at some point. This got to my higher level and I'm not sure what the level is, but no level is what you call your higher level. Direct. You need not remove in that sense responsibility. It is you. You are becoming unfolding into more of your time. Do not draw the separation and you will accelerate the process. What was the... That is what many quote unquote external seeming beings are in a sense here to urge you to do. To open up to lure you into more of your health. Not more of us, not more of them, more of you. Well, I felt a lot of that and I really understand that because I have been going much more bolder into myself a lot. And enjoying that, so I was wondering as to that night, who I was working beyond myself, the ship I was on, the light that I had seen. And I didn't really notice any, I thought something was one person there, but I wasn't sure. The more you proceed. While yourself to understand that that ship was made of you, there is no external idea here. This is all you. Now begin again to keep making the separation and open up into that you and then if there are separate shall we say occurrences, they will simply become obvious. So I just created that whole entirely. Yes. That is a degree of your power. And the degree of shall we say injecting your interested focus as a symbol that you can use. Another question actually, during the physical body. I used to have, well I can say, you know, dermatology calls it like that. Or was it not real? But now ever since I came back from being in Florida a while back, I noticed a transformation of my back that it's clear. It's not. Well you have since that point and perhaps just prior been willing to express without any doubt, without any hesitation, to whoever is present, who you are. Therefore there is no need for the building up and success of releasing from your physical body of the temple. You are doing just fine. And that's your advice for now I think. Before we break over the end. I'm greeted. I was very common when I was getting married to Sharon. I don't know. I can't think of an interpreter. I can't speak. I was nervous. We'll go right ahead. I have a couple of questions. I remember when we had one and we were perceived after the break. My question is when we were talking about November I had a gateway. You had said to me before for everything. And I said like what? You said I mean for everything. You elaborate that. Simply that from November 50 to your March 50 things will unfold. They will be blatantly obvious. You are still a few days from that. Have a good time. So during that time, on the 19th I'm going to be in Cajon, Arizona for 10 days. Well, good time. By the way this gate applies to you all. November 50 to your March 15. A conducive gate for many openings, many connections, many re-establishment. And if you are willing in that time, particularly to utilize the referential preferential use, you will find the result to be 10-fold due to Cajon. And I'm going to be studying with somebody there for 10 days and someone representing who. He said a teacher, he actually, and he might need an extended master in physical form. And I'm going to be studying there with him and I. Well, again, welcome to the moment. Allow whatever comes up to be personal and positive. On some level, your question has been already answered. So proceed to the next question. We were speaking about me starting my own healing school. And I've been doing guidance through my own higher self and through another person who's channeled that that is to be very soon. And I have a feeling that the connection of me going to Sedona for 10 days, starting with this person is going to be the last quote unquote, outer teacher in physical form that I'm to have in a sense. There will be shall we say feedback from your external reality, but perhaps not as much of a reliance upon it and simply the accepting of it in its timing as perfect. I feel some, I feel a statement about this and then I feel some fear about this. What are you afraid of? I'm afraid that I don't really know anything to teach. Oh, well, now understanding that that even within your particular circumstance is perhaps in applicable. What else my easy. I'm afraid that when I channel channeling Alia Otra, the epicon, I've done it a few times with people and this is related. I'm afraid people are going to ask me questions that I'm not going to know. You are not doing the answer. Therefore simply, oh wow, the information. What I can guarantee you from from our end is it will be forthcoming, but that is as much as I can guarantee. What if they ask me technical questions? Then allow to whatever degree the answers come to be phrased in whatever words are available. I don't have a technical background. But very often an entity communicating quote unquote through you in such a way will simply ask for certain terminology. Ask for certain, shall we say, guidelines to be able to then render the answer into language that you do have, but allow that interchange. When you can forthcoming what you mean, I'll be telling a forthcoming element. The information will be provided from our end. That is the guarantee that I give. What you do with it is up to you. I'm not here. So that this is just related to I've been connecting more and more with Alia Otra and it seems that the key by the name that I had to make use yourself and Alia Otra are one in the same interest. One will represent the child spirit. One will represent the adult. Right. That's what I'm saying. I think I don't need to ask. Perhaps I can give a small suggestion. Allow yourself to attract questions that you do not know the answer to and what will happen. That is what will enable you to shall we say develop the confidence that you see. Right. You are assuming nothing will come. I am telling you absolutely something will. Therefore now you can see what you will do with it. Is that all for now? Can I ask one more thing? One moment. Clerky. What I'm teaching in my healing school and what I'm teaching in the division of is related to the message that the information that New South talked about about us being totally responsible for ourselves and healing ourselves. That seems to be what I'm going to teach people. They heal themselves and that when I work with people I just go to their school and talk to their school and narrow back in their school so that this ease and the body can miraculously so it's just disappear. This is the greatest service that you can render and by the reminding of who has done the healing the final icing on the cake of the self-entown. We have. Okay. That's what I'm saying. Before we pause for a short break a simple explanation that my scanning on whether or not to answer another question was the scanning of the individual present who are quite desirous of a break. Therefore, at this timing we will pause for a short break of 10 to 15 minutes of your country.
