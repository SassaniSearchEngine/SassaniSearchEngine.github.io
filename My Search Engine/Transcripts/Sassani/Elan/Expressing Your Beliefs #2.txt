 Alright, I'll say continue sharing. Good evening. Absolutely, you're greasy. I have a question in reference to food combining. I've been reading about the Chinese Dow and I was just curious about the way they combine food for a healthier system as opposed to the way westerners eat right now. I'm having a problem with my stomach though. Oh, one. Understand, first of all, though your society will create general overall agreements that will seem to have consistency that everything, including what would seem to be the immutable physical laws of your reality, are an expression of belief. This is no less true with what you call your food consumption and in fact with your relationship with the various aspects of your environment that you sometimes label beneficial other times will label in that sense, detrimental. Therefore, to be again most accurate, what you truly believe about what you call your consumption will in no uncertain terms affect and create a result of the interaction of these various ideas. Now, therefore, you have attracted to yourself something which you find according to your belief system more acceptable or more shall I say representative of in that sense what you choose to express in terms of your own habits in this sense. Therefore, you will find that it will be beneficial for you, but again primarily through and because of your belief and also as a side note, as a reflection of the fact that as you begin to expand and understand that your reality exists within you, external ideas that you depend upon will begin in that sense to this appeal will begin in that sense to have less significance. In general, as a society however you move in increments or gradients, so what you will in general find as you evolve so to speak from beings that each to beings that do not is that rather than simply going from eating or providing that form of sustenance to not doing so and interacting directly with your environment the gradient will be created through in that sense attracting lighter shall I say what you would call substances to ingest in this way more as you say natural ideas that are less shall I say removed so to speak from what you call their natural state. Does this answer the question? Yes. Is there something else you wish to discuss? No, thank you. Thank you. You will in general find this to take the form of what you call greens, what you will call whitish substances as well and ideas of this nature that are lighter in that sense not only physically lighter but also vibrationally less lighter again closer to what you would call the natural state. Over there, now. Hey. I'm linear and so it would help me to understand a little bit more about this process. I am, my left side of the brain needs to know how would you describe yourself or your being. I would do processing. You have my ears, how are you nourished? In what you would call my ancient past, we did in that sense as you say take supplements as you say food ingestion. However, as you are beginning to in that sense shall I say transform from a more limited isolated seeming type of being to a more expanded being while still being physical. Our transformation is from that expanded physical being into the first stage of being non-physical. So therefore in what you would call my past, we did eat, we did sleep. Now as we begin to explore entering non-physicality and again colloquially speaking since you do not enter it so to speak. The idea is we no longer express what you would call the need for external substance for we experientially understand that the reality exists within us. Therefore our sustenance would now seem to take the form of direct absorption of the energy that surrounds us itself. And what you would call sleep is no longer something that we choose in that sense to experience, though we may enter what you would call a meditative state. Generally that will be for what you would call a few moments at a time. We shall I say express ourselves through the doing and being of our reality. We are very shall I say directly involved in our reality. Physically speaking we have a planet we have as you say bodies. We are as you say, you man if form in nature with a similar configuration as yourself. Though in general we will be five feet of your height. Our skin will be a grayish white type of skin. A little bit more pale as you say. You would perceive us in that sense as being a bit more frail than yourself, but we are in that sense quite substantial from our point of view. We have in that sense large upturned eyes which appear black because the pupil will occupy most of the eye, but they are not actually all black. They are partially gray as well. The males in our society will be bald. The females in our society will have hair. Generally it will be white. You will find that we also to some degree will function with what you call clothing. In general it is what you would call silvery blue in nature. Though not exactly what you would call silvery or blue. That will do as an analogy. Our planet is quite similar to your own. It is approximately 85% the size and shall I say gravity of your own. Though our sun is slightly larger than your own, it contains use of what you call green in that sense. It is therefore hotter. Therefore our orbital path as you say is farther away from our sun. Though our day is similar to your own approximately 25 hours, what you call our year would translate to approximately 454 of your day. Therefore our year is a bit longer. Our act as tilt is not as you say and inclined as your own. It is only slight. Perhaps you could say 3 to 5 degrees. Therefore there is not the climactic changes that you understand. Relatively speaking it is a mild climate and will not vary by many more than what you call 13 degrees of what you would call Fahrenheit approximately in your 70s range. You would be quite comfortable upon our planet. You would in that sense acclimate to the lesser gravity. You would acclimate to the slightly more rich oxygen atmosphere. Though perhaps you would be a bit light headed at first. We in that sense actively explore what you would call the universe, what we call the multiverse in what you call spaceships or spacecraft. In that sense in general if we are as you say traveling long distances and again this is quite colloquial, we will in general have what you call a city or mother craft that will house several hundred thousand individuals and at the same time also then house what you call many scout craft what you would prefer to add smaller craft that are then deployed. The mother crafts in that sense are shall I say from one to ten miles in length. Generally cylindrical in configuration and therefore due to their great size and mass will generally not enter what you say or call as the sphere of your planet. Therefore it will be rare extremely rare that individuals will perceive a shall I say mother craft. There are other societies with smaller mother craft that have been perceived from time to time. Our method of traveling is a bit different than what you might assume for we do not see ourselves as objects in space and time. We understand ourselves as an expression and that in that expression space and time are an aspect of us. Therefore our traveling is not so much moving through time but isolating the variable of space and time in any given moment and then plugging into space and time. And then plugging in the preferred space time coordinate and simply leaving or seeming to disappear from one coordinate and then immediately taking up residence in the next therefore what you call speed of life is not necessary in what you call our mode of travel and understanding that space and time are not two separate ideas but one expression which your scientists now refer to as space time that we can plug in not only the very of coordinate in space but we can also plug in the variable coordinate of time therefore not only do we travel through what you call space but through time as well. Is there something specific you are seeking? Yes, one of the questions before I get from the mother question. You communicate with how it happens, is that correct? Our society approximately what you would perhaps perceive as between five and six hundred years ago perhaps you can say in many ways fell into a collective daydream whereby our communications became solely what you would call tell empathic. Not so much tell a pathic but tell empathic. We all identify with each other and communicate with each other directly. Therefore we are never out of touch with each other and though you perceive that you are interacting with one member of my society due to our closely knit interaction and interwoven nets all the society on some level takes place in these interactions. So why is the thing that you communicate with us how it happens? However your society does not necessarily recognize that form of communication and honor it. Your choice at this time is that your words will be taken at face value. That is how you choose to communicate with each other. That gives you the latitude to in that sense share what you wish with others but at the same time not share what you do not wish to share in many times or denying from your own self. Therefore in being non-interfera then supported we simply honor this. We do interact with you on these levels you would call tell empathic but not all individuals will validate that we are doing so and understand that tell empathic communication is an exchange. It is not one person reading another's mind. It is two beings in such empathic alignment that they literally create similar thoughts at the same time. I have this ability I demonstrate this ability in these interactions but it will always be up to individuals to validate what they get inside. If you are sensitive and allow yourself the access you will find after physically after this interaction as you go about your business certain ideas that we have communicated to you and what you call the mental or psychic play and perhaps for the purposes of a label will simply be there when you quote unquote need or desire it and what I am saying will be more apparent. But in choosing to communicate with you you having made the choice of how you will communicate with each other we honor that choice. Does that make sense? Yeah. Therefore many times I will speak to an individual quote unquote speak to an individual. I will seem to accept what they are saying but will often know that they are either denying their true belief or perhaps again purposefully as you say lie. But I will accept it at face value because you are sovereign beings as well you deserve that respect and you will ultimately let yourself know if you are doing so but it's not my job. Telepathic or telepathic communication is an expression of unconditional love for only does that degree of acceptance allow for such an exchange. I always unconditionally love you all therefore I have that access. When you will share that love back with me you will find you have it as well but you always have the choice not to do so. What you call telepathic ability is very misunderstood by what you call your scientific community for in not understanding that it is an identification and an empathy. Individuals will pose it as a challenge and that does not take any consideration for the actual mechanism and in fact displays an ignorance of the actual mechanism. What did I have for breakfast? It's not something in that sense that you need to know you already know what you ate therefore what you call psychically attuned individual either may simply not need to know that or in that sense will not share it because of the quote unquote challenge involved. Is this in the system? Yes I have one other question. People who have had near death experiences enter another realm and they experience. By the way they do not enter another realm so much as expand their understanding of their existing realm but do proceed. They encounter a realm of light and when they encounter beings of light they communicate as they say telepathic that is there are no spoken words but they understand what the other people are saying, feeling or thinking and it's quite total. And I'm trying to. This is an excellent analogy for how we communicate with each other. Well what I would like to know is if there are any connection between human beings who have near death experiences and are expanded into this, I'm not going to try to describe it and what your society is. Well the idea is this. As you choose to experience being a physical being you choose to create and live by the certain limitations that you create. Now one of the shall I say perhaps you can say skeleton keys to this reality is that awareness of any of the things that we are discussing can change this. But as you continue to have faith or trust in the fact that you are a contracted being not having that ability simply when you transform through what you call the death process you shall I say release that definition and begin to function more on what you would call the natural level of the soul. So therefore it is similar yes to how we communicate with each other but however we do not in that sense need to create that particular transformation to do so we do so during life. You can also but it will in that sense take that you begin to trust the mechanism and again as you become honest with yourself and have no reason to hide anything from yourself you also then have no reason to hide anything from anyone else. And this and only this is the open atmosphere that would allow for tele empathy for many or perhaps most or almost all individuals upon your planet at this time would consider it to be a breach upon what you call your privacy. You reserve the right to exclusively as you say think certain thoughts that is one of the definitions you are exploring. So when you transform through the death process you release this aspect of the agreement and express more of the natural receptivity of what you call your soul. In general in between lives if you are choosing to recreate another life you will still maintain in the in between state some connection or anchor to what you call the earth experience and this is why you do not seem to expand into an infinite being and seem to quote unquote hang around for a while. Is that a service? Answer you as well. If there is some other clarification that you seek please do not hesitate to ask. All right. Answer you. Shut up. When we make the transition from what we call the physical life state. Is there a program? Is there a process? Are there levels of experience that we have agreed to go through? It is very general and very good thing. As I have always shared when you in this reality have a belief you create a linear process, an emotion, a thought and an action before manifesting that belief. In what you call the state you refer to as the transformative death experience you are already a thought form in a sea of thought forms and there is no linear extension. What you believe is what you experience. So upon death whatever you have shall I say assumed to be most likely is exactly what you will experience. This is why some of your religious shall I say ideology are actually literally experienced by certain individuals if that is what they truly believe they will in that sense experience. I guess what I'm asking is I understand it that in from the viewpoint of the simultaneity of multi dimensional reality all things are present now. However from my point of view from the point of view of the individual does one experience a linear progression in thinking and perception in abilities that continually expand and expand his ability to effectively interface with his chosen environment? Well that can be one experience of how you express yourself however sometimes you can simply choose in the next life to express more of yourself and there would seem to be what you call a quantum jump rather than a smooth evolution or again I remind you. In your natural state you already contain it all therefore the idea of growth is nearly subjective from one point of view. If you already contain it all ultimately there is no growth to be asked for you are already everything. More again what you are experiencing in this life from our perspective is not so much a growth process as simply being experiencing directly many of the options available to you simply becomes. Being in any given instance of access that expanded viewpoint or is well let me complete the question or is there a limitation as to what the nervous system can integrate or handle. The idea is that in tapping into it only will you be able to experience what you are calling as your perceptive nervous system is designed in that sense to perceive. So perhaps you will then understand that yes there is some experience which simply would not translate through your physical reality. Well again it becomes quite subjective if you in that sense are conscious in the death experience understanding that what you believe is what you will experience and choosing what you wish to experience there are then no quote unquote sealing rules or tendency all better off and you can't literally experience your totality. Let me ask the question that I am getting in another way. When I am out of my body and have experiences and learning things do you mean in this life or between life or between life. Do changes have to be made in my nervous system in order for me to integrate that knowledge and become conscious of this knowledge and awareness or is it my actual concept of myself that has to expand. One creates the other. You are changing of a notion then automatically is reflected through your physicality. So if you expand your consciousness it would reflect then in an expanded ability of your physical vessel as well. Your body is a reflection of your consciousness not the other way around though you have been taught to assume that your consciousness is a reflection of your body. Therefore for instance you may understand that one approach to changing a perceptive reality that you may have is to physically alter what you call your DNA and many individuals have become fascinated and interested with this idea. However from our perspective it is the long way home. As you change your consciousness it literally even though your sciences do not yet understand it affects and changes your DNA for your DNA is not the model of how things are. It is a reflection a physical counterpart reflection of your consciousness. So you can alter it from either end however the most empowered way to do so is through the thinking then allowing the physical to fall into place but what I am saying is that is the degree to which the change can be rendered right down to what you call the DNA. If we could just go back to a previous question and tie it into this one what about diet and you said at that time as we go through the transformation process that we are we will expect for ourselves food of lighter vibration. Now I did say in general there will be exceptions literally individuals who eat meat on their way to higher consciousness but in general that is a general tendency. The next question is is the taking it of memory for a higher vibration necessary to make that or does it facilitate that transformation process at a physical level. It is not necessary but again is generally a result of that consciousness. So it is not that you have to change the body to change the consciousness the consciousness changes and the body changes. Well that is how what you have already been experiencing again with the reciprocal assumption but your body is always a reflection of your consciousness. That is just as true as the reciprocal therefore again both beliefs exist within you which do you wish to express. I have done nothing and I thank you for the ability to continue to do nothing. I have been thinking about this kind of going out of her eyes and is trying to decide would it be kinder to the dog to put her to sleep now or let the dog hang out for a while. She doesn't want the dog to suffer in shape or form and wants to do what is best for the animal. This is a completely personal decision. In other words it is not the type of thing that would be created upon our planet since we do not in that sense choose to experience any longer what you call this ease and animal consciousness in being a reflection of the sentient consciousness in a planetary system will reflect that. Therefore we no longer quote unquote get sick neither do what you call our animals therefore this is very personal and specific to your own reality. My suggestion and what I would perhaps do given a similar set of circumstances was as always in any given moment follow my intuition and act with integrity. Then the specifics will simply make the situation obvious is what you call the animal physically suffering now. Is that obvious and evident? That individual then has in that sense that decision to make and that would not be something that I would advise one way or another. Thank you. Oh thank you and thank her. And he's on the verge of seeming to get better and then he has relapses. I was wondering if you could tell me is is he going to get better is he going to do well. Not yet decided. However it is no accident that you have been present for the discussion of what you call the death process and perhaps introducing the idea that what an individual truly believes upon what you call physical dying will be one of the most important things that you have been present. And that is not generally understood and accepted by your society. Therefore you do not quote unquote prepare yourself for that process in the way that you create preparation for other processes in your physical life. I ask another question please. Before you do proceed however when we had earlier spoke of the idea that reflections of things from your external reality are messengers attempting in that sense to deliver a message to you that perhaps you have denied. This is shall I say exactly also true to what you call this if you get the message if you allow it to serve you as it is and clean that message and make the change the symbol no longer has the reason to hang around. Number one number two your society assumes that individuals who create this ease do so through what you call weakness and our understanding is that it takes great strength to create such a reality and participate within it. So you need not be the palm what you generally highly refer to as the helplessness of that individual and can perhaps in that sense enhance and reinforce their great strength. Then you are honoring their power honoring their sovereignty and perhaps suggesting that they may wish to allow that symbol to deliver its message rather than continuing to deny the message. Does that make sense. Yes. So it is up to you. Always has been. My other question concerns a young lady that I work with who has been trying very very unsuccessfully to become pregnant and has gone through great lengths to achieve this. Great length great effort. And my question is will she become pregnant. Another paradox only if she relaxes releases and let's go understanding that you are talking primarily about being receptive in such an act reception is not a tight contracted constricted posture. It is an open relaxed posture. One posture is conducive for what you call conception. The other posture is completely in that sense counter active to that. So therefore it is all well and good to have the strong desire but you need not express that desire through panic and desperation. Relax release and do not force but simply allow that is the creative process. Forcing is shall I say counter to the creative process. It comes from a supposition that you do not have the power and must impose somehow yourself upon the world to get it. Do you understand? Yes. That will be a great. Thank you. Andrew. Sure. I have been always fascinated by the idea of arguments. I never thought of it before but only since I've been listening to you. And seems like that's how the universe run. That's how the energy created and things happen. That is how what you would call the consensual reality is created whereby you perceive other individuals having a similar reality. Now technically speaking you all create your own distinct reality but what allows you to seem to be sharing a reality is an overall agreement itself. So there are layers of agreement. And agreements which is not shall I say generally very well understood are very, very, very, veryable. In general there are not agreements which are immutable. Part of the idea of an agreement is that it is a co-created choice and therefore if one of the co-creators changes their mind there is always some form to renegotiate any agreement. So it is what allows your reality to hold together and be compluent but it also can be transformed and altered. And in that sense change to reflect your growth and expansion. Do you understand? Yes I understand it very closely related to self-enformant and creatorhood and I'm trying to figure out how do you know when to not go through the argument and it's part of the. Simply allow it to be as obvious as possible. If someone comes up to you and says you have made an agreement with me to do such and such you will simply know in that moment I yes remember this agreement and wish to do it. Or well actually I no longer am the person to do such an agreement. I understand that I have made this agreement. Allow us now understanding that things are fluid to renegotiate and redefine that agreement. How much control do we have over the agreements if our higher selves have made agreements and we are not aware of them? Well when you are not aware of them they in that sense will not in that sense necessarily seem to affect you. When something affects you you then create an awareness and once you are unaware of an agreement that is all it takes to decide whether or not you wish to continue that agreement in that form or alter it or in that sense reinhance it to conform to your new definition of self. It's about being more and more aware of our interest in this. Well yes that also. Anything else you can say about agreement. Doing what excites you with integrity. Integrity again being your awareness of the integration of all things always takes into consideration your known agreement and therefore again you either in that sense in expressing integrity fulfill the agreement or to make it more effective. Or take the responsibility to vocalize and allow other individual or individuals to be aware that you now desire to change it. That is the extent of your responsibility. And that is an expression of integrity. For getting to remember I also have made this agreement not to remember too far ahead in the future. You have made the agreement to know exactly what you know, need to know when you need to know it not one moment sooner and not one moment later either. Therefore if you know something allow it to be obvious that that is the time for the knowing. If you do not there is no need to create struggle and strife simply the awareness that it is obviously not the timing or you would know. And when you are no longer fixated on something which it is not the timing for that frees you up to see what is right in front of your face your willingness to reengage in your reality with what is available then continue to be in your own way. Then continue the motion in your life. Thank you very much. Is that of service? Yes, ma'am. Are you sure? I was going to ask you if you can make any comments of my near future connection with California. Oh no. Simply trust your timing and have a good trip. Thank you very much. And thank you as well. Shari. Hi. Hi. Mayal then female. This is getting back to the question that I asked you earlier about the entity that I had been channeled. Is that entity going to be a teacher for me as well as whoever I refer to? Already is in that sense a reciprocal teacher and learner with you. That is truly the role of all individuals. It would be completely inaccurate to call me the teacher and you the learner. All interactions contain both if everyone is fully willing to express who they are. That individual for lack of a better term learns from you as well. Simply again becomes more a matter of sharing of co-creation and of your willingness to decide what your understanding of your agreement is and then to either do that or not. It is generally unlikely that individuals will find the need to channel in this particular format that you are witnessing before you. For now is the time of the waking up, now is the time of moving through your reality with eyes open. And therefore you can take the responsibility of channeling without feeling the need to be moved aside to do so. Therefore perhaps it would be more likely that were you to channel in a similar fashion to the channel before you, that you would do so in more of a conscious way hearing the communication as it comes through. Do you understand? Therefore to whatever degree you are comfortable do so. And your willingness to engage the entity through dialogue but also through questions allowing that answer to come through will so to speak prime the pump. Your willingness to apply the information that you get even if it may seem obvious. Do not let the fact that it seems obvious invalidate where it is coming from. Communication start out in the path of least resistance so yes at first you seem to reiterate things you already know. But of the many things that you know these are the things being emphasized and that is more the point. If you dismiss it saying well that's obvious it must just be me you shut down the communication. If you say well that's obvious but of the many things I think I will concentrate on this this must be the communication and then you do something with the communication. You then perhaps you can say empty the chamber so to speak and allow for the next communication. That's something that just takes time to do. Each time you get information and say alright that's the communication you validated as the communication but then perform the action in your physical world your physical beings you will get a result that will take you to the next step and paradoxically also allow and more expanded communication to come through now that you have experienced the results of the communication. Communications only begin as what you would say a message thoughts or words. They end up as an action that you take when you take any action you get a result and that result continues the process. Understand. Therefore just because you are channeling something does not mean that you will necessarily have any more propensity to do that than anyone else in the room it is always completely up to you to do it as well. And if you act upon what you get that is what accelerates the process the quickest. If you talk about it and try to convince other people about it you will slow yourself down. Conventing someone else means you don't believe in the power of your own idea and who you are attempting to convince is yourself. Acting on an idea is the ultimate manifestation that you believe that idea. So therefore once again actions are the ultimate manifestations of your beliefs in a physical world. Understood. We are going to channel away. Thank you. And for you. Finale. On. Greetings. And. Thank you. I am a big servant about a relationship I entered into about four months ago. Oh, more consistent. Oh, for the man. I'm here. Oh, well. Is it a reflection of who you choose to be? I don't know. No, but in one sense I experienced great joy and an affinity and a compatibility and in another sense there is an uneasiness about just the feeling of the secret agenda here or. Whose secret agenda? Not mine. Are you sure? I don't know. Or, you know, inconsistencies. The thing about not even one moment one thing at a time. Look at where you might have a secret agenda. Regardless of whether it turns out that the individual does or not. You are noticing the shall I say subject of secret agenda because it applies more to you at this moment. And allowing yourself to play through that dialogue with that sets you up for the next step. Acknowledgement is your power denial fills what you call the subconscious closet. Acknowledgement empties it. Do you understand what I am getting at? I do. Oh, thank you. Do proceed. I just feel, oh, I know what you are saying there, but can I just go to this other person? Let's say I do, I come to grips with my secret agenda. Then you feel there is a possibility of a meaningful working out, a meaningful relationship here long term or even short term where I say or. Do you? Do I feel it? Do you in that sense as you say reconcile your own secret agenda? Do you feel such a thing as possible? I don't know. Do you intend that it would be? Yes. Do you in that sense attract this relationship to share the completeness of who you are with another individual expressing their completeness? Or do you attract this relationship to make you complete? Now, whether or not you are honest will determine your result. And this can in that sense be rhetorical. You do not need to answer it now. Just look at it, but if you wish to answer it now, you may. I'd rather pass to the moment. When you attract anything from a feeling of incompleteness, that feeling, if it exists within you, will always have a reflection in your external reality. If that is the vibration you are being, that is the reality you will be seeing. Therefore, if you feel I am incomplete and need someone to make me feel complete, only can you attract a relationship that will continue to reflect back to you your own feelings of incompleteness. You cannot escape them. If you are willing to nurture who you are, afford yourself unconditional self-love and forgive yourself when you judge yourself, you will then be acting like a complete person. And then what you will then attract is a reflection of that understanding. Certainly do. This does answer your question, by the way. Is that all? Yes. Thank you. One moment. Proceed. I have another question. Four. Where can you tell it where the human soul is located in the human body? It is not located in the human body. The body exists within the soul. When you expect your pinpoint point of view of a body, it seems that you are within a body. But perhaps for the purposes of an analogy, this is not a mechanically precise model. You may understand yourself again as an analogy. I am speaking of a finite idea and you are an infinite being. But as an overall sphere of consciousness, the minute pinpoint in the center would represent the body. When in the sphere of consciousness that you are, and again this is quite colloquial, play along with me please. You open the eyes of your perception at that point in the middle of the sphere, it seems that you are within a body. When you close those perceptive eyes and open them anywhere else from within the sphere, it seems that you have left the body from that perspective. But technically speaking, your body is a manifestation of your soul. And therefore it would be an accurate and a disservice to a portion, a part of something which is a complete whole, as containing something which it does not contain. Is this too heavy? This is a liberating notion in many ways, for you will understand what you call out of body experience. It is literally simply the shifting of your viewpoint from that point within your whole spherical. And again that is an analogy, consciousness to any other point which then again from that center point seems that you exist outside your body. But your body is your soul, not soul within it. Now does that bring up another question? No, not right now. There will be but a few more sharing this evening. I had to ask you before your definition of cataports. For the purposes of using this terminology within your society, you generally understand yourself in physical terms as a body, a soul that has reincarnated. Therefore you understand you have had past lives that were other reflections of your soul, quote unquote, living in a different linear timeframe, not overlapping the timeframe you consider yourself to live within. Do you understand so far? Counter parts would be when the soul expresses itself as more than one individual in the same life. Okay, I generally, because this exploration occurs at the same time, the reasons for exploring it within the same life are to explore, generally diametrically opposed ideas rather than similar ideas. So many times you will not meet a counterpart consciousness that is perhaps you can say another expression of your soul, and if you do would not necessarily recognize them as such, so different with the focus and emphasis being. Other times you can have that awareness. So counter parts all have the same soul? In a sense, that is another way to put it. It is perhaps you can say concurrent lives, though rather than being one after another happening at the same time as well. So in the present life, if I perceive myself as being a particular person in a former life, that means all my counterparts would perceive their selves as being the same person in a former life. Not necessarily. Again, it will depend on their exploration and the exploration undergone in the quote unquote former life as to whether there is any connection. Yes. So sometimes one counterpart would seem from one perspective to emphasize different path lives than another and would therefore assume to have led different path lives. So also in a future life, I could perceive myself as being not myself, but the personality of a counterpart. Thanks. Now is this at all practical in your daily life? I do not know. But it is a description of one of the ways you manifest as physical beings. Is that all? With I am. Shut it. I have a question from my son, Ashley. He is very interested in Atlantis. There have been many legends saying that Atlantis would rise again. Not literally. Symbolically. And you may understand that your United States in many ways represents a similar pinnacle, though from our perception, with the added choice not to destroy yourself. So therefore it makes it quite a different scenario altogether. Would there be any physical evidence? Well, there already is some physical evidence of what you would call the existence of your Atlantis. Historically, certain individuals have physically witnessed this and is not known in your quote unquote mainstream yet. And will this information be before some stream? Well, it can in that sense be accessed by individuals through what you call your literature now, as far as it's math shall I say. Exposure that remains to be seen. Are you referring to the block that are the parentless city streets that were found in the Caribbean? That is one expression of that idea. Could you tell me another? One that will not be generally accessible due to the very high fluctuation of electromagnetic activity is what you call within your Bermuda triangle. Is there something physically there that... There are certain remnants structures, one in particular, that actually serve to in many ways enhance the natural electromagnetic vortex, and therefore that enhancement has resulted in many of what you have termed mishaps in that area. Is there any way that we would have asked people to have access to that? Well, in your meditative state, directly always, but to the degree that you will trust what you get. In terms of physically, again, perhaps allowing yourself to be attracted to a particular area and then allowing yourself to witness the synchronicity of being there. But again, through what you call your literature, you will already read, if you allow yourself to so attract, about individuals who have already done so. Are you suggesting that if you were in that particular area, if you were receptive to it, that you would see evidence of it, or if you were meditating that you would feel evidence of it, or... When you are willing to validate inwardly is when you would more likely attract external evidence. Looking for validation externally will, in general, prolong your process. Applying an internal validation since, again, the external is a reflection of the internal, then allows the external to follow suit. Thank you. Again, I refer you to your own literature, not though what you call mainstream literature. Though there are no particular references within the channel, I do understand that certain individuals have literally even entered in what you call diving state, what you call remin pyramids from Atlanta. So now that you understand that this exists, perhaps you will attract it. And to you. That was long. Perhaps three. My favorite number. Well, actually, there's so many I have to ask you, but I have to pick up perhaps the most significant. Number one, please, where did you obtain or you and your people obtain your intelligence? And number two, did you construct the pyramid? No. Two number two. Number one, you may understand. You have the same intelligence that I do. Secondly, could you appreciate anything I'm saying if you first contained it, otherwise it would make no sense? So when something, I say, rings true with you. It is because you contain it and are activating it within you. Truly, you all have completely equal capabilities to me in my society. There is one aspect. One idea. One approach, one word in your language, that is the only difference between my willingness to act as my ability and yours. And that is trust. I trust that I know what I need to know when I need to know. I believe this. I completely am convinced of it. I have no doubt about it. Therefore, everything in my reality reflects that knowledge. Your willingness to entertain that you might just know everything you need to know when you need to know it. And trust that implicitly, flawlessly, if you are too utilized in mundane analogy, looking for your keys, a popular pastime upon your planet, and cannot find them, that is not the one time you do not know what you need to know when you need to know it. If you simply understand you must not need to know it at that moment and go about your business, you will find the key. But trusting what you know and conversely trusting what you do not know as being something you do not need to know in that moment allows you to begin to exercise your trust according to preference rather than randomly. Is that too simple? Yes and no. Also, how or what can I do to further, I want you to become more meditative. Trust yourself. This is the idea that I am conveying. Trust who you know yourself to be. Trust who someone else says you should be but who you know yourself to be. Your vision, your literal vision, your symbolic vision is expanding. It is an expression of who you are. Access the individuals who will understand, nurture and reinforce this expansion. Allow yourself to attract that reflection. Do not allow anyone to talk you out of what you know is true for you. Only you are agreeing with someone talking you out of it can give you the effect that you are talked out of it. If you see someone who says you are not, they are not the person to reinforce who you are and they allow you by doing you the service of bringing it to your attention to see in no uncertain terms whether you think you are not or not. Your vision is expanding. Allow that to be obvious. Allow anything expansive to be positive. It is. Do you understand what I am saying? Well I think I will. I think I am trying to digest too much. No, no. If you always know what you need to know when you need to know it, you are digesting just fine. Do not give yourself in digest. Trust what you know. Act upon what you can act upon. The results of those actions will bring you the next set of knowledge you need to know. Create the flow. Get in touch with what excites you. That is why it excites you. Being upon that vibration with integrity once again can only yield a positive result and can only bring the reflection of who you choose prefer to be in this life. All right. Thank you very much. At this time, allow me to thank you all for your willingness to begin to entertain the notion that you contain it all. Because we hear the statement in line, I enjoy your energy. You are enjoying your own energy, molding it in a particular way, perhaps removing it once from yourself, but anything you feel you are creating. Any joy that you think that someone may bring you is simply you activating the joy you already contain using them as an elaborate excuse. But you, you contain anything you find most pleasing. If you do not contain something and I were to share that with you, you would see the channels mouth moving and hear no words come out. Your ability to understand is your feedback that you contain it. When you ask the question, you already contain the answer and to prove it, individuals ask me a question, I answer if they say you're right. Well how did you know? You must have had some idea and understanding that a question is simply an answer, pose outside of yourself for external validation. You may understand that you also contain the answers as well. And your willingness to entertain them and act upon them is what delivers them to your reality. Talking about things is all well and good. It is one of the ways that you communicate. But left to only verbal communication, none of the ideas that we share will do anything but sound nice. Your willingness to apply them is where what you consider to be miracles then occur. Miracles are not the exception in reality. They are the rule and begin in that sense to understand this. For it is no less true whether you choose to agree with it or not. You are the miracle of creation itself. You are not here to be tortured and teased. You are not here to follow a carrot dangling ever before you, never quite able to grasp. You are here to be the best you can be. You are here to explore anything you wish through the unconditional love of all that is. Therefore take advantage of the reality that you have created. You always create your own reality, always. Even if you see or create a reality whereby it seems you are not creating your reality, you are even creating that. That is the degree of your power, but that degree of power allows you to change at any given moment. Change is one of the only constants. Change is natural. You do not force anything to change. That is the natural tendency. Forcing creates a seaminess of things staying the same. Allowing allows the change of creation to manifest. Then you simply define who you are with clear intention. Clarify your desire, clarify your definitions, your beliefs. Apply your deserved ability, you deserve it, and act with clear action. You already do this, and it is now a matter of taking back your power and doing it because you deserve a life of ecstasy. I thank you for co-creating this interaction with me and members of my society this evening, and I bid you all a most fond and loving, pleasant dream, and dream life.
