 Oh, why now say how are you all the evening of your time as you create time to exist? We will begin this interaction this evening of your time with a following entitlement. Density of consciousness. We have spoke last interaction of your time about the idea of, as you say, first through fourth density and at that time did say we would delineate further upon these ideas. Therefore, the subject matter as you say of this interaction will be that idea a little bit more delineation along these lines. Therefore, again, we will begin. The idea before we do, as we have said, is and follows. These particular descriptions are just that. Not in any way shape or form of a law or rigid parameters of existence. We observations, descriptions and in a sense very arbitrary. However, they are descriptive of the idea of different densification, if you will, of the idea of consciousness. All the idea is that within all that is, all an infinite number of experiences, an infinite number of dimensionality. And also, among these lines, the idea is an infinite number of densities. However, within any given framework, there are certain shall we say guidelines. Certain shall we say classifications which are relevant within that particular framework. On the idea of another framework, they may have very little or no relevance, as you say. Therefore, this description of your particular octave, if you will, of its theory shall be relevant to you and may not be relevant to other civilizations, to other ideas of dimensionality. Therefore, we will begin, as you say, at the beginning, the idea of being first density. We have said that this particular identity of awareness is point awareness. Therefore, first density will be represented within the symbol you call a single point. Therefore, that particular branch, shall we say, of consciousness is but that a single point with no other reference, with no other ability to compare a single pinpoint spot, as you would say. We did delineate last interaction of your time that upon your point, a close representation of this idea would be your rock and mineral kingdom, for in a very real sense what you have considered. Inorganic material is no less a product of consciousness. You may feel as though from your present set of understanding that a rock could say does not have consciousness. No. It is a very congeal form of consciousness, a very solidified form of consciousness. And it will be most representative of the idea of point consciousness, first density, consciousness, as you would say in your language. When moving upon and on to the idea of second density, you then, as shall we say, for the purposes again of description, the idea of a second point, thereby being what we will label for this interaction, line awareness. This is an more expanded view from the idea of singular point awareness, for it does allow some frame of reference, some idea of removal or comparison. A second density, consciousness, as you say, would be represented by the animal kingdom, the twine kingdom upon your planet. And the idea is this, by virtue of the fact that we have in a sense added a second point. Again, this is all very colloquial, but you will get the idea. You now have the ability to look back. However, it is limited to simply looking back at the last point. Therefore, this is somewhat descriptive of the consciousness. You have labeled upon your planet animal consciousness. You are not at this time with your present understanding containing the idea of awareness of how this would relate to your plant kingdom. So we shall use your animal kingdom as a more representative viewpoint of second density to explain that your animals doing fact have little or no concern for the idea of their future. They simply exist in the now. However, they may, in a sense, look back at the last point at which they were at. So their limitation in looking back from whence they came, shall we say, is limited to the last point which they were at. And this is the rest of the narrative of the idea of second density. Again, that density does not have the ability, come say, to see but where they are, that point and where they have just been the other point between which you may consider for the purposes of conventionality, a line. And you do add the third dimension taking one singular point, a second singular point, drawing a line between them and then adding a third point. That third point can now view the line. It can view where it is. It can view from whence it came. It can see beyond the idea of the last point within the line. This is a more expanded point and expanded view of consciousness for from the idea of the all-knowingness of all that is. This third point, shall we say, is, colloquial speaking, the first separation. This first separation is again the separation of knowingness, the ability to be self-reflected. In these parameters, in your particular experience of third density, even though you do look back, even though you may reflect back upon yourself, that is still some feeling of being a part of the immediate environment. And, in fact, one of the ideas within that type of consciousness, particularly when just adding the third point from two points, type of consciousness, is the sensation or feeling that you are being part of the environment, not in control of your participation or your view of your environment. Therefore, a third density symptom, so to speak, is the idea that one may be controlled, but one is a product of their environment. When you add the idea of a fourth point or the fourth density, you are now able to see through yourself, through the other three ideas, realizing that it all does, in effect, come from you. Therefore, less limitation. Therefore, the emphasis is then shifted. For, shall we say, the idea that you do create that entire dimensionality, and that is not the idea of as much separation. More again, expanded viewpoint. One of, shall we say again, the characteristic of third density, as we have labeled, is the idea of a time continuum, whereby, again, the present is the result of the past. And the present results in the future. When moving to the fourth density point of view, adding again that other aspect, removing yourself in its sense, from the triangular volumetric experience, you are now able to see yourself from without, and realize that it is all actually within. Therefore, all time is then seen as simultaneous. For the idea of past, the idea of future, in a sense, are still within experiential reality. However, it is all understood to be the idea of simultaneous. Therefore any now moment has total validity, has total reality, has total manifestibility. Therefore, there is no real per se continuum from one point to another. Also then the realization that that continuum is created in order to explore that type of linear, time experience. Therefore, again, you are still physical with any idea of fourth density. But the limitations that you have explored and served begin before, by the way, side, as you realize it is all a product of your own consciousness. When we add the idea of fifth density, the first resultant factor, shall we say, is non-physicality. No longer the need for, as you say, a physical body. In actuality, what occurs is you then view yourself as the dimension, as the dimension itself, one step further removed, expanded from the fourth density viewpoint. No need for physicality. No need for the idea of linear time, although still some understanding of that idea and the ability to interact within the parameters of that idea. You are again in fifth view as the dimension itself. Then moving to the idea of sixth density, you then view yourself with some separation, still some separation, however more expanded from the sixth density viewpoint to include the fact that you are many dimensions and not just the one that you have considered yourself to be per se in sixth. Again, as we do move further away from the idea of third density, there is less of the idea to identify with in order to explain, but this will roughly give you the idea of the different sets in these density. So, sixth to react, as you say, is viewing yourself as many dimensions with still some ideas of separation. When moving into seventh density, as you say, you now view yourself completely as multi-dimensionality. Many dimensions that you are simultaneously able to single anyone out, but able to expedite them simultaneously. In the sense that there are not many seventh density, civilization or consciousness in touch with you at this time, for that expanded consciousness has fairly little, as you say, in common with your civilization, with your focus. Therefore, that does describe the idea of the active that is most close to your particular chosen focus. As we have said in our civilization, we are fourth density transitional fifth. We are about to move into the idea of non-physicality. One of the reasons that we are still, quote, in fourth density, in physicality, is because we enjoy and are excited very much at communicating with other civilizations such as yours. And within the fourth density reality, we are able to do so with some conventionality, with some ability to understand your experience and translate the ideas of self-empowerment that we live in our daily lives to you. That is still, shall we say, some difficulty in translation, but we feel that we have sufficiently been able to communicate these ideas to you. The idea of fifth density and sixth density. We most represented at this time from the civilization you have labeled, and we have labeled also, the idea of serious consciousness. Within the idea of serious, the consciousness that is in touch mostly with your planet at this time is the sixth density version of that consciousness. That is the idea, again, where they are doing themselves as many dimensions, but still with some separation. This does allow that communication upon your planet. That is indeed the civilization that is in touch with your dolphin consciousness. We have told you again, last interaction of your time. That your physical life, dolphin consciousness, as you are, third transitional fourth density. We also had that time said that they had some offshoots into the idea of fifth and sixth density. These fixed density offshoots, as you say, are the ones that have and have been for many of your years in touch with the civilization of serious. Therefore the fixed density aspect of the civilization of serious is most closely in communication with your dolphin civilization at this time. Therefore we will close this idea, and as always during the sharing, if you do require some expansion of any of these ideas, please feel free to ask a closing note again before we do. Open up the idea of sharing. For this has come up many times in your society, not only within these interactions, but within all interactions that we have had with your society. One of the ideas that we hear from time to time from members of your civilization is that what we are sharing with you is but the idea of philosophy. Therefore we will again briefly delineate one way you may wish to view the difference between what is philosophical and what is applicable is to apply it. Therefore, when you are seeking a certain strain of thought, a certain viewpoint, you may say in a sense you are espousing a philosophy. However, when you are acting a certain viewpoint, a certain perspective, then you are affecting mechanics. Therefore again in order to expedient that which we speak to you, you must do just that, put it into action. The only way you will ever be able to prove anything we are saying, and we have said time is gone again, we do not expect nor desire. As you do believe it just because we are saying is to apply these ideas in your reality. The extent to which you will apply these ideas will be the extent to which you will expedient as you say benefit from saying. Therefore again simply do, simply take the trust you already have. Describe your desired reality and act on that idea, giving yourself the validity, granting yourself the deserved ability to manifest what it is that you desire. Very often when individuals in your civilization have deemed that our quote philosophy, quote, does not work. They have not themselves tried it. They have not followed the ideas you have delineated in terms of issuing out limiting belief systems. Very often when you come right down to it, when you push it all the side, when you get down to the most primary limiting belief, you will find one of two ideas still existing even though you are privy to this information, and even though you may as you say listen to it quite often. One that we find generally is you do not believe 100% that you do create your own reality. You do believe you create some portion of it. You do believe that you have some as you say control over it. That is not what we are speaking of. We are talking about literally 100% ownership over your ability to manifest your reality as you desire. Therefore any idea that falls short of this will fall short with the result. Secondly, again, this is nothing new. The idea is do you really deserve that much ecstasy? You have been brought up in a society from your youngest age whereby you have been taught you must earn anything you do yet. Otherwise you do not quote deserve it, very strongly bought into your reality. But as we have said, any of these ideas are simple to change. By simply validating them, obviously the audio ideas. You have experienced not creating your own reality. You have experienced the results of lack of deserve ability. So you may say it is quite simple to grant validity to these ideas. They work very well. But you may now that you have granted that validity, grant equal validity to the ideas that you do deserve it, that you do create your own reality 100% and therefore by equalizing these ideas, simply choosing that which you prefer and again not stopping at that step that is just innocent philosophy. It is then acting as though you believe you create your reality 100%. If you did in fact create your reality 100% and something did come along which was unexpected, you would not look at it as an interruption in your past. You would think well of course it must be part. I create my reality 100% according to my high intention, according to my preference, therefore anything that occurred has a positive meaning that will actually accelerate the process that I desire and not in a sense get in the way. Therefore again take it back to basics, realize that all definitions have equal validity, have equal strength, that all truths are true and you simply get to pick which one you want. Sounds like a lot of fun if you allow it to be. Therefore an appreciation for your willingness to allow us to reflect to you for the first time that which we are reflecting to you. Unrealizing again that your willingness to view any interaction, any seeming repetitive thing within your life as occurring the first time is a fourth density viewpoint in action. If indeed you feel here it comes again you are saying in third density no uncertain third density term that the present is the result of the past. This has happened in the past and here it comes again. Simply by shifting your viewpoint toward the idea that everything is occurring for the first time even if it has similarities you then allow it to deliver the message it has this time as distinctly different from the message it may have had last time. Therefore giving it a real difference and making it in fact not the same at all. And again an appreciation for your willingness to even consider these ideas for you are a bit beyond the consideration stage or would not be interacting with us at this time. We do ask you now how may I be of some of the studio sharing. I have a friend who communicates with John quite often and he has completed a phase of his life and he is entering a new phase now that would involve two aspects. The two aspects were not delineated and what the question is is what should he do to either actively or passively affect the most immediate and positive completion of his controlled phase. Thank you very much. There is one the present is not a result of the past. Have that individual realize that that is just as true as the adverse as you say. Therefore a person who does not act as though the present is a result of the past always views everything as anew. Second phase two everything is synchronicity. Everything everything no exceptions if it is there there is a positive reason for it to be there glean that positive reason then that symbol if it is a quote non preferential unquote symbol will disappear. Symbols do not deliver their message and then stay around the bother you they deliver their message in our own their way. So again phase two gets the message don't assume that anything is an introduction in your past. Everything is part of the past. Everything gives you an opportunity to after paying your preference then act upon your preference realizing that you deserve to have what you prefer and your dues paying days so to speak on over it is up to him it is up to you. You're saying that he then needs to not take any action but rather to be passive in whatever circumstances that he needs to complete that phase will be manifested. No no no no no the idea is not to be passive it is to act as though he believes that. That is a big difference shall we say between the idea of a recognition of syncrenicity and complacency complacency to know the idea that he is allowing something he does not prefer to put it that you wait by not acting on what he does prefer on what excites him with any idea of integrity of that help. No thank you very much continue. He doesn't know what these two aspects of the phase are yet they have not been clearly drawn for you. We have just as you say clearly drawn them. Okay. However I understand that whatever excites him the most he has to take action on but when he doesn't really know in the moment what excites him how can you take one moment one moment from our perspective everybody always knows what excites them. They may create an elaborate scenario where they appear to themselves that they do not but that is simply a matter of not being self-reflected of not being shall we say not being this in an immediate way honest with themselves willing to take the steps to view what is available and to choose what excites them very often because again they do not feel they deserve it and if they identify what excites them they might not be able to get it but that is just the definition therefore again going back to this idea for the first time clear definition what does this individual wish to do simply by hitting this individual down and posing this to them and allowing them to what you say or call soldiers the answer will be there in actuality if you're honest you always know what excites you from a given set of circumstances but again there is a lack of willingness with individuals in your society to explore what excites them for again very many times they do not feel they can get it and they do not want to know what it is that they would like but cannot have but that is simply a definition close me. Why is that about all of us? Are you sure? Well it's not my question I can't really figure out what's going on in his head to try and probe further and he wouldn't answer what he would be. And by allowing those two phases as you say to be the recognition that the present is not a result of the path and that everything is synchronicity act on the opportunities that synchronicity does bring to you and that will lead to more positive synchronicity though being the two phases will be the end point which he does. On that note okay I think that synchronicity presents certain chances, synchronicity speaking he was laid off from his job for four months he found out 300 resumes. One moment. During the time of sending out as you say these resumes was the job that he was as you say applying for exciting to him or was he doing it out of a sense of what you call obligations. No I think some of them were very exciting for him. All right. The ones that he was most excited about did not materialize and the ones that he would create is probably the least exciting is the ones that ended up materializing and it was at a crossroad where you know he felt he had to make a choice in either taking one path or the other and neither of the paths that were presented to him were necessarily exciting but he had to you know take some action. He couldn't just be and still where he was. So of the two least desirable we took. We suggested on here that there were more of that juncture as you say than two possibilities. You are simply delineating the two least pleasant. The worst case scenario and what he did choose that he does not sleep is this individual now happy as you say. No. All right. Then to recap again he had acted upon what has not excited him out of a sense of obligation without clearly defining clearly intending what it is that truly does exciting. Therefore there was no clear message as you would say to the universe to deliver to this individual for there was no clear intention to begin with. The clear intention would have been the third opportunity. So again go back to the first thing we presented to you within our interaction. Our first interaction so to speak with you that weekend. Clear intention it can happen right now. Not that that individual has to quit the job simply get the clear intention back to the beginning stage you cannot go to point B without point A. In a sense you can but that will be another discussion. Thank you. Does that help? We wish to clear up this idea and if there are more questions that you have please continue to ask. Well I just don't see why you have to walk to the edge of the cliff to be able to do I would have to prove trust. You know if you really strongly believe which I do think it is good believe and show aside in a certain direction. You know why you have to get to the edge of the cliff before that is being a festive for that in and of itself is simply a definition. Realize that any individual's reality is determined by what they believe most strongly. Therefore obviously he believes most strongly in the reality and has created. Therefore again allow him to reflect what he must believe to create the reality he is within and then does he then prefer these beliefs. If so continue to create them enjoy your job. If not it is an opportunity to establish again clear intention. You can always use your present set of circumstances to determine what you believe most strongly otherwise you would not be experiencing that set of circumstances. Therefore you can always use your again most presently available set of circumstances to fish out what you must believe. If you are enjoying your circumstance if you are excited by them if they are effortless if they bring to you the most abundant then you are living a life of excitement. If it is any other way shall we say it is time to get back to fishing out and realizing what you still believe that is not in a sense serving you according to your preference. Let that one absorb for a while. If you do because when they follow a question please do not be shy. We wish again to convey to you these ideas in a practical sense and a tale of sense what is usable. Therefore again simply regroup, rephrase, take some time, absorb what we have said. If you can then phrase the next quote logical question we will ask of it. The answers are all there. We do suggest however that it is contained within each individual and you are simply utilizing us as an acceptable symbol but in even phrasing a question you are still solidifying your thinking for you contain all the answers. Answer is simply a question is simply an answer. A little bit differently but it does solidify your thinking. Is there an immediate question that comes to mind now? Then again absorb, do not be as we said, complacent without answer if it does not satisfy you. And if you are all able within this sitting too as you say figure out follow up questions please do share. Alright? Thank you very much. Share it. Hey. Two questions. Hey number one. Everybody understand we transition from third to fourth entity perspective. It is as if you use a symbol one becomes the puppeteer as well as the puppet. Yes I have not the limited image. In a sense it follows the analogy we have made earlier in the evening. Close the evening. Well the question is what are some of the techniques by which this enhanced perspective experience perspective is achieved. If you have recommendations in terms of techniques I am perhaps simply a discussion of how other entities have planets. One more. For the purposes of this interaction what as you say move on to question number two. Okay. The question two pertains to music and some of the functions of music through the transition from dancing to dancing to the specific and third of four. And the question is. Well I would appreciate your comments on the role of music. In a sense they are very similar the idea of being that we more emotionally experience the idea of music where as you do to some degree experience it emotionally but very often more through the idea of your playing senses. We do in a sense create music in different ways than you and that we are able to do two hours realization of our abilities to create our reality to add what you might call different dimensions of experience to the idea of music. So therefore music although it may occur the idea of tonality vibration that is sent by our ears. So to see can also in effect be seen can also in effect be experienced emotionally there may simply be a single tone which is begun by an individual upon our planet that as it does touch each individual that in a sense joins in then creating a larger tone that does resonate outward and from time to time within this type of manifestation of music there may be other harmonics added by members of our civilization going about their business either by the idea of their voices either by the idea of just simple mental vibration also that on what we label certain or an instrument upon our planet that we have described in your previous interactions which may also be added in but in a very real sense you may call it the tone that is heard around the world for it is experienced by all emotionally mentally as well as what you might call spiritually but in the sense it all similarities we are able to hear music as you do but we do experience music in some of the more expanded fashion than you not to denigrate what you have explored that we do know that as you do expand you realize you contain it all and are able to experience you will feel that containment does that help yes can you rephrase your first question yes in fact i was just thinking of that matter okay we're moving into the fourth density or before you continue almost all that we have shared with you our technique ideas of course is for living a fourth density viewpoint you can take anything that we have ever spoken about run it through as we have said your imagination and come up with variances with specific variances that may work better for you for saying but there is no overall one technique other than just the realization i do create my own reality i am one with all that is there is no searching for god without god is within in a most experiential sense for you all god there is no separation the idea of externalizing all that is is one of the concepts that allows you to feel separation the realization that you have never been separated have merely played in a sense an elaborate game an elaborate game of forgetting and then remembering is the doorway so to speak to the fourth density procy my own computer had pretty much popped up the same information oh right basically what you went through the as i was asking the question earlier as soon as the idea of imagination even as i was asking the question i was imagining myself from a different perspective watching myself in the room to ask the question so there it was occurring all right in the whole part that is why you are third transitional fourth you still have a foot in both right does that help yes it does thank you do you have another question i'm really they can see the board as someone else again we have a great position here with us tonight we have a question or two all right shelly i don't know good day i have a question about the curd shaft work i don't know how to put this other than that every spiritual path i study is pretty much an agreement they're all in agreement with the exception of curd shaft it's broad okay um they all are in agreement that there is after life there is reincarnation that they're probably very beautiful to mention when you die that you are actually attending and going higher and so forth whereas in the perjet work the three-inch full of work is that you have to create a body for your soul like creating a subtle body and they say that you will not go on after life unless you have done it or just work to create this body all right but that is simply a view point from our perspective this creation of a subtle body is automatic if you do heavily buy into that work then you may impose upon yourself that framework but there is nothing inherently true or a law that states such person i was thinking specifically about instant movie called ghost in which the hero of movie finds it he is innocent without his body and so he meets another ghost in subway station so he's just having to focus in this will so he can move mad at the mind of a matter of the future and then becomes able to do physical things and it reminds me of the grid yet work so i get a substantial idea it's interesting because some of the grid yet works used to come up in different movies i've seen another one being liquid scy and which another aspect of this very careful against that higher forces are being offered by justice we are being offered forces let it well then we are all right may we share this perspective with you one of the things we have described and shall again for the first time is the idea of that upon physicalized death what you will initially experience is that which you find most likely that which is most strongly ingrained within your belief system if in fact you believe you've been a very bad boy and the dark spirits of the underworld will take you away that will in a sense be your experience however what we have noticed is when that type of negative scenario is in effect way it out it does not remain that way very long for individuals what in that state thoughts are things there is no time lag between a thought and the manifestation and it doesn't take very long to catch on to the idea that they do not creep up that health scenario so therefore there may be the actual experience of these types of ideas in terms of your question have we helped yes um i would imagine that applicable to life in the present in terms of thought if you don't like what your experience and you can just simply change it by changing your belief system let it go so have although within yours design the idea of affirmation may be helpful may we reflect this to you generally when you are repeating something over and over and over and over again you may not always but you may be reinforcing the fact that you really don't believe it that you are trying in a sense to convince yourself rather than just realizing that you may just automatically have that viewpoint these techniques as you say for changing belief systems always begin with determining what is your belief now as you say many times nine out of ten or so that you do actually nail down a belief it is most obvious that it no longer serves you but it does take that process of honesty of realizing what you still must believe of tracing your beliefs and not just stopping at the first seeming limiting belief that he often that is a tri-man limiting belief behind and which you have built up many layers of other limiting beliefs so again simply nailing down that main belief is always a good place to begin well again you realize what that belief is generally you can see that a you do believe it and b it no longer serves you and a matter of fact doesn't even sound as you say that logical simply that when you learn it as a child or whatever part of your development it was serving you it was then serving you but again by recognition of what your beliefs are you may then realize what your preferred beliefs are and simply by wording your new belief by consciously commanding that it is so and then and here's the key without this it goes nowhere per se acting as it is already that way that is the simplest way to change your belief at first it may again seem that you are in a sense pretending but that is the mechanism for change for it if you act as it or as one individual within these interactions have said fake it till you make it you then set up a vibration of in action me new belief and when you are vibrating as the new belief you cannot help but experience the new reality so again by affirming over and over again in general you are trying to convince yourself rather than figuring out what it is you already believe realizing that it is a dated belief consciously commanding the new belief and then acting as if it is already that way and that is as you say the simplest way to do it thank you very much okay very insightful That is the mechanism. But also, I guess you teach them also what is the difference. In a sense, generally you mean that in a moralistic sense, which is at this point, but proceed. We know what you mean. I was wondering, I guess, without a close inertia, how we are trying to do that. I think perhaps we push them and we do them to work with the students. In a sense, however you may realize that you have the ability to change the way you interact with your children. But nothing is breached. Everything is within agreements. Everything that you do, everything that they do, is within their and your exploration of the co-creation of what you have decided together to explore. Therefore, in a sense, nothing can really be wrong. It is all a part of chosen exploration. But that does not mean that you cannot prefer the positive. And then, by being a living example of that, that is the strongest way to teach your children. We have noticed in your society, shall we say a tendency that's characterized by the flame. Do as I say, not as I do. That is not an example, which is why we do have the results you see. Therefore, by being, in a sense, for denting yourself, by showing an individual, a child, as you say, that you can create your own reality. You deserve to have what you desire within the idea of integration. That meaning of integrity, that everything is all one thing. And therefore, because everything is all one thing, there is no need to force yourself upon another, there is no need to harm yourself or another. That idea of integrity. By walking that, in example, shall we say they have very little to Ashley Lauren. They will simply see that is how it is. But realize, we are all teachers and learners. Therefore, you can also learn from them. You can learn from there, as you say, child life fascination. And it can go both ways. By again, denting straight into a child, your willingness to learn from them, you are showing them that you are willing to learn from them. You are willing to learn. Thereby giving them an example of somebody who is willing to learn, and you will find they will then be more willing to learn. And it goes both ways. But they are there equally to reflect on you and attitude and attitude that indeed you have espoused to me at this time. Therefore, you can learn from each other, and you do not have to impose rigid parameters and squelch them as in your society. There is a tendency to do. You can allow them to do what excites them. And at the same time teach them the ideas of integration. Does this help? Yes. Is there another question along these lines? Or are we very fascinated by the idea of your children? One of the reasons, shall we say, of the fourth density mentality or seeming mentality of the children being born upon your planet at this time, is that they are in a very real sense because they are being born within the transformational age, the transformational generation, actually being born with left forgetting, with left of an imposition of the forgetting that you place upon yourself when, quote, reincarnating from one experience to another. You will find the children of this particular generation actually remembered more. They have in a sense passed through a gate on, as you colloquially say, the way to being born upon your planet at this time, one, interestingly enough, as a side note, which does occur from the solute label, after this. It is a gate which many of the children being born in your planet at this time passed through, and it is a unified energy, a unified consciousness, a homogenous, unified consciousness. That doesn't affect allowing individuals to line up before incarnating again, so to see. Thank you very much, sharing. Yes, sir. Good evening. And to you. When I think of transforming from the third density physical to the fourth density, still physical, and into the fifth non-physical, I have mixed emotions. All right, but realize you will not, as you say, progress through these density to you are, quote, ready. So therefore, your mixed emotionality, as you say, is assigned to you that you are still most firmly in third transitional fourths. Well, the reason I have mixed emotions is that in this life, as a physical being, like maybe the rest of the people here, I find much joy and pleasure from being physical. For example, eating, drinking, taking a good shower, making gloves physically, those kind of things, I'm not sure I'm anxious to give up. All right, so realize you do not give them up in any way, shape or form. When you ask us about our civilization, and we delineate to you, these ideas of which you speak being somewhat vestigial, it is because we are fourth transitional fifth. Now you get into, shall we say, the beginnings, co-opically, speaking of fourths, you still are able to experience these ideas somewhat physically, and in a sense only phase out of them as it becomes appropriate and desirable. It is never that any form of experience is imposed upon you. You grow, extend into each density or realm of reality. So again, nothing will happen to you already. And in a sense, the things of which you speak in fourth, co-opially speaking, you may find to be somewhat more pleasant. However, the paradox is you will need, in a sense, to enjoy them in third before even being able to move. That's it. When I become non-physical, let's say, in fifths. All right. I still remember the joy and physical pleasures of fourths and thirds, and long before them again. In a sense, you will remember them if and when it serves. In terms of, quote, longing for them again, no. For if you do desire them again, you are able to read and ascend, experience them. You've never lost in, per se, to any particular density. You are exploring certain parameters that you, in a sense, in your higher self-state, have laid down anyway. So it is all within your actual higher desire. It is not that, as you say, cutting your eye. But in a sense, you would not progress to fifth till you were done exploring. And again, this is along a physical timeline, which in a sense does not so much exist in fifths anyway. It is a whole different perspective of exploration. One of the ideas is you do not feel separation. Therefore, you do not long quote for something that you do not have for it. You have it all. You contain it all. And in fact, you are it all. You are in fifth, the dimension itself. Those of us who die and choose to come back to this planet as third density to reincarnate, is that partly because they really aren't ready yet to support density. That's it. Thank you. Or, a more positive way to put it is you still have a few things left to explore in third. That is all. I see. Thank you. I'm sharing. Sure. Hey, could you speak of the idea of forgetfulness, the function of that is origin, perhaps, its history? Briefly. The origin per se is an nebulous idea. For again, it presupposes a beginning and an ending. And in a sense, that is an illusion. But the purpose, the positive constructive purpose for constructing or imposing upon yourself a forgetfulness is the idea that when you know it all, one of the aspects you are not able in a sense to experience is discovery. Discovering things for the first time. Therefore, you do again play a somewhat elaborate game with your consciousness whereby you quote in post forgetfulness upon it for your all knowing beings so that you can seemingly discover it for the first time. The idea of discovery, the idea of surprise. One of the focuses of this particular realm of experience. In a sense, there is an allergist to the dream that one has mentioned earlier this evening of being in a boat and being surrounded by the idea of fog. Four, there are many ways to look at that neutral voyage. One being lost in the fog. Another being old trusting. I cannot see what is directly before me. I cannot see from directly where I came. That gives you a crime opportunity to trust 100% in the positive that you are going where you need to go. In a sense, you are all metaphorically speaking, robo's in the fog. Four, you impose upon yourself not being able to see what is just in front of you. Since it is all simultaneous, it is actually all there. So you are imposing a fog in front of you. But that is a neutral fog. You can look at it again as being lost. You can look at it again as an opportunity to discover what is on the other side of the fog. Does that help? Very much. We have been discussing Andrew's expanded participation in doing more challenge. With the ideas of workshops and individual sessions and possibly follow interactions, various different possibilities. Other than that Andrew should follow what it takes them the most on that. Do you have any input into what? You might be interested in doing. In a sense, we just trust that whatever the physiological channels they will do upon and within their experience will be within the agreements we have made with them. So now we have no impositions. We have no conditions. This is the idea that if a physiological channel is willing to allow himself or herself from the also channel through females upon your planet, the idea of using excitement within integrity as a game, shall we say, that is the most we can ask. Well, that's what I figured. Now, from our perspective, our willingness is 100% to do whatever does excite any given channel. For we know we would only draw such a channel such an energy to us that would be representative of our vibration we have again, so we trust. It's not that there could be some bad huge channels lying in there because it's mechanics. It cannot happen. Is that another question along these lines? Well, actually, I was just watching your hand movements and your actions. And I just want to acknowledge how much you and Andrew accelerated your integration in order to create that. Thank you very much to simply and out at all. As you say, the channel, losing up a grip of it, relaxing a little bit, allowing himself to express that which is already within him. And in a sense, then giving me so steep the ability to express an more full sense that which I am communicating to you for, as we have said, these communications take place on many levels, not just verbally. From this mouth to, per se, your ears. There is some visual representation. And there is also some, shall we say, communication between different facets of my being and different facets of your being, some of which express itself in what you label your dream reality. Others would simply express itself in what you label your imagination. Again, though, we validate our imagination. With your increased willingness to validate your imagination, you will realize just how much ability you have to communicate with us. For again, what we have always said you all have the ability at any given time to pipe into our street simply that when you do what you get, you validate. The more you do, validate it, the stronger and more pure, so to see. The length does become, the more you say, oh, that's just only me, the more firmly you shut the door. There are individuals in this room right now who have, in a sense, entered into agreement with another member of my society. And upon their willingness to co-create this type of interaction, the corresponding member of my society, what you have labeled, Anima, will, as you say, be part of the bargain. However, again, it requires a willingness for, even within the idea that agreements have been made, that it still we will on the portion of each individual within their contribution to these interactions. Therefore, again, we will live in a fact and assume that the individuals who do, in a sense, need to hear this, have a look still the message without being too selective. Cattle. I have a question, Beshar, about... The idea of a channeling in a nonverbal way, in other words, I have an additional feel that musically I can convey things to people that, you know, would be good, for example, because the way of opening up art, that I can do it for my music, and it doesn't like to be verbalized. And it feels very direction, and it feels sort of like getting at my own individual personality, getting out of the way, the movie was slightly to the left, and allowing something to come through. I don't know if that's... Thank you very much for very adequately describing that mechanism. In a sense, when you are creating, or chowing, music of this type, do you notice that when other individuals are, quote, speaking to you, it is difficult to follow the words. Yes. It is much the same within the idea of this chowing or this interaction. The physiological channel does perceive a sort of age reading it. Whereas he is not able to focus in on the words that are being sent from sight. It is the same idea with what you are doing, which is chowing music. However, where you are chowing the music from, is not necessarily another entity. It is simply other aspects of your own self, what you might label your higher self. But realize, just as you are, part and parcel of all that is, you are your higher self. There is no separation. It is not that your higher self is up there somewhere. You are an extension of your higher self. And within that parameter, that musical parameter that you have laid down within your lifetime, you are directly chowing the music. Directly channelling, shall we say, the emotional vibrational residence of your higher self. Does that help? Yes. At this time, we shall pause for a break of 10 to 15 of your only minutes. At that time, we will resume contact.
