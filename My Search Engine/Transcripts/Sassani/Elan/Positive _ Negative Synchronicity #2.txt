 Why not say before we continue next month's interaction or this month? Will be entitled, desire and allowance to primary mechanisms for creating in your reality. We thank you for the suggestion. Proceed with Sharon. Hey. And who are you? We've had a movie that's pretty popular on our planet right now. Elon called fire in the sky. Oh, what? It's wide for those who do not know. Okay. It's a story about a man named Travis Walt who was working in a national park in Arizona. And some time ago I'm not sure of the exact date it might have been about 20 years ago. He had an abduction or a detainment experience that was pretty much a negative interpretation as displayed in this movie. Well the interpretation displayed is based on a negative interpretation by that individual yet. That's correct. I wanted to ask you about a few of the things that he experienced aboard the ship that took me somewhat by surprise and see in this movie. Oh, what? Perhaps we can shed some light. Okay. After his abduction he woke up in a thing that somewhat resembled a beehive type structure very, very large. And he was in one of the cells in the walls of this structure let's say, and kind of encapsulated in a cocoon of somewhat gelatin type material. That will be in that sense an interpretation and not literal. What you call the high symbol will represent a style of, shall we say, community, perhaps I've like mentality in some senses, but the imposition of the membrane in that sense is somewhat shall I say Hollywood. Okay. And this organic gelatin type material that seems to be prevalent aboard, what would that interpretation feel? There are many different substances aboard the craft. Some in that sense that to the similar description will be used for sustenance. In that sense, again, we are not exactly sure which one you are referring to, but perhaps symbols were again mixed for more exciting presentations. Well, that's possible that that's happened a lot in this movie and also that he may not have any kind of reference to put a label on a lot of these things. Exactly. So there was the perception perhaps in that way of again, and I am being very colloquial, a hive like mentality being translated into a literal hive. But that is an interpretation and understand that most of that individual recollections are by what you have recalled as regressive hypnotism. Okay, one of the other things he experiences aboard the ship is a period that he saw two types of beings aboard the ship. One thing that we are more familiar with that looked more like the zeta type of being, which in my wife's scene in this movie had the interpretation that these beings had also been detained or abducted and might be possibly pleading for his health at one point in this movie. The other types of beings did not look like what we would expect the zeta type beings to look like. This grind has a smaller narrower eyes, more like a human type eye, kind of a rough gray skin, somewhat short. Nothing that I have really seen any pictures of or anything before myself. Before you proceed, understand in general what you term reticulum population will in general be comprised of three distinct body types that are similar inside though differing in coloration and differing in what you would call bodily composition. There is also a fifth rate of beings that we will not name, but the idea is that they also will appear a bit more to you manage and will in that sense very often seem to be in a coordinating aspect of the interaction. There are also understanding no uncertain terms due to the hybridization process taking place many different varieties of the hybridization process with your planet, but also with some other species and civilizations as well. So therefore many of these symbols may have been beholden in witness and will be interpreted again along the lines of least resistance for any individual. In that case, that individual had relatively little or no background to which to compare what he was experiencing. Very good explanation. One of the impressions that this movie gave the viewer was that it is possible that some of the detainments and abductions that these extraterrestrials took part in, that the people they took did not come back. There was a lot of debris floating around the ship like sneakers and broken eye glasses and you know, you know, various dirty debris let's say, that gave the impression that some of the people take it did not come back. This is very rare. However, it does occur and generally for several reasons. One of the reasons will be by distinct agreement from the individual consciously. However, more than not, it is unconsciously the agreement whereby the individual has structured his life upon the planet in such a way to have detached themselves from what you would generally call family structure, friend structure and therefore have unconsciously agreed in that sense to shall I say participate in the interactions from the perspective, all right, or of host in a sense allowing for the comfortable visitation via having other humans around who seem to be calm. I say, okay, well that wasn't really depicted in this particular movie. Well, now understand the individual's experiencing it will have varying degrees of interpretation and if they themselves feel they are being abducted against their will, their interpretation will come from this perspective and they will look and what they see will be the evidence through what they already believe. My own perspective of this alone that I wanted to bring up is that there's a couple of possible different scenarios of realities that could exist in a situation like this movie where it could be his negative interpretation of this experience which he doesn't have anything to really put a label on it or it could be a marauding very negative type of extraterrestrial population that's traveling the universe coming across this planet basically seeing biological material at once taking it in a manner where it's not functioning with any integrity whatsoever, any compassion whatsoever. I mean that reality could exist. Well that reality absolutely does exist. What we are sharing with you is the symbols that you are referring to are not an example of them but may appear from the individuals undergoing the process out of fear, out of happening to them out of negative synchronicity that they would be a representation of such a race. Again though from our perspective that is not the case though we understand fully how that realization was derived. Okay that's what I wanted to see that answered my question perfect on that. One other quick question on another topic about energy on your planet we know we've discussed you harness the magnetic field of the planet for energy. I just wondered if you might comment on if there's any use of solar, photobotage panels on your planet or extraction of hydrogen from water to be used in any kind of a fuel source. In the way that you mean in general though there will be overtones upon the crystalline structures that we grow upon energy templates that in that sense contain invented within them what you would call the circuitry but this is very colloquial an aspect of being able in that sense to also convert and utilize sunlight. So to some degree the solar technology to some degree is utilized but not primarily. You will find in your society however that there has been much progress made in this regard much of this technology is currently being suppressed but you will find it to be an efficient means of harnessing electricity upon your planet in the near future. Okay very good I'm experimenting with solar power myself and having quite a bit of success. One of the things I've been doing is extracting some hydrogen from water itself and not you know just playing with it not really knowing what to do with it so harness that I'm still experimenting but is there any value on your planet or anybody else's planet and using hydrogen as a solution? Well absolutely but in general it will be surpassed in simpler less shall I say dangerous technology. Very good thank you very much. Full planet. Sure. Hi. To follow up on questions as part of the question you said that there are other civilizations that say the reticulum are interbreeding with solar space in a sense. So in the future is did they create a viable hybrid society? Well more than one. Oh so these are the cousins to which we refer. You have perhaps assumed that they would only be of human descendency but that is not all together happy. Those are our closest perhaps you can say cousins. Oh okay what are the siblings they society? Ones that we have not discussed. I'm here looking. She's driving her. The idea will be that in general what we are speaking of will represent society similar to your own not quite member if you will of our association of many societies and therefore it is too early in that sense to make the identification. They still have free will they still have certain choices that they also may make. Okay. Thank you for asking. Would you like a replacement question? No that's okay. Oh thanks. Hey back there. Perhaps you can clarify something for the past. And you're saying if you have a similar action in a similar situation then you should expect a similar result. Well in a sense the idea is to explain individuals will very often perform the same action expecting a different result which is not Mike. But in the very same circumstance the simple performance of even a slightly different action can only cause the creation of a different result. Is there something specific you are looking for within this? I don't see how any situation could be the same and then therefore how could an action be the same if it's at a different timing? Other so. The idea that we were speaking of is positive versus or negative action in a circumstance. So for instance an individual comes along and as you say upon your planet yells at you. You have an interpretation I will assume to be negative. In general not particularly necessarily you but other individuals then yell back and the result in general will be this back and forth thing that happens each time. The first time you when it's your turn don't yell back you get a completely different result and a similarly seemingly similar situation is that clear. Yeah I don't see though in fact how they do that is always true because I think that you know say someone did yell at you and you ignored them then perhaps they would continue to yell but maybe at some point then they wouldn't. I don't see it as being that cut and draw. Oh well that will always be your parag. What I am simply sharing is that if you have a seemingly same old interpretation but do not perform the same old seemingly seemingly action you cannot help but get a different result in a seemingly similar situation. That is the only point being made. If this is not clear please continue. I think it should be but I don't quite get it because I don't see how it could be the same or I could be similar yes but the same. No. Oh I said. Simply substitute similar in the sense. The idea is if you do something different particularly of the opposite polarity something positive you will get a positive result. That is the point. Maybe if I have to see more relevance to me then it would make more sense. Oh if something comes up please share. Okay. Three minutes. Hi Alon. Greetings. I wanted to thank you for popping in on my meditation about a month ago and I have a couple of questions about it. I had borrowed a paper from Andrew about channeling and I listened to it several times and was doing one of the meditations that they have on the take and in it visualize a vod in front of yourself and then visualize yourself as a vod or the technique to I guess become more familiar with. And identification but also being a receptacle. Right. Oh. Yeah. In the midst of the meditation you know it says they tell you to describe yourself and you know I described a couple of physical characteristics and then the next thing that I said was I am where to become one and which was relevant because the vod that I visualized was an Indian wedding vod that has two necks and as I said during the meditation then I could hear you and it was like you were talking to like a radio in my head. Well in a sense you turn the dial and in that way got our frequency. Which was real exciting. It was real neat and it was a surprise. Well it is a two-way radio do understand. Well since then I've also gone into a fairly deep meditative state with a friend present and I know that I was speaking words but and I don't think they were mine but I'm really not sure and I was wondering if you had any suggestions that was just me and enhancing that and like fine-tuning a little bit better. Oh. First of all understand it would be there for impossible to remove yourself from the process it is coming through you. So yes it is your word but maybe perhaps being utilized in a slightly different way. You may wish in that way next time you do such a thing to employ what you call a tape recorder so that you can hear for yourself what is said. For as I seemingly speak through Andrew and you assume you are all hearing the exact same thing. Perhaps you may wish to pull aside after one of these interactions and ask each other what you actually heard. You will find each individual caters what I am saying to what it will behoove them to heal. So therefore even if you allow another individual to tell you what you said it would not be your own interpretation necessarily at all of what you actually think was sent. So therefore the tape recorder in that sense will provide common ground if you will. That simple suggestion will allow you to perform the next step. Okay one other thing about that also is that in this time when I was in the meditation with my friend there. As I got deeper into a meta-to-state I felt I have been concentrating on allowance and allowing whatever happened to happen and I found as I went deeper there was times doing something in me there that didn't want to let go and didn't want to remove this control. What in that sense was it afraid it would find? No I'm not sure. I think it's that fear you've been popping up in love and it's cliched in my life. And simply your willingness to look at it feel it when it comes up and discuss with yourself again similar to an earlier conversation where do I feel I could even be lost to. It will allow you again to realize yourself as the source and you cannot be lost. Okay is that okay? Yes thank you. One other thing I also felt that let me just ask questions. Does it benefit someone in assisting the channeling process to rid the body of very toxins and completely and I mean completely up to you. It is not a prerequisite in the process itself but it one imposes the belief that it is then it becomes so. So for instance our particular interaction with Andrew is completely unconditional. There are no stoic exercises breathing types of eating types of sleeping that we request from him. It is an unconditional understanding and therefore he need not do anything other than have the desire and the allowance for the communication to take place. So you can in that sense be that loose about it or if in that sense you wish to impose a rigid set of standards can do that as well. But when that rigid set of standards seems to be the only way to do it what I am actually saying is that that is self imposed. And when you impose that set of standards it seems like that is the only way but you need not do it. It is not inherently built into the agreement. And because the master will reflect back to you that you are already a master again there is nothing you need to do. One last question about that. Would it be beneficial for me to I think I have been concentrating on the two spirit guides that I have that I have really been actively aware of. Would it exist in any way to just expand that allowance and like whatever shows up shows up? Well it may be that you strengthen the connection to those two but that more open attitude will obviously then yes give you a star-studded show. Oh thank you. Over there. Come in. Greasy. Thank you for coming. I wanted to share some positive synchronous with you. Oh thank you. On the subject. Don't like me. I see I have been interested for some time in writing a book and one day I decided to do it so I was first page. Take the title and that same day a card came in the mail advertising a course in becoming a writer. Oh what? Not an accident. I know. So I met the card in and we did the literature. Now before you proceed synchronous that he presented itself you acted upon the opportunity that's synchronous that he brought. What happened? The card came I acted on the literature came in response to the card and I filled everything out and wrote the essays and what not. I sent that back in and I qualified for the course. So I had saved just enough money to pay for the course and that I had been saving for anything. Just something. It was just the right amount. Also a year ago my husband brought a word processor which never came out of the box. So I took it out of the box and I started immediately learning how to use it which I love to do. And now all of a sudden I'm meeting people who are authors and I see this and I love that I've already sent in the first lesson. I really enjoy it. I love it and I see it as a vehicle, future vehicle not too far future to share the information I'm learning from the S.A.S.A.S. The information that you are remembering from within yourself with a little mudge from us. Let me get that straight. Yeah. Oh. I'm so excited and I'm enjoying everything about it. I see it as my next career because taking care of people I've been doing for a long time. I see sacred equity in the whole thing happening just as it was meant to happen. Oh. So now in other words rather than taking care of other people you will take care of yourself and provide them a means to take care of themselves. We thank you for your expression of the willingness to embody what we are discussing in these interactions. And for the bottom line is it is that simple and your willingness to act upon the opportunity not allow them to fly by in that sense will always have a positive result. Not always in the direction that you may expect but always in the direction to enable you to continue to do the things that excite you. Thank you. I'd also like to share with you the friend of mine who was experiencing cancer. I've been in Florida the whole time since we last spoke and she comes back today and she may be back now but I will say that she was coming back. But the people that are close to her tell me that she's doing really really well. Her attitude is extremely positive. She's having the chemotherapy but it's also playing kind of every day which is unheard of. Not anymore. And I intend definitely to get together with her. Perhaps you will find again the timing to be synchronicity. The readiness factor as you said. But you will find a certain receptivity again maybe or maybe not what you expect but simply allow yourself to share with no insistence and simply because it has worked for you and there's a gift you wish to give allowing them to do whatever they wish. Thank you. Oh. Is there anyone else in this general vicinity with a question? No, I think it's a question. Oh. Now you cannot say you never get to ask. I was thinking. A while ago we were talking about consciousness and we were talking about being and I have a trigger I read in a book that these are a physical organ of a consciousness and another reality and you said that was right. Well that is one way to look at it but they are also distinct in them of themselves in your reality. So it is both. Well what I want to know is are we creating some other reality as part of ourselves. Oh absolutely. You experience your connection to it in what you generally refer to as your dream reality. In fact you are often also and I mean this literally guides for other consciousness and other civilizations other types of densities of reality in that dream. Oh is that all? Oh wait no I would like to ask. Go right ahead. Okay. You know the place that Ken talks about in the South area and I talked to you about. I was thinking for you the word that's the kind of the property. When I went there last week we did a meditation and she said in the meditation imagine another being. I imagined another being and it was a friendly exchange except the other being seems very very agitated and I got a terrible pain in my head. So I decided to imagine the other being is gone. I did. The other being went away and the pain went away and then I thought well now I can hear what the being saying to me and I have the being come back and the pain came back and got a excruciating again. So I had the being go away and I never didn't know what the message is of being. Well to some degree you were experiencing the results of your resistance to your interpretation of that being agitation. I did that translate. Therefore what was your reasoning for assuming that the being was agitated? I was completely perplexed. Oh do you understand that sometimes when interacting with me individuals will interpret my own or perhaps my emphatic nature as being agitated. But yet when then dialoguing with me will understand that I have ultimate patience and am never in that sense agitated. The point is that when they believe that I am they create a particular effect. Therefore perhaps you may wish to view this enter the situation in a slightly more open posture and simply understand the difference between emphatic and agitated. Oh thank you. Shut it. Hey. And to you good day with thank you. I think that was something for the evening. This week we experienced some extreme education and negativity and there was a lot of people laid off where I work. Oh that will always be one way to interpret a transformation. The individuals who interpreted as what a bummer will in that sense create the action of frustration and agitation. Other individuals will interpret it as an obvious blatant opportunity from the universe saying time to do something else. And therefore then giving those individuals the opportunity to do something else they desire. That's what I was looking at and what I want was help and being able to get that message to these people because a lot of them did take it as oh for me. It was what happened to me bad timing. They said they weren't going to do it. There was a lot of frustration and anger involved in it. Were you physically laid off yourself? No I wasn't. Oh. I wouldn't have cared if I were I was or not. Well if you were your shall I say actions as in that sense representing it not agitating you would have been perhaps the clearest example for them. In the meantime perhaps you can simply share what we have said though to some that may seem a bit. Yeah. I was trying to convey the question. Yeah I was saying be me the blessing. The guy you know you're going to be able to go back. Well it is a blessing in disguise if they choose to view it that way. It is a curse if they choose to view it that way. It is simply both. So perhaps that is what you can share that it is one complete whole unbroken event containing all possibilities they get to choose. Yeah. All right thanks. I have a good question. Oh. I was just minding with one one during the night and what I want to know is because the only is ever having surprises. From one perspective. Yes. From another perspective. No. From the perspective of all knowing all things what can surprise you. You already know it all. You've already seen it all. From the perspective of separation and apparent perhaps you can say degrees of amnesia you are a living example of the surprise within all that is each time you are surprised. Yes. Thank you. Oh thank you. Seven. Hey. May I? Thank you. I'll be brief. I'll share. Oh. But I have some direct questions kind of by proxy from Darlene. All right we will allow for one. I'll take the desk. Sorry. Now you do not think this is the one extraneous thing in creation. No. I really. I'll allow for the synchronicity of my allowance of one. I was even thinking about that I wouldn't even be able to get any of these questions in so I was prepared for that. Paul you know one above. I'll be real direct. It's about the chambers and that subject and specifically the ones in the Fairfield area who built the chambers. Can you do that direct? I will be direct to allow you to understand that though they were perhaps in many ways physically built by what you would call early Native American population that the influences on this population and the reasons for the building were shall I say to some degree containing extraterrestrial overtone some of the technology through which some of the building was in that sense formed utilize such technology that is as specific as I will get now. The migration of the druid or Celtic from Europe is one of the influences only and not by any means fully responsible for that manifestation. Let's say on a timeline 500 to 800 AD. Our perception is that they are slightly older but some of the usage that you are discussing would be within that timeframe. In other words after built they were utilized by many different generations for different reasons. They were not originally intended as burial time. No they were sacred. Resinating chambers. On the same line resonating chambers from each one to another creating this circle of communication. That's harmonic. Yes. Then knowing how do they know how to plant them individually physically where to put them. Well this is where some of the influence comes from so to speak above and you will find many of the ancient structures upon your planet to only make sense from the sky. Now we have discussed to some degree what you call your great pyramidal. But what we have not always discussed is the fact that one of its purposes was literally as a marker from the sky. That it did in that way not only enhance the electromagnetic field of the planet but also in that sense the line itself with what you colloquially refer to as the cardinal point. So if I drew them out these chambers out on the map which is the done there is some sort of alignment there or some sort of symbol. Well it would shed a different light upon it I would say. I see. OK and if I may at the end of this interaction just add I want a little home fun with another question that I ended before. May we shall. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I have a part of the book. From Beshar from Beshar from Beshar's tapes I guess. And the part is going from third essence to fourth is the only thing I have to get is that the present has nothing to do with the past. Now the present is not in the present experientially a result of the past. Now what this means is that perhaps in a linear progression what you would call point A may be the point B may lead the point C so there is a seeming cause and effect relationship that occurs. However when you are at point C. B and A no longer have any effect on C whatsoever unless you determine that they do and through your actions then make the connection. So I am not saying that a past may not seemingly through cause and effect lead to a present result. What I am saying and what we are saying is that the present is not experientially affected by that past until you recreate that past in the present. You always only exist right here right now in the right here and right now moment. Five minutes ago has no effect on right now until you say what I am doing right now I am doing because of what happened five minutes ago. Then you create the effect you create the connection and then you create an appearance that is yes a result of that past and I am bound to that past. But if you can understand that each now moment is unique each now moment is complete that you only ever exist right now nothing has any effect on right now but what you say right now what you choose right now. If one of those things that you choose is a rationale or an excuse to perform particular actions because you have done so in the past then there may seem to be an effect from the past but you literally have recreated that effect right here right now. So it is not even an effect from the past it is a recreation of a seeming past in the present in general that past is not even accurately reflective of what actually happened. It is your version in the moment of that past does this make more sense. Therefore if you simply exist in the moment and do not spend that moment reflecting on a perceived past projecting a perceived future you can actually see what's right in front of your face and that is all that matters in any now given moment what's right in front of you as you begin to utilize the tools that are right in front of you perhaps let's say choosing from those opportunities with your excitement and acting on them with your integrity then you create new effects that have nothing to do with the past and as the past becomes less and less relevant actually begin to seemingly lose memory of the past itself for it no longer has any relevance to the present. So therefore a loss of memory in this way will very often begin to occur when you live completely in the now moment. If in the now moment something from the past will be of service to you then you may bring it up as a memory and then you can recreate it in the moment but once you begin to function in the moment the garbage so to speak from the past no longer comes up. Though that makes sense that is one of the differences between living in third density which is the general description of your reality though you are now transiting into fourth and fourth density which is still a physical reality whereby you no longer express the degree of separation and therefore no longer express the degree of limitation and when you in a given now moment bind yourself to a perceived past that is a limitation when you simply act from what is available in the moment that is integration and complete freedom. Do you understand? Yes. Therefore nothing in your past has any hold on you until you say so and when it then does it only has a hold on you because you say this is what we need. Can you use it? Very much so. False. Is there something that you perceive the current in your past that prevents you from being who you are in the present or up till now has seen. Oh then understand that any moment you refer back to that you are recreating that and bringing it into this moment and you no longer need to simply when something comes up ask yourself the simple grounding question can I do something about this right now if the answer is yes do it you're grounded you're in the moment if the answer is no put it aside and see what is there and then choose from what is there perform that action your ground is simply choosing from what is available in any given moment and acting. Oh yes. Thank you. There will be time for but a few more sharing. Shutter. I have. Who are you? Port. As are you all. I believe we are short sharing. Oh. Actually for part and the closest I can go this word I can find for it is a fine. Oh fine. And this is for all of you over there and all of us. It is received and understand is one of the simplest vibrations for us to receive. We say for shining so right. Shutter. In the process of integration the transition that we are currently undergoing we are each and all of us working on achieving a Christ consciousness. Well if you look at it that way you create a lot of work. If you understand that you already are the Christ consciousness and simply be that way. Oh wow it there is nothing to obtain. It is simply the allowance of what already exists within you. You may seem to then not need to create a problem. Every time you unconditionally love yourself or someone else every time you simply refuse to judge from that unconditional love. Every time you render service not at the cost of yourself but also in service to yourself you are being that in action. I guess that was the wrong choice of words. Well it was the perfect choice of words allowing me to demonstrate that. As the planet progresses it is my understanding that groups will form to exemplify the process of integration. Well that will be the effect but it will not be so mindful simply as you become that you attract other individuals of like mind and become friends. One of my questions is I have been doing a lot of reading about the seven rays as a vision written many times. Do you see that this description or what I have to give but is the concept of the seven rays influential on how these groups form? In general it will be more an expression and statement of them though it is often perceived to be the other way around. And that will generally be our perspective in any matter. There are no controlling features but there are features that then automatically express themselves in a certain way once you make the decision. So you can actually affect that in a sense. So you are saying that simply there will be an attraction between those elements that are on a similar range. The idea is when you are unconditionally loving to yourself and others you are simply the white light containing all seven years. How then do you see the process of the formation of groups further the evolution of the planet? Well again they are a statement of the evolution not necessarily cause of it. They are a result of it that then may serve to then reinforce and enhance the transformation itself. But again are more an expression of it. A BIPOC. As people become more aware of this process and in the crisis within them they can be gravitated into groups. Well at first they tend to be the fullest them they can be not feeling any need for such a group or they already feel complete and then the individuals that they attract will reflect that completeness in them back to the individual. So it is not a group that forms a support but is a group of complete beings who then reinforce that that complete. So you say that the groups themselves are not so much to serve as function but well again they then will serve to reinforce the very transformation that is found by being more of a cohesive visible symbol. How would you well unconditionally love yourself and others and keep your eyes open. One of my questions is that is very good. Simply completing the first two courses. I was wondering I guess you answered the question. I saw that there would be a process that each group would serve the awareness of those external to that group at any moment. Well again this is all a massive. Each of these groups both positive and negative comes to each of your individual awarenesses you then have a particular impression. You then have an interpretation. You then perform certain actions based on what you have seen. So all of these groups have subtle effects. The negative groups will attract other individuals still seeking and still exploring negativity while generally at the same time positive groups will view them as an alternative they definitely don't wish in that sense to partake of. So everyone is of service to everyone else. As you have this say separation as groups become positive or negative you're saying that the planet will eventually migrate into two groups one of a positive nature and one of a negative nature. There may be that apparently at first however what will occur and again I understand that this does not jive with your general understanding is that you will literally split off two parallel earth and that one earth will perceive everyone upon it has this negative perspective and the other one will actually appear to embody simply the positive. There's a little more about that particular process of splitting. Both realities are that dissimilar that they no longer would be congruent to each other they literally split off in frequency and each earth perceives itself in its own continuum and does not notice shall I say the split. Simply for instance if you should choose positivity attract a positive nucleus you will begin to see more positive news shall we say as an example on your television and eventually the negativity will seem to disappear into the woodwork depending upon the degree to which you embody that positivity 100 percent. Many individuals will still choose to embody a percentage of positive and a percentage of negative that allows them to exist on a third world that contains both. So then are you saying that that infinite number of earth will then result depending on what percentage of positive or negative quality. Not only am I saying that but I am saying there already are an infinite number of earth and there are already an infinite number of probable past earth as well. This gets very complex from the finite point of view or you are discussing infinity from finite earth. That's why we like asking those questions. Okay. No that makes sense. Yes it is. Even if it did inside would be positive. And even if it didn't I would be positive. And even if it didn't I would too. And you will always rise to the occasion. Thank you. You're welcome. Sure. Thank you. I'd like to hear some time in the city that happened the way I came to the lake. Oh not you too. Yeah. About a week and a half ago my cousin's six year old son was diagnosed with an oignant brain tumor. He was taken into the hospital. Now by the way when you say that listen to the response. Not everyone considers it a neutral symbol but it was a good one. They took him in. They expected the surgery to take him away from six to ten hours and it wound up so they were closing after less than four. It was something that could be aspirated, sucked out, didn't have to be surgeon cut. He was off of pain medication within three days and they see all they got 99% of the tumor out and his prognosis is excellent and I think he's already been released in the hospital. You need not take any of again the interpretations as the way it is and in that sense obviously he did not. Interestingly enough generally humans will attribute brain sucking to aliens but it is your own problem. And suddenly we go to the family in and what not flew out into California to be there and I called a couple days after the operation and it was a real neat experience because their attitude and their demeanor was completely unlike anything you would have expected in a family where someone says brain surgery because they were on the phone saying oh things are great here. We are just so pleased and things just couldn't be better and it was just a real new example of how you can interpret something in a very negative way and expect and probably receive negative results or how you can trust that it is for a reason and trust in timing which was to play a part in him being in a particular place at the time when his cancer was diagnosed and it was really a very surprising experience for me. Oh we thank him for that expression and also for the expression of those in this audience as well that went oh and also then went oh. We thank him. There are other expressions that in that sense do not translate within the positive and negative. One that will in that sense makes sense is a whole that contains the bolt therefore not neutral but is one expression without the need in that sense for the differentiation but still having the ability for receptivity and assertivity. But in general fundamental foundational reality definitions that will vary so far from that will not translate into your reality. And thinking of the... There are literally shall I say and this becomes again difficult to translate but what you would call physical societies with more than the two senses. That will then. We are aware of one that contains what you call a two four. I'm thinking of what you are making and if we see the idea of the base of the pyramid because we are the experience of the polarity of the alien. The top of the pyramid is that what I'm thinking about when I say it feels something. It's like you're getting a fortune. Again that is what you might call the balance between the two which contains the bolt. It is the single point and no longer in that way expressing separation or polem. To utilize your pyramid example. They defend in a mixed sense. Repeat. They defend in a mixed sense. Well in a sense that is one way to view it and where it moves at infinite speeds is another way to view. You are thinking now about things which are arbitrarily dependent upon other senses. Still compared to what moving compared to what. So it becomes arbitrary. Thank you. That is confused you even more. I'm about to say that thank you for releasing so many more questions. This is my pleasure. You are. I have a question about when. Is that the question? When. Right now. The only time there is. I was thinking about when life begins for the human beings. When the agers is for life or when they come from the world. There are many ways to look at this what you would call body consciousness in that sense will begin at what you call conception at what you generally refer to as your style of sentient consciousness will generally enter just after physical birth. Now this is in a sense not at sin stone and will vary but that is the general tendons. On our planet. But then on your planet you say. On our planet there is less of the dichotomy but still a similar range. And in fact you will find that even in the first three years of your infant life there is still a very loose connection of what you call body and soul. It will generally lock in at what you call free. And in that sense really lock in in what you call thirty. Yeah. What's the communication before the child is born. Well as I said there is an in and outness about it is not that cut and dry. But perhaps you may understand that it is not always that you are communicating inward. Very often individuals will express the communication to what they call the unborn child and still think of it in terms of out there so this speaks this all becomes quite arbitrary. The Chinese I believe the Chinese are the Japanese reading to their unborn child and it kind of lets that make them a whole lot smarter. Oh. And there is often a big communication if there is no soul there. I did not say there was no soul there. I said your definition of sentient generally enters afterwards but there is a strong connection between what you would call the soul and the physical body. The physical body will exemplify what you call body consciousness but the soul is still in a sense connected to the body. So perhaps again perhaps I am being a bit humorous poking a bit of fun but the idea is if they are reading to the what you call unborn child you need not assume they are reading to the belly. They are reading to wherever the unborn child will manifest. I am thinking it is coming to me now that the body is in the soul. And your focus of the soul as either being pinpointed in that body or a bit more expanded is what we are to talk about. One more. Is that clear? Yes. No. When you die what will become of your body when you transform and as to what do you do with bodies when they are no longer needed. In general there will be what you would generally refer to though perhaps not in the macabre terms you are used to as an immediate disintegration or decay. From within or something you should do. Well it is simply immediate. Well we are not shall I say queued by responses in the body that it is time. We make the decision we close our eyes we shift our consciousness our body then no longer has a relevance to that reality and will seem to disintegrate. We eventually get to a state like that. Absolutely. Some individuals from time to time have done this. One example is what you colloquially refer to as deep. There are others. Are there any in our life? Well yes but you have not heard of it. Nor are they ones that you would know. But the idea is yes it is a possibility and any time you wish you can simply close your eyes say alright it's time to go and if you open them it wasn't time. But you can be that conscious about it and if it is time you will have a nice trip. I have had an experience like that where I consciously chose not to go and that will also sometimes be the case. You may say alright I'm ready and find out you were not. Right I'd like to ask a question about an interaction that happened about three back when he said that there is a planet or that was my understanding of what he said. There are more than two sexes. Don't we have that on our planet? Well in the sense yes but we were referring to what you generally call the natural indigenous population. Now there are what you would call new cases perhaps you can say examples of general variety but that was not what we were speaking of upon that actual planet. We were speaking of multiple distinct different sexes which again become perhaps for now impossible to explain in terms that would make sense. Physical manifestations of another sex. And to me at this time allow me to thank you all for your synchronous ability to attract yourself to this interaction. Even if when interacting with us nothing is apparently of service to you you will find that we do interact with you on what you create to the other levels and therefore the usefulness of what we communicate with you and the timing and and dispensation of it is an ongoing process and you may just find walking down your street when a car comes by and splashes water all over your clothes that you say this is synchronicity. Ah a land said that would happen and then you will take the positive action rather than kicking the car and burning your foot. Each time you kick that car yes you will hurt that foot so perhaps that is an example of performing the same action and getting a similar reason. We thank you for your willingness in that way to interact with us at this time we thank you for your willingness to open up the many doors within you that allow you to see that it is all one house. One house that you live within one house that we live within the house of all that is we thank you and bid you a most fondant loving. Good evening..
