 I bid you greetings the day of your time as you create time to exist. Anything. And my love. Receipt and responder. What is it you wish to discuss this day of your time? Well, we set up basically so that we could answer Evelyn's question in Florida. She's from Lake Point of Vista and was last April that she presented a question. And we would like to get that cleared up with her so that she has an answer if you can. I would like to date on this. Oh, right. The assessment of there being a surface and at the same time a deep submerged portion to a consciousness would be the place to begin in that understanding that you are one whole homogenous consciousness, not a collection of parts, though you may express this only in the exploration of the idea of parts. Part and parts of what you call health or healing is simply the ability to shift your point of view to express the idea of wholeness. Hence one of your terms holistic. Generally speaking pain, this e and discomfort are caused by the resistance to the idea of wholeness itself. So therefore wholeness one consciousness allows you to know in no uncertain terms there really is no deep submerged portion which must emerge before you can express the idea to assist other individuals through facilitating their own healing. Now one of the things we often discuss is that individuals you refer to as healers, technically speaking, foundationally speaking, do not literally heal anyone else but themselves. All being perfect and total creatives create their own disease, create their own sense of wholeness or health. Now we do not say this so that individuals who have created the experience of this ead will judge themselves for having done so. You do still as a society play the game of hiding pieces of yourself from other pieces, of submerging portions or packets of your consciousness inside shall you say your own consciousness. And therefore individuals who create the idea of disease are in general not aware of having done so and did not do so on purpose with that specific aim in mind. There are individuals who do by the way but that is a different story. But the idea is the first realization that one can be healed is the idea that everything does emanate from within and therefore an individual will at least have the notion or create the connection to the idea that they will have something to do with their own healing process. The healer is a facilitator, a teacher, a coach, perhaps an energy conduit. But the idea being that they really provide the atmosphere whereby an individual will heal themselves will find it more acceptable to create what you call the cure, to create the restoration of health and then often then credit the healer for having done the actual work. One of the important roles of anyone functioning as a facilitator or healer in this particular age of the expansion of consciousness is the idea of allowing the individual to be empowered to know that they have participated in their own healing. Generally at first in the way that your society plays with each other, you may set up the scenario that you will heal them. That allows them to then give their power away to you and then when you facilitate them through your process they then give themselves permission to heal, literally speaking using you as an excuse. So if at the end of that process you were to do them the service of saying, oh by the way, you did all the healing, you are truly giving the full benefit of your service, which is to assist individuals to re-empower themselves, to experience themselves as whole being. And when you do allow yourself to come to the conception that you are a whole being and begin to prove it to yourself, this ease cannot exist in that atmosphere. So again, firstly transform the notion that there is something inside you that must come out, everything you need is right there, right now, always. And if you are willing to say, I always know what I need to know, when I need to know it, you will then zone in or own in on what you need to know and begin to trust what you get, which is hard too, trusting what you get. Each individual attracts all situations in their life, you and all what you perceive to be other individuals as well. And therefore it will be up to you to recognize that as that individual attracts you, you will have something to offer to you. Now being the best you that you can be is being willing to give your unique perception, your unique opinion. Putting that out there is really your only job. Trusting who you are, trusting what you get allows you to be most consciously of service to others but also to yourself. So when you enter what you call an healing situation and your intuition begins to provide you with things, if you are willing to act upon those things, share those things, trust that the very form in which something occurs to you is the perfect form in which the situation warns your participation, then your level of success as you sometimes label it will begin to seem to increase exponentially. Realizing that you are a whole being and trusting what you have to uniquely offer as being the thing that any individual who attracts you attracted you to reflect back to themselves. So for starters that will do. Is there anything else? Well that was basically the excellent question. It is interesting that I had to hear a bit. You took it differently than I had taken the question. It is funny because I took it prior to hand-on healing that she was going to go to a healer. And I think you addressed it more as that she was going to be through my hands-on healing. She is also the healing. Yes. But it is both. Yes. The other idea is that as you have brought forward, switching the positions in this instance allows her to see that any external source that she will act in order to achieve a cure will truly only wind up being her willingness to allow herself to see herself as a whole being and to allow herself to heal herself whether anyone else's hands are on or not. Which kind of gives her a little segue into the question that I was going to add more at the end but I can relate more now. No one. Because I've been working with playing with the idea of the blue-green algae and getting back into seeing this nutritional bio-chemical support of the body. Now I know ultimately that the opportunity is belief. And what you could believe is when I first started doing this, I had to look at me when my four beliefs are. And yet I do contain belief and do operate in my life. And I have to look at the visual upon your planet. The map consciousness expresses itself with the understanding that external sustenance must be forward coming to sustain yourself in this reality. Therefore working within what you perhaps will refer to as the natural confines of that subject, what sources can I access that are relatively natural is still a step toward expanding away from that concept. When you exist as an energy being, the exchange will be far less concrete. The exchange will be far less apparent. And the understanding that you do actually create your own sustenance from within will be more obvious. However, for now, in the gradient way that your society allows itself to expand, the tendency toward a more natural idea is an extension in and of itself. That's why this really caught my attention, was that it is harvest system, a totally natural source with such a broad range of like, to build the body. But now I'm just reading that there's two other things that have come to my attention is that the five D.L.G. is a post-ante office, and one I was throwing right now is post-inageable. That's the problem being specific pie-barred with harvest system, and the other one being co-impressed. You can, which is also called the history of the indigenous. Specifically speaking, they are what you are referring to as supplements. So you are still supplementing your system, but they can function, again, depending upon your belief, in a beneficial way, where it will allow you for the expansion, which generally will be to the point where supplement is no longer necessary. That you are a complete being and do not need anything to supplement your energy, or supplement your consciousness. You are already everything. You contain the idea of supplement as well. One of the ideas I had is that you take triangle by applying body spirits, similar to the airpiece of the physical reality of communication with the mind, because it is that when you bring up the biological sports, you are facing it out and the structure that you need it. It also can allow you to bring up the conscious and spirit. There is no need to minimize the idea of the characteristics of a belief. Once you believe that, once you commit to that, once you decide that, it is true. So it is unquestionably so that you can experience it in the way that you are sharing. It is true for you. So we will go on. We are going to questions from William. True question. We are going nowhere at home. We are already everywhere. You did quickly. If you wish to nail it. So, you said this reading in the club. And I will read something like, as you know, I am holding down the intro about three languages for my book. That, in definition, a vow of language for the game of life. I am so familiar with the vow of a type of the essay of the consciousness. I am also including... By the way, only suggested. Only to look at it from all angles. Not as a rigid rule to the vow. But simply as the concept, play with it. Be willing to be spontaneous. Be willing to turn upside down. Be willing to look at things from all angles. Not again as a demand. Not again as a requisite or prerequisite. But simply as a suggestion. To get around all angles. Duplacy. But I... They've also included the visual imagery blocks and mandala. As you say, it's all one thing. Do you have any new coaching or questions concerning my mission? The only suggestion to facilitate the grounding of the information is to simply remain as grounded as possible about it. Which means requesting to be aware of opportunities. Being receptive to being aware of opportunities. And immediate engaging of your activities when an opportunity becomes apparent. Acting on opportunity. First again, setting up the reception. Allowing for the process of the permission. I wish to attract opportunities. Though not at that point the end of the process. That is the beginning of the process. The midpoint again in the process would be the idea that the moment the opportunity presents itself. That timing is very significant. And that that would be the time to as they say in your society, land with both feet running and do not. It would not be perceived in that situation. That the steps. One more. Need the effortful and laborious. But simply that the opportunity presents itself behind the recognition of the opportunity is the inspiration, the motivation to act upon us. Similar to one of the other questions was the perception of the internet and the computer asset and the opportunity to sail on the internet. Well we have spoken this before. The very idea of global interlinking in whatever form it takes. That being one is one of the most blatant signs that your society is ready to expand the boundaries of its consciousness. Beginning to be shall I say favorable to the idea of spreading out. Of being aware of that much more of itself individually society. So how an individual engages in that structure will be completely up to that individual. The idea of doing so with excitement once again and integrity will yield a beneficial result according to the person's willingness to commit to that idea. So it is very exciting. But it has been going on as you say for quite some time. It is not a new thing. As it becomes new to each individual and their ability to begin to act within that structure and created. You will however see an exponential increase in the expansion of individual consciousness upon your planet. It is indicative of a threshold of consciousness. A physical reflection of the very creative. Still again, on a grave. Your technologies will continue to combine themselves. The end product, the result being the ability to be in touch with anyone anywhere on the planet. Which is again a rudimentary introduction to telepathic or telepathic communication. But your information superhighway is a significant transition for that idea. Individuals have not placed their timing in this linear timing to admit that. To skip ahead to the telepathic. There is something quite liberating about the willingness to begin to engage through information as you say electronically. Or however you choose to express your network. It is very fascinating. Exciting to get more and more of a facility to do visual art and graphic. Not graphic. Generate from the computer. It is really very obvious perhaps to all that the state of your network, what you call your instrument, is quite rudimentary at this point. But it is growing exponential. And you will find abilities arriving very shortly that dwarf what you have so far expressed. It is in its baby steps as you say. So you think you could have 15,000 lives back or the age? Up to you. You are everything. You know where you need to know where you need to know. So to us memory is as you say, superfluous. Understand. I am going to do this thing. Do you have any new ideas about balancing and utilizing our energy motion in the S3's hours? Energy with projection and relaxation and the male female getting in. Light source enter into the Curis. All right. Did we get the question? Yes. I don't have a answer, proceed. No, the answer was what you would prefer to add the space in between, delivered directly to him. Oh, okay. All right. Oh, which might come from the question that we have the other night that I didn't write down, as in terms of how we guide the needs of the family information, you think something like those that you did proceed to add individuals to all of energy. Oh, my God. Before you proceed, we have discussed with him before the idea of being willing to take credit for his own inspirations. And he may understand that in general, perhaps 98% of the time, what he is exploring are his own inspirations. So, you do the math. I don't know what the question is. Oh, it's just a different question. But I got to say, if David moved now to the question, I said that when he actually pulled the paper to do his ink loss, he said that there is a similar to how in my handling and drawing, I would feel an energy flow. I don't know if that's exactly what he means, but is there another reason for creating a specific ink loss with him? From time to time, if the result would be so subtle that he would, in general, not notice the difference. So again, 98% of him... Correct. God. He can simply add, broadly as he wished, paint that 98% across his life, stand up a little straighter and trust what he can. So I have one more question for me. Oh, do you proceed? Why me? This is the matter. Why not? One other answer, because you would have it no other way. And simply, when you are willing to trust that, you will allow yourself to see why. When you do not allow yourself to trust that, you function as what you refer to in your society as victim. Very true. You would have it no other way with that basic assumption, reinterpret your reality. The results of all your realities are truly, truly a response to decisions that you make about who you are in each and every moment. It is up to you and only you to understand that when you can say it all, you always have the choice to choose any of. Anything that you are experiencing is automatically a result of the choices that you have made. Now, not necessarily do you make the conscious choice, I will be miserable. But you do make the choice, I am not succeeding. You do make the choice, I am not achieving. You do make the choice, I do not have the ability. Those are choices that interpretation of yourself is a choice. And we share this because understanding all this as a choice implies the ability to choose a new. If you understand why me because I would have it no other way, you begin to choose the interpretation that supports why you obviously would have it no other way. All your physical circumstances, all of you are a result of deciding in each and every moment who you are trusting in the decision in the interpretation of who you are and then acting as though you trust the decision. And as simple as this may seem as a way to sum up your methodology for creating your own reality, it is nevertheless still accurate. Nothing that is happening to you is not also happening from you, it is all happening from you. Your interpretation of the events, determine your experience of that totality, determine the filter through which you see your reality. Deciding who you are consciously, instead of seeming to allow a set of circumstances to dictate to you who you are, is an inherent ability that you have as a creator, all of you. It is always in every given moment and option to decide who you are, despite what you would say contrary to evidence of the opposite. Simply remind yourself that nothing ever happens to you, it happens from you. Simply remind yourself that your circumstances are a reflection of who you are, not the definition of who you are. Very often given we live in it for a density time, linear time. The big one given moment is you just need to see an extent of old things, actions, in place. And circumstances in down the line you are not that person. You may not want to bottle yourself into a time frame, but understand. But how it seems to have played out is, it's obviously a concept of what's in interest, and how it has been explored, and who has something else. A lot of our belief is that you choose who you are, what you do if you like, or you like, but that is independent of ideas. You can't have created a circuit to do something else, but that's why. Now from your awareness of your reality, from your awareness of what in life you have sampled, what you have enjoyed, what you have not enjoyed, your physical location, your timing, your relationships, in place, what excites you the most. No back, simply answer the question. So you are acting with people where the conversations tend to move forward, and that's been in place. Now now that you don't. But specifically... I'm not going to look at this. Nothing much has got my attention to it. No, no. When I say answer immediately, and I say do not ponder implications of your answer, I am asking you for what you generally refer to as a gut level response. So I will ask the question without judging it, without placing any parameters around it, what comes up, and then we can look, but what truly excites you the most. I am going to look at the channel and embarrass me. Oh, do you desire to continue to stop? Oh, that's a sign. That has to do with putting out the request for the opportunity. Now that request can now be more specific, that the opportunisms make themselves obvious by the fact that acting on them is energized by the fact that acting on them is effortless. Trusting the criteria that the process will reveal itself by also being as exciting as the so-called faith itself. Now that level of trust is available. It is available as a choice to you all. In general, not as a judgement for that of an observation, you do not allow yourself to go with actualness. So let us assume you have put the first step in place, and in simply being willing to define in the moment without parameters, that version of channeling information from yourself or from what you perceive to be other sources, which still reside within yourself. Is a valid idea to be exciting. And now beginning to say simply, I have played out the degree to where this type of the step and this type of the step and this type of the step are no longer exciting for me to engage in. All our labories are effort. So my request now, my revision of my request for opportunities to act on to begin to once again express the thing that excites is that the process itself is also exciting. And the specific request is easier to fit. When one is engaging in something that excites them, and an aspect of it, the process of it is the point of the phrase that you think is slept. And that doesn't excite one. I love the glorious and that diversity. Well, where what you call the process would become the board. Would you as an individual be willing to trust that that is your indication to yourself here is something else that you did not expect to do coming up in perfect timing? or is that where you then judge yourself to say, will everyone know at this point of this particular type of project one is supposed to and so on and so on. Right, rather than looking for another opportunity to produce the same result, it is not effortful and pain after it's full. When you begin to invite opportunity, exciting opportunity to act on it, the response time of the universe is generally in what you call free days. Within can be less, can be instantaneous. It is being willing to know you deserve that and being willing to clearly, clearly define your attention, to understand, yes, the process exciting as well. I deserve that, that is something that is completely valid and that is how I choose to express myself so that the word work no longer carries the connotation of laborious effortfulness, but carries the connotation of the stuff that I wish to express and do upon this time. And when you get to that point, we will call it home work once again. All right. I think that's, did something have anything else to say now? Well, a simple suggestion, as everything that we share is, only a suggestion, light not. Only be willing to lighten up. Express yourself with the willingness to love yourself. And when you love yourself, you are light. When you love yourself, you express things joyously. If you stumble and fall, so what? If something happens that you did, not intend, how exciting? If something seems to change direction or momentum, what a surprise. All these ideas, when judged, can yield what you call negative seeming results in your reality. All of these ideas, when accepted, as the process, as part of the process, and not a restriction or an interruption in it, will immediately change the results you are getting. You mean simultaneously to your redefining of who you are, does your reality, completely 100% change? If you are willing to maintain that resolve, you will continue to experience the change. If you are truly only willing to see yourself through older, less than power terms, you will express that as well. But it is your desire, individual, society, to see yourself in empowered terms, and you have that going forward. That desire is not lost in the whole totality of your consciousness. It is part of your expression in the age of transformation. Your willingness to interpret your reality as neutral and assign a useful meaning, as you may say, basic stuff here, folks, can come in very handy in this type. You have all the information you need, and it is merely a matter of being willing to pull out whichever tool, to pull out whichever perspective will assist you to realign, consistently enough that you are being that preferred person and no longer, after constantly, realign. A tool may seem that, well, I already know that. Well, that's fine and good. You already know it, but that's the tool that comes up as being full now. So do not allow your tool, because you've heard them before, to seem stale, used. They are shy. They are ready to come out of the bag whenever you require them. And the toolkit is very, very complete. This is one of the reasons that we have not communicated on a regular basis lately. The tools are there, and they do not become rusty. They are immediately always there, clear and shiny. Is that all? Oh, why did you have a good time? I did, good time. Oh, why? Imagine that. No. That person was used to it. Ah, is that your interpretation of who you are? That was the moment. No. Was that your interpretation of who you were? Let's assume you asked. They are simply perceived with this line of question. How did that you feel? What was the emotion generated by that choice? Absolutely. Sadness. Oh, I wouldn't have thought you that way. Oh, I'm in a proper way. Spirelling judgments, I assume. Making the new decision is as valid as maintaining the old decision. And your willingness to trust in this is all it takes. Turn the key once and for all. There is a point at which when you are willing to express your expanded consciousness. And I mean this figure to you because literally it's not for you. There are loopholes in which you can, shall I say, walk. But there in again the figure of sense is no turning fact. And that is the threshold that many of you perceive. Once you are willing to resolve who you are, decide who you are, emanate who you are rather than interpret who you are from your surrounding circumstance. When you do that consistently for but a short time as you create time, there is no turning back. Everything remains too obvious and evident. All paths are clearly enough seeable in front of you to the point where if it switches direction, that is as clear as well. Believe it or not, ultimately you will embrace and part of the joy of the road will be the change in direction. Because once you create the point at which you trust everything, that change in direction is the delightful surprise. So even just being able to say yes and get into alignment with what I am saying allows you to feel that sense of it. Now that you have felt it, you can express it anytime you wish by sin. And again it is your language, very apoffo, re-minding yourself according to preference. I have done that. I thank you for your willingness to shine the mirror, appear and see yourself. Rebel in what you like and rise to the occasion of transforming the things that you know you can be, that you would prefer to express. Not running from any idea of who you are but simply being, embracing, expressing and walking toward more of yourself. You need not look at any moment that you are creating as something to escape from when you always have the choice in that same moment to see what you can walk to or what you can more accurately be right now. Once you remove the notion that you have the ability to make the decision, you remove effectively speaking. Third dimensionally speaking, your ability to express your power, but you do not ever truly completely remove it. All it takes to express it again is a simple and slight shift in your approach to remind, re-mind, re-align to who you are. On that note I will thank you and simply say your willingness to trust the timing of everything in your life, including interacting with us, will allow you to see the sense in things more clear. Anything that we share with you we perceive as a gift and unconditional gift. But part of that gift right now is what you may interpret as periods of silence. It is simply what makes what you call a song or a melody so beautiful and distinct, not only the notes, but the space and the timing between them. On that note I will bid you a most fond and loving good day and will assure you in some way, in some form, we will speak again. All right.
