 In the dream that someone else is chasing her, she was then instructed in that sense to look at what she is running away from within herself. Do proceed. And this was termed facing the bear, turning around and facing what she has been running away from. For again, there is nothing that you can create, nothing that you cannot use in a positive way. And what reconciles is the mere willingness to look at the symbol. Then you will not need the protection from it. You can simply integrate it, acknowledge it, keep it if you like it, choose anew if you do not. Do proceed. Okay, so, right, here is what an incident of a sexual madness might work. I think it's fighting symbol and an opportunity to assert who you are. Well, we think someone else. No. Do you understand what we need? Yes. We are not belittling from your end what occurred. No, I understand everything. We're saying that that is a creation, perhaps because it involves someone else. There would be the initial tendency to say it is happening to you, but that is not acting like an owner. Therefore, the effect you will get is that it is happening to you. But by simply assuming all right, I have chosen to co-create this. How does it serve me and how can I express and allow myself the opportunity to not squelch what I feel, then everybody learns. What did you do? Number one, I did not look at myself as a victim. I looked at it as though, yes, I had a hand in creating this. Now, we are not saying that you deserve it in that sense, but do proceed. Right. So, instead of looking at it and being a victim, I looked at it as saying, well, what am I trying to show myself here? What can I get from this? And basically, there were two things. One is that I am a person and I deserve much respect and give me and anybody else in that environment. All right. Self-wob, self-respect. Very good. And the other thing is that I now experience a lot of difficulty because within this work environment, it's mostly male and people think that, you know, women in this environment, that you just have to expect it to treat it this way. All right. Now, people think this, yes. But it does not have that effect on you till on some level, you match it and buy into it. So, your simple willingness to only be representative of your viewpoint shows them other options. That also gives you a particularly conducive opportunity. And we mean this in the following way. There have been incidences. Specifics are not important. You will understand what we mean. In your past, whereby perhaps you have more willingly played victim and not allowed yourself to express in the situation who you are. You are now in a sense recreating a similar scenario but can treat it as if anew by refusing to not express who you are and trusting that that expression with integrity, with perhaps you can say unconditional self-love and love of others, but that that reflection will not only assist you but them as well, no matter how they choose to take it, by being willing to express who you are in a loving way, you are of service to them. Whether or not they agree with you. Okay. I just want to react to- Do you understand the references we have made? Yes. Yes. Thank you very much. And I guess that from your outward appearance of behavior, it's hard to see that I'm having any kind of respect. Do you understand? It is an elaborate game of, perhaps you can say, ping pong. And they can only hit the ball if you return it. You're unwillingness to return it and maintain who you are. Simply, shall we say, calls the game on account of rain. They no longer have the material to reflect back to you. They can only keep getting a similar result are you to dance in that step with him. I understand. And I just want to let you know that I really appreciate having interacted with you and your assistance in allowing me to act with integrity. Oh, and we thank you for your willingness to do just that. Act in that way and again remind you. Any communication that you have to make can be made in a loving way without invalidating the other individual's point of view. When you are willing to be a living example of this, which you are, then you will see an effect. And you will not get the quote unquote response that you have come to expect. For if you enter a situation doing the same thing and expecting a different result, what do you get? But if you change but one aspect of your involvement in the interaction, you cannot help to get a reflection of that change. Simply allow your eyes to look for the reflection of the change rather than what is still the same. Then you will be validating according to the new preferred belief rather than re anchoring yourself to the old preferred belief by using its results as validation. Do you understand? In a loving way. Always. And if you are not feeling that you are able in a moment to make a communication in a loving way, then the issues are internal issues. For it is not that they are being obnoxious by pushing your button that it will behoove you to look at. What it will behoove you to look at is why you have such a button. That is the only thing you can affect. Therefore, it is no longer harassment. You refuse to be moved from your center. And you can communicate this in a loving way the way you would prefer they interacted with you. So somebody is providing some example of that for them to blatantly see. Thank you. Shutting. All of the time. This week I have created, or in the past few months I have created, the situation in my job. And it is progressed where it is negative. And I have been switched from my president's position to something else. And I need to make a choice this weekend whether I would like to continue or make a separation. May I ask you a question? Yes. What excites you the most? I am thinking that this is even though it seems unanticipated for too soon. It seems like an opportunity for me to make a change that I need to make a change. But what excites you the most? In making a choice with what I'm supposed to do. Oh. I'm still working on that. Are you through? No. Alright. I'll give you another moment. Oh. No. I am still searching. There is no need to search for what is right in front of your face. What excites you? Do not hear the voices talking you out of it. Do not hesitate. When I ask you what excites you what comes to mind? Not being constrained by this place because I feel it's a place where there's a lot of fear. Oh. Now there is some information in that answer but I did not ask you what does not excite you. Well done. With Kenny we did the program and I liked that very much. Oh. One example in that sense would be to involve yourself in programs of that sort. What else? Communication. It's nice to me very much. What is the nature of the job you now have? It's a secretarial and it was covering partly in communication. And now that you are transforming it, it is changing face. Does the new presentation have the parameter of the ability to communicate in it or not? Does the new job still have communications within it? I could keep up that part of it. Yes. That's part of it. But it is not built into the definition? No because it's working for a whole department and that's it just seems like a step down rather than a step up. Do you feel you deserve a step down? No. Oh, you have your answer. It will always be an option to settle for mine. And you can if you wish do so. But you may wish to consider that you do deserve anything that with integrity you desire. You do not have a desire to dangle a carrot out in front of you that you can never get. Your desire, your excitement is an indication of what not only is available to you but what you have the capability to act upon. You are in that sense, as many individuals are perhaps you can say utilizing an earlier analogy at a crossroads. But this crossroads in that sense opens you to infinite possibilities. You can simply choose according to in that sense your obligation your sense of what everyone knows you should do. Or you can begin to cue in to what moves you, what excites you and to whatever degree you are able to act and move in that direction. When you get to moments where you are not able to act upon it again from what is available act using your excitement to choose. And that is the simplest in that sense perhaps you can say advice that we can render. If I do choose to move away, is the... Then the trust that you now perhaps have that things won't work out or you'll lose your security. You can move over a little bit to the right and trust in the new preferred use. For in a sense when you speak of the old job that perhaps is not representative of who you are as providing security what truly is the definition of that security. The ability to continue to do the things that are not reflective of who you are. And from our perspective that is not truly secure. So you feel that a change will also provide me with the financial needs that I require? Well by definition if you follow an act upon your excitement the universe provides whatever abundance is necessary in that sense to continue to be that you just as it has provided the abundance to be perhaps you can say not you. So therefore yes you can assume that but again we remind you that abundance is an ability and not one particular symbol of money. How can I develop more the ability to predict my future or rather than creating a negative event to make a positive change create a positive change? In the moment that you feel something is occurring that you consider negative. Again allow that interpretation of the negativity to come through remind yourself and thank the old you for providing it and give yourself a new alternative. With your imagination the tool of your imagination conjure up the preferred you state the belief the preferred belief of the preferred you. Allow yourself to feel what it feels like to believe that. Allow yourself to think the thoughts that one would think if they believe that and felt it. Then allow your imagination in that given situation to provide what the new preferred you would do in that situation. Look at what the new preferred you would do. Look at what the perhaps quote unquote old you would have done. Then it will be simple to choose. Then you will be acting according to your preference and can only then get back a reality reflective of your preference. Does that make sense? Yeah. Use your imagination in a positive way not to project what is futures but to lay down a model or a template for how to be right now in the present. Then before you act always give yourself at least one other option. When you have a negative interpretation you always have the opportunity to immediately act or take a step back. And upon taking that step back you can then provide other options which will most often because they are representative of who you are be far more attractive and far more effortless to do if only you allow yourself to think of it. Can you use that? Yes, thank you. One other thing. This weekend I was told that people have different lights or light and mine was told to be yellow. Now this fluctuates. Meaning money. I didn't go further into it but could you say anything further than that? At this time we are not fully comprehending the reference. Can you be more specific? Well I think the colors were white, black, yellow and blue. Well again what was shared with you is arbitrary. If you adopt it, if you buy into it it can be your reality. But you can simply also use it as an example of something you do not prefer if indeed the effect is something that would hold you back to up to you. It is not etched in stone in that way, no. But that is one way to look at it. It is not the only way. Does that mean that you? Perhaps you can say you have a yellow light at this moment, for you are hesitating. You are perhaps proceeding with caution. You can simply turn it to a green light. Okay. I also wanted to say that the letting goes working well. Oh thank you very much. Letting go is the exercising of your control. Not forcing and making something do happen. For as we have said change is one of the only constants. And change only occurs not by forcing but by the allowance. Which is not by definition a gripping posture but a releasing one. We thank you. There will be time for but a few more. I'm having some. Let me just say hello. I spoke with you before about my son and his illness. And I used some of the things that you told me in Tim and gave him. One moment can you speak up and begin again. Okay. I spoke with you before about my son who is ill. And we were having some difficulty with him dealing with his illness. And the information that you gave me last time about helping him look at that has been successful. Oh my. And for those present please share the nature of the illness. My son is a cancer, he has a cancer phone tumor which has only diagnosed at 10. And he's now come to the end of chemotherapy but what has been happening is his inability to deal with that. He's only negative things about that and what we're trying to do is to get him to look at things in a more positive life so that he could move on. Now may I ask you a question. Understand that when an individual creates a symbol such as this that also by definition involves other individuals including yourself. Understand that the lessons in that sense that have been chosen have been chosen by all. Including yourself. So your willingness to glean at how that symbol not only is within your life but serves you. Provides a living reflective example that can as you say take the edge off the atmosphere and allow him to see that you are greening it. You in that sense are using this creation he can do without insisting that he does. They are going better but my question about him tonight really does deal with that but given his relationship with his father. You're having a great deal of trouble. And I was wondering if you could see anything that would help me to help the two of them. Well first of all what is your perception of the nature of what you are calling the trouble. I think my son is very angry about a number of things and this anger is coming out and it's being directed right now. And his father. Now what is the reaction of the father. Understand that this is in a sense a co-creation. A great deal of concern. Guilt. Guilt and I think putting some guilt back on to the child. Now do you know what guilt is. Guilt not hate is the true opposite of love. Hate is a polarized expression of love but still contained by definition some visibility in there. Guilt is in the moment you are experiencing it a total lack of sense of self-deservability. So this simple elucidation of that definition can allow if he prefers for it as always up to them. The husband to look at that guilt when it comes up perhaps replacing that guilt with unconditional self-love and then when he does. When he feels that unconditional self-love that will reflect back to the child. For the issuance of the guilt quote unquote to the child is only possible if he first experiences it himself as well as the love. Or you can only love another per se as your Bible says as you love yourself which presumes that you do. So the father's willingness being that he has perhaps you can say at least in this life more experience. To begin to look at instances in which he feels complete lack of self-worthiness and deservability reassigned the unconditional self-love will then automatically have his actions subtly affected toward the child in that way. And will allow the child to match the unconditional love just as the child now matches the guilt. And the guilt by definition shall we say slows down the healing. For healing the allowance of wellness occurs within an aligned being. And unconditionally self-loving being automatically aligned. One who feels unworthy and undeserving in that sense is misaligned so to speak with their higher purpose. Now this can relate to you in your relationship to this situation as well. I've never thought about looking at it that way in that. Well thank you for using us as a meal. That does make sense but what do you think my role would be in trying to help them? Speaking about some of the things we are sharing to the degree that you feel excited about sharing it and being your version of what we are speaking about which is all that you can ever do for another person anyway. By being responsible for yourself and being willing to express who you are you are automatically responsible to other beings. You cannot be responsible for anyone else but you can be responsible to them. So therefore where the issues affect you and you find yourself reacting rather than acting from your centered preferred self. You can now begin to call up that centered preferred self. Begin to use your imagination to provide a mold much in the way that we have just discussed. And begin to perform the actions that are consistent with your own version of self unconditional love and service and unconditional love and service to others as well. The removal of those conditions will take off what you perhaps are labeling to be much of the pressure of the situation. So be a clear reflection of who you are in love in light and should you find yourself experiencing the degrees of lack of self love use that reflection interact with it. Okay. Is that practical enough? Yes, actually that would give me some good ideas about what to do and what maybe my role has been in the posting as well. And there is a high degree of likelihood that should you in that sense as you say in your slang, nip this in the bud right now that there can be an accelerated period of what you call healing within the next three of your month. Depending upon your ability and willingness to express your ability to unconditionally love in this way. For your willingness to open up to the portions of yourself that you have previously labeled alien for in that sense. We are reflections for each other in that sense mirrors of mirrors which if you even in your own particular societal understanding place many mirrors together you can see into infinity. It is all there all reflected always reflecting back to you what will serve you in that moment the most but only if when you in that sense create this you use it in that way. That is living your life creating your reality from you through you not to you. We thank you. We bid you a most fond and loving pleasant dreams and good night. Thanks for coming.
