 All right, I'll say, greetings this evening of your time as you create time to exist. How are you all? Oh, thank you very much. Allow me to begin this interaction with the following title. Point of power. Your particular society, as do, shall we say several other physical societies, tend to, shall we say, create time in a particularly fascinating way whereby you have what you call before, during, and after. Now interestingly enough, though you have a sense of what has come before and what it is that shall we say as you say, is to come, you always only ever actually exist or experience the moment you call right now. So what this means is that in a now moment, you recreate a past. You project a future and in that sense, then maintain a relationship and a vested interest in that sense to your relationship to the past in and the future in such a way where many times you neglect what is happening right now. Understand that although things or events sequentially from a set of steps from a path may lead to a present or now moment, that is where the relationship ends. There is no causal in that sense relationship in the present from the past. There is no effect that the past can have on the present until you say or you determine that it done. Or in that now moment, you then create the effect from a quote unquote seeming past, but you create it right here, right now. So therefore, yes, you feel the effects seemingly of a past, but it is not from the past itself having a hold on you. It is from your interpretation in the moment, your attitude in the moment, and ultimately your actions in the moment for if those actions reflect a high degree of belief that the past does in that sense affect the present, then you create an effect that seems to provide the evidence that it does, that seems to continuously provide a rationale that the past does affect the present. But that is merely something that you do in the now moment. Therefore the now moment is always your point of power. For since you always ever exist in the now, it is always eternally right now. You can always change your reality right now for there is no other time. When you are willing to begin to look at that, you are not remembering a past that is quote unquote still there, but recreating the past from the present right now. You will understand that right now is all that matters. Right now is the point at which you make any determination or relationship to a past or a future. So right now is the time that you can change that idea. Your particular manifestation physically speaking of your reality results generally from three steps. Number one in a given now moment from a given set of circumstances, you have an interpretation. In general, you will ascribe a positive or negative interpretation to a particular given situation. Now understand the situation in and of itself is a blank set of props with no built in meaning. You assign the meaning and if it is something that is generally societally labeled bad and you then buy into that and automatically label it negative, then you cannot help in that sense but get a negative effect from that neutral symbol. But the opposite is also true. It is always your choice in any given now moment to remember that the symbol that the event has really no built in meaning until you assign it. And that perhaps yes, there are certain aspects of a given situation which may on the surface seem negative. That is not the only thing or the only message that the circumstance has built into it. For when we say all situations are neutral, that neutrality is expressed as a hundred percent potentiality for a negative manifestation but also one hundred percent potentiality for a positive. And this means that are you to ascribe a positive meaning to something which you hear to for have ascribed a negative meaning to. You cannot help but get a different effect out of it. For in again each now moment what you do is interpret from that blank set of props whether you in that sense will choose, perhaps sometimes not consciously but now we are seeking of doing it consciously to label it negative or positive. Now we had said that in that sense is in three steps. Step one in each now moment is your interpretation. Once you interpret something as either perhaps negative or positive, you then assume an attitude with that particular interpretation as a foundation. So therefore again to extrapolate if you give a negative interpretation you in general will assume a negative attitude or posture. If you give a positive interpretation then in that sense you are more likely to assume a positive attitude. And lastly you then act, you then do in the moment right now something with that interpretation and that attitude as a foundation. And it is ultimately the doing of that thing right now that creates your reality, that manifests your reality physically because it is the actions that are the movers in that sense in your physical world right now. Therefore you always in any given now moment have the opportunity, have the advantage to understand that you get to and choose the interpretation. You get to choose for regardless of whether or not in that sense you do consciously decide to choose or not. Choose you will though perhaps if it is from a negative perspective the choice will be somewhat automatic and unconscious. What we are discussing is the waking up in the now moment, the only time you ever exist in any given situation when you find yourself with shall we say an outdated interpretation. And interpretation that oh no here it comes again for example is a negative interpretation presupposing that that is in a sense happening to you rather than from you. And when in that sense you say oh no here it comes that is an interpretation with a negative shall we say back end and therefore can only result in a negative attitude and then your actions will subtly or perhaps blatantly then manifest or represent that negative attitude. You can always in that sense take back your point of power. You can always in that sense create a shall we say gap or a lag or a pause between the interpretation and the action for again if your interpretation is shall we say negative and in that sense you assume a negative attitude but you then do nothing you cannot then get the negative manifestation. It is the doing stage in that sense that creates the reality. So therefore this gives you the liberty the license to think whatever you wish as long as you do not automatically then act with those thoughts as a foundation. Therefore you can now begin to reinterpret according to preference. You can now understand all right something perhaps which in the past I have labeled negative is occurring. Obviously I can see what is negative about it in the past when I have interpreted this way had my attitude before my actions I have only gotten a negative result out of it therefore I have absolutely nothing to lose by at least placing a pause before I do anything and giving myself the opportunity in that sense to reinterpret from the perspective of a creator of a conscious manifest or and you can always reinterpret something which you had initially assigned a negative meaning or label to by asking yourself the simple wild card question wild card meaning you can pull it out of your deck anytime. How does this serve me exactly the way it is in what way is this symbol that I have created of assistance to me what is it for instance forcing me to look at what is it for instance indicating about what I still may believe in a limiting sense you can always by simply asking how is this of service to me exactly the way it is get at least some negative shall we say alternative option in other words the positive some positive interpretation for if you look at how it serves you or what it shall we say again forces you in that sense to look at you can then simply consciously derive that service or consciously choose to look at what you have created a symbol to force you to look at because you wish to look at it and then no longer need the symbol to prod you from behind. The now moment is truly your point of power for it is eternal it always was right now never was there a time where you could say it is not right now and in that sense so that shall by extension continue it will always eternally be now. So therefore there is no path that you need dig up and in that sense be responsible for integrating every aspect of it in a tenuous and tortuous manner for when in that sense you simply begin to derive your actions and your creatorhood from the now moment you automatically will create any opportunity to bring up any limiting belief which yes you may have bought into in your path but it is not inherently the path itself that is important it is the fact that you give yourself the opportunity to look at the least which no longer serve you and you always will give yourself that opportunity. One of the greatest signs or signals that you are creating in a given now moment in particular belief which no longer serves you is what you call negative emotion emotion itself is always a direct result of a belief system with no exception no exception. For whatever you feel you always feel because you believe something. Therefore any time you have a negative emotion in the now moment right now you can always ask yourself if you do not choose to just automatically from that negative interpretation assume a negative attitude perform negative actions and simply get the negative reality if you place a pause in there you can always interpret what must I believe right now right now from what is happening right now not yesterday not last year not when I was a child right now what must I believe to be feeling this and if you are honest you will always come up with a limiting belief a belief which perhaps you will say well yes I do believe that and boy is that dated that no longer apply to who I choose to be but now that I have found the belief now that I have drummed it up it is no longer even important how or when I created it what is important is now I know I have this belief and when you own the belief you can change it and that is the only way you can change a belief you cannot change a belief by assuming the new belief in denial of the old belief the old belief will always in that sense subtly affect your actions and through the filtration of those actions bring itself back to the quote unquote surface you cannot escape your true beliefs but the good news is that once you do accept them acknowledge them own them you can change them when in that sense you believe something that shall we say lays down the blueprint for how you will interpret it and for the attitude that you will then assume and the actions that you will then take therefore you always act as though you believe something so once you acknowledge the belief that you no longer prefer you can then extrapolate how you have been acting because you have that belief and you can see that it was those actions that gave the effect of the limiting belief in your life this is half the key to changing to the preferred belief for this in that sense lays down for you how you create with that old limiting belief you act as though you believe it and those actions put into place physically the reality therefore once you acknowledge a belief in the now moment that you no longer prefer you may use the tool of your imagination rather than as an escape rather than as a fantasy the tool of your imagination to create a new blueprint a new template a new model and briefly simply as follows close your eyes picture the new preferred you picture in that sense the you you in that sense prefer to be with the new belief you already have and picture it until you can feel what that new belief feels like for anything you believe will always again result in an emotion and when you consciously choose to believe something and invoke it speak it say it if you do it with conviction in that moment in isolation you will create the feeling of the new belief and when you feel that you will then be able to picture if you will how you would act if you truly believe the new belief you will see that those actions will always differ from the actions you have generally been doing to get the negative result and you will see in that sense right in front of you in the now moment options rather than automatic tendency to shall we say commit and act with a negative foundation you now have options here is how the old negative me would act here is how the new preferred me would act and I will venture to guess that side by side the preferred you the new blueprint you in your imagination the actions that that you performs will simply be far easier to choose for now that you have given yourself the option it is far more representative of who you wish to be and therefore by simply acting as the new you that your imagination has laid down as a blueprint in acknowledgement of the old belief you now create the reality the effect right now of the new belief in the same way that you already created the old so there is nothing in that sense new to learn here simply it's like shift in perspective of how to apply what you already flawlessly apply in your creations and the fact that again you always exist right now means that any now moment you can take back your power you can have that moment be the fulcrum for your point of expressing your power according to preference perhaps we can in that sense summarize and simplify what we have said before you act before you do anything particularly when what you are about to do comes from a negative foundation if you will always at least provide yourself with one positive alternative from your imagination from the referential preferential you that you create within your imagination I again will venture to guess that you will always find it far simpler to do the thing that is again representative of who you wish to be and merely the providing of the option your willingness to take the action step of providing that option will have that new positive perspective that new positive approach and action be far more attractive and make it that much simpler to choose and implement than the old and one by one as your actions now reflect the new preferred you again in acknowledgement of the old beliefs not denial one by one the results of your life the results of your actions begin to transform your life right now immediately across the board when you decide to change in that way and that is simply all there is to it the simple decision I wish to change from this to this you may understand that in making the decision that you wish to change because now is the only time that ever exists in that now moment you have changed already the mere conception of the idea of the change is the same as being the change now you can continue then to create a continuity with the old you and make it seem like a passing thing or in that sense you can just decide I have changed because I say so because I desire to because I know I create right now and right now I decide to change then secondly trust in that change see where in that sense you are not trusting in it and provide the alternative of trusting in it and lastly act as though you trust you have changed and any given now moment that you are willing to do this in this way you then transform completely immediately and holding to the degree that you are willing to accept that you can and since you make all the rules it's up to you therefore change in a sense can be something which is a lazy process can be in that sense something whereby you analyze every aspect of your past obviously that also works and we are not saying that what we are saying is any better however it is another way and perhaps works faster if indeed we are understanding correctly that it is the desire of you both individually and collectively as a society do desire to change immediately and that immediate change can be expressed from the simple decision to change again the trust that I have changed in that allowing anything to provide contrary evidence reinterpreting it and then acting as though you trust you have changed that is all there is to it all the stuff that you have analyzed from your past again if it is significant if in that sense it truly does limit you it will come up but you will not have to find it it will find you and generally once again in the form of a negative emotion or a negative interpretation your point of power is eternal you are multidimensional and eternal beings you are expressing yourself finitely as physical beings right now for particular reasons but your sense of your eternal mess can be shall we say at least approached from the perspective that it is always forever right now that no matter when it is now never was there a moment that you existed in your life when it was not right now therefore this is your consistent access to your creator hood your direct access to your creator hood when you spend your now moments recreating a non preferred path projecting a non preferred future you in general do so at the cost of what is right in front of your face right now in front of your face and if you are willing to ground yourself back into the now moment the form that that takes is when something comes up acting yourself well right now is the only time I ever exist right now is the only time I can ever act from the thing that I am looking at right now is it something I can do something about right now if the answers yes go right ahead if the answer is no then it is a distraction then because you cannot act upon it and are placing attention upon it you are looking at it at the cost of what is right there so if you ask yourself this question and the answer is no I cannot do anything about it push that aside then look at what is right here right now that is how you reground yourself into the moment in any given moment with that simple question for you can only act on certain options in a given moment in the way that you lay down the succession in that sense so to speak of now moments and therefore should you place your attention and concentrate on what you can act upon there will always be a relevant set of choices and from those choices there will always be something which excites you which gives you more passion more desire than the others and if you are willing from what is available not from what is not from what is available in any given moment to use that barometer within you of your excitement of your gravitation toward of your passion for as a criteria to choose from what is available you will then always express the choice that is directly indicative of the choice of perhaps you can say your higher self or the choice that is representative of what is most you in this life for excitement itself is the vibratory energy that tells you what is most you that is why it excites you and nobody else it is the sign that many of you have been asking for oh I need a sign the sign is your excitement many times something very exciting comes along and you say not right now I'm looking for my time but that is your sign that is why you feel that way uniquely you feel that way therefore your point of power can always be acted upon in a positive way by providing at least one positive alternative by recreating the referential preferential you to do so this is always immediately available and though at first it may seem as a series of steps your willingness to even approach it in this way in and of itself as an action and a statement to the universe and will then reorient your entire reality toward that preference and the process so to speak will become simply automatic whereby you automatically and effortlessly will provide to yourself the positive alternatives representative of who you now choose to be rather than perhaps somebody that everyone said you should be you get to decide who you wish to be even if you decide that you wish to be what everyone else says you should be that is still your choice but only you can know only you can know if it excites you and only you if you are willing to act from what is available on the thing that excites you with integrity only you can create your life in a positive way it is very simple it is that simple now it will be up to you to allow it to be that simple or to add as many intervening steps as you feel you need in order to validate the change but ultimately that is all changes anyway a decision on your part to change and then either trusting in that change and getting the results of it or trusting in what you perceive to be a process that then results in your validating the change so it's the same result you still finally validate the change and it is the validation of the change that makes the change not the process so we are not denigrating processes and we understand in that sense that they can be valuable but are simply suggesting that it is in a sense an elaborate game that you play to give yourself permission to say alright I've done enough work I can now give myself permission to change here is the homework to prove it and that is one way to go about it but it takes more time and if you wish for your reality to be transformed right now right here go right ahead it is up to you it is your point of power in exchange for your willingness to open up within you the many doors to break down the walls separating yourselves into many parts and begin now to unfold into your wholeness into your totality we thank you and express our unconditional love to you for your willingness to share this with us it brings us great joy in that sense to share with your experience to relish your particular perspectives for every creation every aspect of creation itself is unique and has something unique to offer we understand this and in that sense see everyone that we interact with for the societies that have everyone's a gift of creation itself and it is our extreme pleasure to unwrap you and in that sense relish the contents that you choose to share with us therefore in exchange for your willingness to do so I asked you now how may I be of service to you shut it. The current year introduction this is an exploration that we've been going through what I've been seeing is that in action in relationships with other people that you like pull back and look at the present. Now I assume you do not mean me when you say you pull back. No no one steps back and says you know what is the preferred way but you know how to observe me and how would I like to interact as you're interacting with people in work day to day being in relationship that we have that beliefs about how other people are interacting with us. Oh dear that comes again you know they're validating me you know where to believe well that will occur whether or not they are invalidating me so that is why your only shall we say the option is to exercise your point of power and perhaps at why would I believe or what much I believe to think that one in that sense would invalidate me and also that I could then buy into it and produce the effect of feeling invalidating for no one can truly invalidate anyone else without their participation. Right that's what I've been saying is that it only takes one person in relationship to break that cycle which makes things quite a bit more simple with the complexities of the relationships upon your plan. It only takes one aim in that sense you can say it is perhaps a game of ping pong and if you do not return the ball there is simply no balls to play with therefore it is always shall we say from your side of the table your options to simply catch the ball and decide not to play quite in that way. Right in providing them with another option for themselves and in that sense if there is in that way a particular interpretation from your end that they meaning the other individuals may have a specific intention it is only to your benefit and the benefit of that individual to ask them for then you can in that sense get their particular perspective and then decide at least having their accurate perspective how you wish to act or react. But the difficulty in many of these cases is not necessarily from what is said between individuals but what is not said. Therefore your willingness to open up your willingness to say I have felt this therefore it deserves in that sense to be brought up I deserve in that sense to honor that if I feel this it is something that is relevant to me I shall discuss it I shall find out I shall get the feedback from the individual rather than the hesitation that you will be viewed in a negative way for exploring and being open. Yes very often it is an opportunity to do the damn near beliefs about what other people might think of you and speaking about it. Now again if they think that if they do not think that of you then all well and good you have settled that but if they actually do think that that then gives you the new opportunity to decide will I buy into it that is simply their opinion do I believe what they are saying if you believe what they are saying you may feel bad but if you in that sense decide that is not relevant to who you are you will not feel in that sense a negative emotion. So the negative emotion from your end is your indication that on some level you are buying into that belief. Does that exist? Certainly that. Thank you very much. Is that all? That's it. What are you thinking? Yes. Do you want? I have two areas of questions tonight and each one may challenge some challenge somewhat your computer database. How exciting, never watch it. Several months ago I was watching a morning talk show on TV hosted by Joan Rivers. She had five or six young people there maybe fourteen to sixteen years old and each one was outstanding in some particular career skill whether it was music or science or something but one particular young man from England just caught me so strong in that he seemed to have extreme wisdom and intelligence and he had taken over his father's business which was failing and was turning it into a very successful operation. Oh what? But the point- You will find the juxtaposition between what you call the teacher and the learner quite often these days if in that sense you are willing to see that those roles are quite arbitrary and everyone is actually both. You may find many individuals you hear to four-pound could only benefit from your own knowledge had actually had quite a busy teaching you. Do you person? Okay. This young man said many amazing things to me at least and they asked him what he saw as his career and he said my mission on this planet is to help straighten out the major issues that faced this earth and he was very serious and struck me as extremely competent to go about doing this and so forth. So I guess my first question is can you yet identify this person in your database? Joan, what can I identify with this? The energy. Enough to perhaps answer a few questions. Do proceed. Okay. Well my first question was can you identify whether his energy is really going to play a major part in leading this planet to do good? It is our meaning of perception that yes it is. Okay. So typically the determination and the conviction and the lack of hesitation in and of itself tells you that. All right. Now I want to switch over to the other area of question. Oh number two? Okay. About a year ago or so in answer to my request about the status of my parents who had both died in a traffic accident in January 64 I was told that my father had reincarnated as male roughly 14 years ago. Now that was about a year ago. Okay. And of course that was all that was given to me at that time. Can you tell me is he living in England at this point? Now before in that sense I replied may I ask you why you are asking? Very interesting. Okay. This morning early on the phone one of my long frequent phone call with my brother the subject ended up that I had this idea and the idea when it came to me and when I verbalized it to my brother he said he said one moment ago I knew you were going to say exactly that and that idea was that this young fellow that I saw on Joan Rivers TV show was in his previous life our father. Ah. Very interesting. Yes. I thought you knew you think. Well it fit very much my feeling and my experience with my father and his interests when he was alive and very much that his dissatisfaction with politics with life on this earth is not being fair and equal to all and on and on. And so all of this fit very well when I saw this young man on TV. Then we thank you in that sense for creating and in that sense maintaining and establishing that connection. Well I understand all things are connected and I knew this would be connected but of course I knew you probably wouldn't choose to really give me a specific answer as to whether my feeling was indeed was accurate. Well in that sense I just have and in that sense will now allow you to continue to validate or invalidate to your choice whether you in that sense feel this to be true but we will simply suggest that now is the time of the taking back of your power as the way to express that power is your willingness to trust what you know to be true for you. Your willingness to take the step of simply validating something because you feel it because it rings true with you will be a far more assistance to you right now and will in that sense allow you to unfold that much further into your conscious creative. We thank you. When you sense any of our vibrations are you able to sense whether one of us or all of us but one of us is destined for greatness. Well in that sense we understand that you all are. Perhaps you can say we have access to certain probable tendencies but because you have free will and the mere rendering of a prediction again a probable tendency can be enough the information of it to change the actual prediction. This is why again from our perspective there is no such thing as a prediction of the future but sensing of the energies available right now for all various shall we say parallel and alternate reality intersect in many of your now moments. So therefore there are literally an infinite number of probable futures. You have in that sense the particular tendency given your course of actions right here right now the only time there is a tendency toward shall we say some of them versus others of them but again this is ever changing and your knowledge of it can be enough in that sense to have you change your actions sufficiently to change the outcome. So it is still in your court but ultimately since we understand that all life is an expression that expands that evolves that incorporates and integrates things you formerly in that sense shows to see as external to yourself as internal you are all in that sense ultimately destined for grace and cannot in that sense manifest anything else. Wonderful thank you very much. Always thank you Esme. Shut it. I'm interested in your point of view on the following. When I visualize shock grows a certain way or I visualize energy fields or I create a white light around me or around something or I pull down a certain color light in and through my body does that in fact objectively exist or is that in way of visualizing simply to help me focus my thinking. Well again perhaps on some level it would appear to objectively exist in the way that you are meaning the question but not to make it too confusing understand from our perspective there is no truly such thing as an objective we are. For the moment you perceive it it is subjective and you in that sense generally draw a separation between the perceived and the perception but our understanding is that it is all one interrelated interconnected event that cannot be fitted or separated out to parts. Taking this a bit further if I perceive a non-physical being as a like a white tornado let's say with sparkles is that a image that just allows me to identify that energy or does that energy bias or does that being bias nature present that way to my senses. Now it can be both but understand there are certain manifestations of energy that you would call perhaps more textual in nature that would in that sense assume the pattern that you sometimes call spiral so in that particular instance it can be more shall we say liberal. Okay and taking it just a little bit further if I visualize a green light around my body let's say am I in fact creating a light that emits the wavelength of green. Well in that sense you are expressing from the white light which contains all colors that particular aspect of it and worrying in that sense to perhaps again directly address your question have another individual sensitive to such a type they would perceive it in that color again if you did that with that conviction. So then we do have the ability with focused thought to create and filter the white light into as many segments yes and that's what everything really is in fact the white light. So in a sense you are the prisms what in that way defines you as a discrete and distinct personality is the relationship of the prism that you are that breaks down the white light of infinite creation itself to the specific manifestations you consider yourself to be and again as a reminder that prism perhaps as an analogy can be viewed as having three sides one side is your belief systems the second side is your emotionality and the third side is your mentality or thoughts these are the prism for which you literally do. Your reality actually the step down in frequency of some component of the white light. Well in a sense yes for is of a lower vibratory frequency but not step down qualitatively it is only a quantitative densification that does generally take the form that you would call lower vibratory state. Now is it necessary to understand the all of the mechanics of subatomic physics to bring something into physical manifestation of white light. Absolutely not. It is in that sense a matter of your truest conviction and belief system and then also understanding that you have chosen to be in this reality in that sense being cognizant of the choices you have made. One of the choices may have been to not express that and to experience what it feels like not to express that but now you are in the transformational age where one of the shall we say possibilities in the agreements that you make with everyone else to experience certain things these agreements are looser and now perhaps you can decide to change your own particular relationship with the mass agreement and begin to experience different realities but again we remind you and have several times. Are you to be in the presence of other individuals who choose to maintain the agreement though you may manifest something out of thin air those individuals choosing to remain within the agreement will simply not proceed. They will perhaps think you picked it up or have some other explanation. So it is possible to manifest what you are saying and not be able to convince anyone else of it. Is it possible to manifest something in a room, leave the room and someone else walks in and just sees it there like a normal life. Only in that sense if they also are redefining their relationship with the mass agreement. I don't quite understand why that would be involved in this instance. If I were to create a pencil out of thin air and place it on a desk if someone else were to walk into the room would they not be back? We understand. Perhaps they would perceive the pencil but again would not perceive or perhaps believe that you had produced it from thin air. That's fine. So it is possible to create objective reality by through visualization of focusing a thought step down the white light into a solid physical reality without actually understanding all the inner pieces of subatomic physics. Absolutely. But again that is a subjective experience. Thank you a lot. Thank you. I would like to ask two questions on behalf of people that couldn't be here this evening. Oh right. My proxy. Thank you. My friend Martha Serato asked, she saw a craft on the evening of July 13th at 9pm over the Merit Parkway in Trumbull, New York 51 and 52. She asked was that one of your craft and if so was there a purpose in her seeing it at that time? Allow us to answer question number two first. Yes there was a purpose. When individuals will behold something in that sense that runs contrary to everything else they have ever seen in their lives you may just imagine on some level there is a reason for it. In general that reason is the beginning or the allowance of the unlocking from the rigidized shall we say math, the greenness that we have just discussed. So in a sense you may understand the presentation as a particular team that has allowed her and that sense to access a door which will now result in her through curiosity, through joy, through in that sense the simple desire to understand what is happening that she will now attract many new symbols, ideas, people to herself which will allow her to begin to expand her understanding of this. In terms of question number one what we will share is that yes she did perceive an extra terrestrial craft. In terms of its identification for now we will abstain. Thank you. The second question is on behalf of my sister Susan Crow who met with you in private session wants to help interpret her dreams. She's continued to have dreams of extra terrestrial interaction and her most recent dream though confuses her, she was pushing, someone was pushing to enter a room, she was pushing against the door to keep them out. She finally succeeded. A notice came through the door about a UFO conference in New York City coming up and then she felt regret at having kept the door closed and the name William Quinn and an image of a red-headed man came to her. She asked, could I ask you does this signify still an untouched or subconscious fear in allowing communication with extra terrestrial or is this completely a misinterpretation of the dream and who is William Quinn? Well first of all it does represent to some degree a theme but far more does it represent their answer to the fear. Which is if you don't open up we ain't coming in and understand that that is the nature of her agreement. Nothing is forced upon her. There are no battering rams. Therefore it is an indication that it is still up to her meaning that should she still on some level create the fear she may understand that it is her choice not from a situation being forced upon her. And she will meet that individual though perhaps the name will be slightly different. Okay thank you. Oh she also wanted is there a way to actively release the fear she felt that I met this point. When she feels it, utilize what we had began this interaction by sharing it. I now am feeling fear. This is her speaking. Right here right now. First of all I will feel it for delivering a message. I wish to be quite clear in receiving the message therefore I will allow the messenger to speak. I will feel this fear. Really feel it. Allow it to devolve if you will into abject terror. Feel it. Then ask herself. Right here. No past. No future. Right here. Right now. To be fearing with what is right in front of me. What must I believe. And the belief in that sense to utilize your slang liberally will deliver itself upon a silver platter. Then she can decide what to do with it. That may find even after transforming it will sometimes feel fear again. But when she goes through that process will find different beliefs. We perceive approximately two to three shall we say major limiting beliefs which once acknowledged and transformed by choice enjoy in love. Feel it in that sense to say or shall we say cease the effect of the fear. We all thank you. And you as well. We thank you. Oh. Hi. I have two questions. One is business and one is personal. Oh. The personal one. I wonder if you could help me too. I had what I think is an experience with alchemy not too long ago. And it was a literal experience in that sense represented the transformational age itself. And also in that sense represented the eternal nature of the soul now proceed so that everyone else may have some idea of what we are speaking of. Thank you. I had a I have a where a ring a gold ring that turns silver for 24 hours. I mean I knew it turns silver I was still trying to negate the experience. And anyway I decided I mean I'm looking to see what I'm supposed to glean from that person. I got a book on alchemy and I can't see the book is not. So alchemy itself though you may find will perhaps interest you in some aspects is not generally overall the point. The point is the ability of your reality to transform right now. All of a sudden entirely and completely now in general what your silver will represent as a symbol is hidden ideas within you now presenting themselves to the quote unquote surface of your consciousness. The gold in that sense will represent wisdom and will represent the eternal nature again of the soul. So what in that sense you have provided as an elaborate and exciting symbol is simply your willingness to begin to embrace what is preventing itself that was formerly in an understand that nothing that you can possibly discover the supplies to you all about yourself. Nothing cannot be used in a positive way anything that you can discover can be used in a positive way in service to yourself. And that understanding that there is nothing within you that you can discover that can overcome you that can destroy you will give you the liberty and the open willingness to begin to dive into these experiences of transformation and change rather than shall we say slink a step at a time. Does that make sense? Is there something specific with that incident with me or is this just a broad. Do you need more specific than what we have just said? Yes. When you're talking about these hidden ideas is this the specific hidden ideas is the general thing I know that I'm transforming from when we talk the last time as far as communicating and allowing myself to be more me with certain in certain relationships. That is definitely happening. Is that what this is all representative of? In a sense you may understand if you fall under the blanket of all the events as the transformation of your life. The complete transformation the literal recreation for what you did perceive did physically occur and when shall we say turn quote unquote back to goal in that sense literally was a new goal. That's not. Thank you. We thank you. My second question. This is really isn't a question. In my business there's a joint venture that's being negotiated right now with certain people. I would just like to know from your point of view if the people that we're aligning with in this joint venture actually there's several joint ventures but the people that are participating with us are they people that are likely to do business with integrity from the heart and be in alignment with what we want to do. Now it is our perception again that there are several instances and some would in that sense expressed in that way others may not so it will be our simple suggestion to trust your sense of discernment. Do you understand what I mean applying that specifically to your situation? Yes I do. Trust yourself. Okay. And if I'm asking this question actually more from my sister's point of view since she's more actively involved in the negotiation it would be she who should be trusting. Trusting her sense of discernment. Yes. Okay. Thank you very much. And do you? Sure. Stay line. Oh. Last night on television there's a program called citing. Oh yes. That is in a sense one of shall we say very sneakily the methods of dissemination of the information that our society that extraterrestrial societies do in fact exist and that your government knows about them. Now I say sneakily for it is mixed in with a basket with many other things that are generally this believed in your society. So therefore still leaving the option for in that sense not believing new proceeds have been mentioned. I'm very curious because it both I only saw one or two minutes but I mentioned that there are the concentration of fighting over Mexico City. Well you saw the exact one or two moments that were relevant to you. Good. I'm wondering I'm going to be a Mexico City and a few weeks. There is a high degree of likelihood if you go about your business do not obsess or fix it upon it that you will have a physical side against. And one of the reasons for the mass of physical visual sightings in that area is shall we say the interpretation and the attitude and the actions of the people indigenous to that area. For not only are they on mass willing to accept the possibility of our existence but to some degree so is their governmental structure which is in that sense encouraging individuals to explore encouraging individuals to inquire into the subject. An alternative model in that sense for the approach of your United States. Or in that way their internal validation results in the eyes to see what is all about your planet right now. They tied this to the equipment last year. I was in Mexico anyway. But that was simply because of the high degree of video cameras shall we say face up at your sky and in order in that sense amount compared to usual. And therefore since that area is one of high activity by in that sense having so many cameras focused into the sky did result on that particular day in many many individual shall we say videotaping the various craft. If the reason that they are concentrated here because there is a concentration of purer in which focus and you can disseminate energy. Well as we have shared it is more the idea of the indigenous population. However they are as concentrated in many other populated areas but particularly individuals in that area will not create out of mass agreements the eyes to see that. There are far more crafts than you may imagine but you will only see that are you attuned to the vibration and that vibration is not attuned to out of a sense of me out of a sense of I must see this so that I can then validate this reality. These realities are first validated inwardly on some level for only can you express something externally if first it exists in consciousness. So therefore they are far more willing to validate it first as this is one of the reasons of the many that you are now finding yourself attracted to this area. So that has a question. Yes it is. Are you if you are deciding on the one side of the hearingness? From time to time but less in that area. And I think that I will be at the pyramid that you have to walk on in October 11th, and 12th there will be lots of expressions of indigenous culture there will be ceremonies which is not anything. There will be many reawaken and reverse. Among the people who participate. Including yourself. Thank you. And thanks to you for you have done it all. I have done nothing. I am really grateful for your interest in your community and the importance that you stay in. It is an honor for us as well to interact with you and I thank you. Shoot. Oh. Hi, Alan. I would like to ask you about something my father has been creating and experiencing. Oh. Over the past year. It has only happened a few times and I have only just found out about it because he is not one or two about it. My mother would wake up, I suppose in the early hours of the morning, and he would be shaking violently all over. So much so that the whole bed was vibration. And this would go on for about 20 minutes and she couldn't wake him. And she would be terrified but she didn't call for help. She didn't bring for an ambulance or anything. And after about 20 minutes or so he would wake up feeling fine, having no recollection of anything, no dreams, and just get us as normal and go off to work and leave her back. They both asked me about it. Perhaps a week ago I wasn't quite sure what to say. It is our perception that in that particular expression, your father is creating what you sometimes colloquially call a type of seizure and it is the result of the channeling of energy inwardly as opposed to the willingness to express it outwardly. Now there are many nuances and specifics of this but for the purposes of shall we say covering the whole subject that will be. The areas in which you will find he is hesitating, not moving, not doing, will be where it will benefit him the greatest to look at, decides why he is not moving and then perhaps choose to express outwardly that particular assertive energy. Thereby re-channeling that expression. It will make more sense to him. At this time we will pause for a short break of 10 to 15 of your minutes of counting and resume contact at that time.
