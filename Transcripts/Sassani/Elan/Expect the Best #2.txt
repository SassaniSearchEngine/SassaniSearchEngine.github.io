 All right, I'll say before we continue, allow me to say the following. Though you are eternal beings, though you are always existing and have many reincarnational existence for the portion of your existence, so to speak, that you choose to be physical, you have lived many lives, been many different experiences and expressions. Do understand in no uncertain terms that the you you are now only has one life to live. You are only here in the form that you are with the parameters that are laid down once. Therefore perhaps you can say overall your purpose in life is to live that life to the fullest, to be the best you that you can be. We have discussed many times that the sign that you all asked for, oh how can I be the best me, give me a sign is your excitement itself, the vibration of that passion, the vibration of what moves you. Therefore both overall in this life and in every given moment in this life from whatever is right there available to choose from to do. Using the vibration of that excitement will always point you to what is most you. That excitement is your indication of the thing that if you do will be representative of what is most you, the best you you can be. Therefore understand by extension if you determine from what is available in every given moment what excites you the most and then act on that with integrity you will be being the best you you can be and therefore will find it quite effortless to expect the best. Now that note allow us to proceed with the equal interaction and sharing and once again and for the first time thank you all for your willingness to express what to us is always your best foot forward your best side and ask you once again how may I be of service. Sh Oh Oh Hello Greetings to you. Do you have access to communication with Shira at this moment? Perhaps depending upon what it is you wish in that sense to discuss. For you. I was wondering what she did today. What is the curiosity based on? What is the desire for understanding connection? Oh, to what degree? What are you exploring so that I may tap into the specifics? I can't put my finger on it. I feel like there's something I could learn. Oh, right. Perhaps I may rephrase. What did you feel that induced the asking of that question? I feel. Desire for contact. Oh, and perhaps that makes good sense. One of her particular explorations as well as my own as well as what you sometimes call Beshar will be to interface with many different societies. On this particular day as perhaps you would align our day to your day. She was directly in contact with a faction of what you would call Pleiadian consciousness. Since, incarnationally, she had so to speak roots in that system. Therefore, what would perhaps translate to your awareness as desire for contact was the desirous contact that was made. For in a sense, you may understand her to have visited. All right. A past self in that society. Since not only do we travel in that sense through faith, but also through time. And we remind you that your scientists now recognize space and time as space time. One thing. Do you understand? I think I get most of that. You got it all. And you may understand to have connections to that Pleiadian self as well. Though more in that sense peripheral. You experience her joy in reminiscing, so to speak. Does she channel the way you do? Do you mean two others? That is one of the tools that we choose to utilize to approach civilizations slowly. First detecting and sensing the readiness for even this degree of contact. But in general with service society, we refrain from face to face contact at first. Allow me to explain why. Now there are many reasons. Allow me to explain one. As you again consider yourself to be a body, we again remind you that the body is within your consciousness and the body itself has extensions that you do not perceive physically. Sometimes, shall we say a portion of this extension is perceived by some in your society as what you would call an aura or an electromagnetic field. Perhaps for the purposes of this explanation we will call it the bioenergetic field. Your particular bioenergetic field as a society, as individuals in this society contain and again this is colloquial for the purposes of explanation. Gasts within them. Rather than being perceived as continuous in those gaps will represent the portions of yourself, for again you are a whole being, that you do not view as one whole unbroken being. You carve portions of your consciousness up so to speak into segments, into sections and file them subconscious, unconscious, super conscious and so forth. Therefore, this translates physically to your bioenergetic field as perhaps what might be perceived as lack of continuity or gaps. Our particular choice of expression is as a whole being. And before we go on, allow me to reiterate the fact that there is no qualitative difference in your choice and our choice. Our choice is no better than yours. There is no better and worse. Only different. We are talking degrees of quantity, not quality. But our particular bioenergetic field reflects this completely, and perhaps vibrationally speaking will be at a higher frequency rate. For as you vibrate at a lower rate you are literally more dense, hence the density designations. However, when individuals come in close proximity with someone or something with an uninterrupted bioenergetic field, a more accelerated bioenergetic field, there is a particular effect that is created. We have used the analogy of gears being forced together, one moving fast and one moving slow. In that sense when you force the gears together, though to some degree the faster gear will slow down, the far more pronounced effect is for the slower gear to be forced to the new speed. When in that sense our bioenergetic field comes in contact with your own bioenergetic field while it still expresses these gaps, the effect is to force your bioenergetic field of a homogenized field to force you to close those gaps. And how that is perceived by you is all the issues that you have been talking into the closets that you create come to the surface. When they do so all at once unguarded there tends to be a psychotic shock reaction. It is not our desire in any way in interacting with you to in that sense cause this effect. Therefore we in a sense send ahead our intention, send ahead our thoughts in the form of an ambassador such as this and allow you through choice to attract yourself to interaction such as this and then in deciding to incorporate what we are saying automatically by extension you smooth out those gaps. You begin to integrate yourself no longer a separated collection of parts but now beginning one at a time in taking back your responsibility and power to smooth out and fill out your bioenergetic field. Individuals even exploring the topics that we are discussing have less gaps in their bioenergetic field than those simply unaware and unwilling to look at these issues. So to some degree were we to meet face to face the effect that I have shared would be far reduced in an audience such as this audience is orientation. Therefore again we approach slowly and we do so in love and do so with again the extension of the choice from your end to believe it or not it does not matter to us. Thank you. Can I ask more questions? Thank you. I forgot where I was to hear. Welcome to the moment. I feel an acceleration in my creativity and my desire to teach and guide others and help others with their channels. Oh yes and you are doing so. By putting out the message you allow other individuals so seeking that service to find you. Is that interconnected because sure as my future self is that interconnected with something between us. To the degree that you decide yes it is up to you. It does not need to be. It is not that that is the only definition or possibility but it is available should you choose to access it in that way. Again part and parcel of the expression of that energy will always be that energy reminding you and the individuals you interact with that they already contain it and that anything that actually happens to them is a result of what they have done. Not me, not Shira, not anyone else but yourself. That sounds so exciting. Oh wait. Two questions. One is when we think of the Pleiadians I really don't know anything about it. I would like to understand what level the galaxies are at, the different solar systems. Oh wait allow us to be brief and simply explain that of the many expressions of extraterrestrial life. One that is in close observation of your planet is shall we say peripherally to the awareness of your government though not directly. In a civilization that stems so to speak from a system you call the Pleiagism which is a system of stars. Now what is in that sense notable about them being that there are many expressions of life observing your planet to varying degrees is that of all these expressions of life the Pleiadian question would most in that sense resemble your own human physiognomy. They look with only slight exceptions exactly as you look. That is because historically shall we say so wise speaking you have common origins. You are both offshoots of a common central civilization. Therefore now in that sense that that particular society is more blatantly observing and interacting with members of your society there is now more of the opportunity to directly attract them physically and in that sense again they may be unrecognizable as extraterrestrials so do they resemble human. Do I understand the characteristics and qualities of the being of the design and of data in particular what would the basic qualities and characteristics be in the community. Perhaps as an analogy were you to picture your society functioning in the way that we have shared positive interpretation positive attitude and positive action with positive outcome. You would have the Pleiadian in a sense you may understand that they never did choose to explore the degree of negativity that you did but they draw great inspiration in the courage of your society to a done so and in that sense perhaps you can say word and again I am being quite liberally colloquial by your mistakes rather than performing them themselves in that way. So they sound so similar to you what is the difference between the types of science. We are shorter but more telepathically oriented they still speak to some degree and in that sense again are not in constant contact with you. We are different societies with different interests and different in that sense orientations though there is the similarity of the exploration of other galaxies and planets. And your exploration, you live spontaneously is that different for them? Similar, but perhaps you can say a bit more similar to your own as well. Again I understand that this may not translate completely but it is in that sense the best I can do right now. I appreciate it. Oh thank you. Can I ask you questions there? You can add them. I think boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, the traditional fifth or actually third transitional fourth. Though again never having chosen to explore the degree of limitation and negativity that you did. In one sense you can say they are what if you had never explored negativity example and you are there what if they are. Next year it is communicated with a so-called half life in the plié Now is that being part of me as well? Again more peripherally your direct connection is to Chira but one of the reasons that I shared this with you is you can't explore that as well. Do not mean in that shall we say sent to give you too much to do. I know your business. I'm calling out for health like crazy. You're receiving it like singly. I feel quite on the seizure thing and I know that it's a matter of time unfolding. Well perhaps we will see you there. I have some mental questions about it. Is there is there I mean I know that I'm in pain and we all contain all that we need wherever we are so that there isn't a need and a requirement to go there. Right but in that sense as we have shared your excitement is a shall we say communication from what you sometimes call your higher self. So you will be excited about something because in that sense in attracting yourself to it you will discover something there of significance. There is again as we have shared many times a fine line between what you call excitement and anxiety. They are literally the same one energy though the excitement is through the positive interpretation and the anxiety is through the negative. If I don't go near I won't discover that or take longer to discover that. You will discover either way. Perhaps one will be the discovery of what happens when you follow your excitement and one will be the discovery of what happens when you don't. I am as I have shared becoming third density word death. All right my excitement to be there but it's not my time to create a financial problem and also my kids don't want me to go. I want to go near one to attune your vocabulary two hours. We do not in that sense buy into what you call problem and choose to redefine that as a situation that you have not allowed to transform. Problem in that sense implies something unmovable, immutable and there is no such thing. So what is the situation that you are not allowed to transform? Is it perhaps the issue in and of itself that what excites you will support you when you act upon it with integrity? Oh, I'm going to join. Now you're not. Well it would be easier for me to test that if I wasn't supporting my children financially. There is the question of integrity here in terms of being responsible for my finances when I'm responsible for two other people. All right. So what you are saying is my excitement also is to create a life of stability for being my children as well as adventure and open it to expanding. Oh, do you feel that as you expand that you can then utilize this expansion in assistance to them? On emotional and spiritual levels, yes. Do you feel that if you stagnate in that sense, though again you really never do, but if you feel that you do, that you will be as much of a assistant student? But I never stand here. I'm always working on myself, taking workshops that would would draw out the couple of thousands of dollars that we're talking about here. So I don't stand here. Oh, what will you do? Wait. Well, that's one thing. How must you are instructing me in that sense to stand by? I don't understand. Are you telling me to wait or are you saying you will wait? Oh, I'm waiting to get some real clarity on financials. Oh, then you are doing something. So if that is your perspective, our suggestion would be to keep your eyes out and not insist that there is only one form that the particular abundance necessary to allow you to do the thing you wish will come. If you insist and rigidize the only way I can do this is, for instance, the money that you will miss any other opportunity that may come along that will bring you that expression in a path of less resistance than the money itself. Perhaps what will behoove you along these lines to instill as a perspective will be to some degree what we have already discussed with you. If it excites you, maintain it as a clear intention. This is what I intend to do. Look in the moment you are in right here right now. Can I do anything about Egypt right now? No. Can't do this guy? No. Maintain the clear intention. Act from what is available using your excitement to choose and your integrity in performing the action. By doing so and maintaining any clear intention, if it is in that sense to be a best benefit to you, it will happen. And you can accept the feedback from the reality to tell you in most obvious terms whether you will or won't. Does that make sense and is that useful? Yeah. I sort of was receiving the guidance. But, or however, when the opportunity comes along, that is when action will be required from your hand. When of the things that are available in that moment, one of the things to act on is that opportunity. It will still require your willingness to act. It will not fall on your head. You, in that sense, will need the participatory once the opportunity presents itself. Clear intention following your excitement and when the opportunity comes along, clear action. Very link up to meeting the man I'm looking for there. No comment. It is not the point. And there are more people out coming. But, as you say, and I will again be liberal with your slang, good try. You may not be lying. I am lying. Over there are males. Yes, you lie on bridges. You want to speak? Getting back to the gaps in our field. Oh yeah, that is an analogy, that is moving. OK. The effects of meeting a palladium, would that effect be the same as meeting a person in a higher density? to the fourth density like such as yourself? It would be in that sense lessened, but still to some degree present. It will entirely depend upon the individual, their daily systems, and how much they have invested in the insistence that this is the only life in the universe. It can jar individuals, and can be more, shall we say, nonchalant to others. I see. They are, again, more shall we say, akin to your vibration, for they are still in that third density transitional to fourth. But in assuming the positive integrated perspective, there still is a difference in the bioenergetic fields. Very sacred mystic that you brought this up tonight, because I had been wondering about that, in particular. Well, I would say. And I also wanted to get your perspective of Dr. Greer's method of using lights, sound, and telepathic abilities to find extraterrestrials, let's say, attract them. Oh, what did you wish to know? Well, I'd like to give you my perspective of it first, and I see how it matches with here. So well, I figured that one. Do you believe? My perspective is that if the extraterrestrials are at any given distance, the telepathic connection must be most important at all, because they can sense the clear intent of the humans on this end. Well, again, to some degree, or you cannot, in that sense, shall we say, have your mind read without your participation. Because telepathy is the product of unconditional love. You can very easily from your end shut that down. Do proceed. I wondered how far you think that some of these extraterrestrials can see the lights and hear the sounds that they're playing. Is it a great distance, or is that not an important? Well, understand that the beacon that they follow is not the light or sound. There is the ability through very, shall we say, sensitive instrumentation. To also perceive that from what you would consider to be quite a distance. But thought, the speed of thought, perhaps you can say, is, in the sense, the beacon that they hung in on. And very often, though you may find, some usefulness in perhaps creating at first a translational language, the light and sounds may come in handy. They are far more for the benefits of the human. It is the telepathy that is, in the sense, doing, perhaps, you can say, most are all of the jump. That's what my perspective on that. But the humans in that sense will invest more confidence in the telepathy with all right, a few visual and audio aids. OK. Very good. That answers that question. The other question is about channeling in reference to your society and the history of the channeling from your society's perspective. At our previous channeling, I thought I heard you say that this was something new in your society, that you've only been channeling about 10 years, or is that only to our society? Only to your society, in this particular format, approximately nine of your years. I see. So it's a very old way we judge time. It's a very old thing that you've done for thousands of years there. Well, again, there is the arbitrary overlaying of our time streams. And as we have discussed to some degree, our flow of time differs from your own. Our perception as being located in a different dimension simply has to do with the fact that we create time at a faster flow than you. So you are attuned to proceed within the bandwidth of your flow of time. So when you speak about thousands of your years ago, if it comes quite arbitrary, from my particular perspective, we have been doing so for perhaps you can say hundreds of years. And have become aware of it by first being contacted in that way, but also being aware once in that sense participating in the association of the many worlds that exist, that there was, shall we say, tale of civilizations approached too quickly with disastrous results occurring. Therefore, this is perhaps you can say in certain circumstances the method of choice for first contact. Now, Shira, she can visit a Palladian reincarnational self and experience that life in. In a sense, communicate with it. There will be the simultaneous experience at first, but then there is a reorientation. And they then perceive each other as separate beings. And therefore, you obviously have that ability to be able to do that with Andrew if you wish or if he wish. If I wish, yes. OK. Thank you, Alonie. Oh, thank you. For your creative question and your willingness to ponder the unponderable. There will be but a few moments remaining to this interaction. Shira. Yes. Greetings from both me and my brothers. Greetings to you. I have some questions about our condition once we die and answer the spirit form. Oh, how transformative. Of what are we aware? Are we aware of our past lives? In general, as a cross-sectional slice of what is commonly experienced, you will in that sense at first perceive yourself expanding. However, you can try and play that, please, too. But the idea is you begin to get a sense that what you used to believe was the only thing that you were is but a part of it. The reality that you used to believe you existed within now exists within you. A very simple analogy would be when you quote unquote wake up from your nighttime sleeping dream reality. You in that state are connected to other aspects of yourself. Other literal physical experiences. And while you are quote unquote dreaming, you believe you are within that reality, yes? When you awaken, you say, oh, must have just all been going on inside. The reality I used to think I was in that sense within is now within me. It is very simple. You are dreaming right now, though the definitions of this dream are slightly different from the other style of dream. And this will also begin to change as you consciously live this dream purposefully according to preference. You then knock down the necessity for the dichotomy of one style of dream and another. And it becomes one dream reality. But at first you experience this expansion of this absorption, if you will. Then very often for certain individuals, there will be what you might sometimes. And again, this becomes colloquial. We are rendering this down to what makes sense as physical beings, but it is a non-physical experience. You may, in that sense, review certain aspects of your life. That's that sometimes been supposed in various forms. Looking them over and assessing in a sense where you now stand and how it has allowed you to grow and learn. Then in that sense, you become oriented into an overall, shall we say more expanded reality that you become aware is quite fertile and not buried. From that point on, it becomes even more individual. Whether something specific you were seeking. So I might remember that I was one of Jesus's disciples, for example. For example. For example, I was a new chaser. It was one of his theatrical group. Very often in the reviewing of the life you had just led, you will also in that sense create connections, significance, and analogies to other lives. In general, you will still be very strongly connected to the life you had just led because you are still in general within what you call a linear framework when you are in that style of non-physical, in between, so to speak, non-physical. When I relate to the future life, it will depend on your purposes. In general, no. But when you begin to awaken to the ideas that we are discussing and become more conscious about it, it is an absolute possibility. What would I know about the status of those I left behind that I still care about, that I might even want to be a spirit guide for? Well, in that sense, if they were still, quote unquote, living physical line, you would, shall we say, establish a connection with them. And it would simply be obvious from the goings on of your, and again, this becomes colloquial, daily life in that reality, know how that would apply to those quote unquote loved ones. But it is an option. And perhaps you can say part and parcel of the orientation itself. For very often, within what you call an orientation period of this type, you will either attract other individuals that you have known who have died, long lost cousin, long lost friend, grandfather, but also very often they will simply be a representation of your own consciousness, having perhaps already reincarnated, and will be presented to you in a form that you will be most comfortable. So it can literally be those individuals. It can be your version of them that you will interact within, assuming an orientation to that particular style or expression of your consciousness. That may be the answer to my next question, which was, Bashar had told me a year ago so that my parents had both reincarnated, but would I still be able to somehow communicate to them? Well, understand that you may be doing so literally telepathically in this life, but also understand again the following. And again, this becomes confusing. We are speaking about infinite concepts through finite means. But the over soul is eternal, multidimensional, simultaneous, always existing. So even if there is the reincarnation, there is still, shall we say, the presence of the over soul. So you can from time to time, depending on the purposes in general, it is rare. But shall we stay in touch with that aspect of the over soul that you relate to and identify as the deceased individual? Once I die and go into spirit form, what would be my awareness or association with my over soul? Well, again, in that expansion, you come to realize that you are the over soul. When you speak about connecting to an over soul, that is from the presumption of being separated and is again colloquial and not accurate. You can create the seemingness of the separation. But you are your over soul, inseparable. Simply at that point, you begin to realize it and acknowledge it, which you can do before traveling. And in that condition, do I know everything? You know what you need to know. Because you are still exploring expansion in a linear way, very often, you will still impose certain degrees of, shall we say, trains of form. Well, my wish become instant reality. Hey, you will have no time lag between the thinking of the thing and the manifestation of the reality. That is one of the physical definitions in this type of reality, having a thought, performing a series of steps to manifest it. In that particular non-physical reality, as well as aspect of your sleeping dream reality, the having of the thought automatically is the having of the experience. This is why very often in sleeping dreams, individuals will go from one particular scenario to an entirely different scenario, entirely unrelated, think nothing of it, wake up and then say, oh my, I went from here to there and didn't even notice the difference. That is an example of the changing, the immediate conforming of the reality to the mere changing of the thought and belief. Will I be able to relate directly to all that is? Oh, yes, and already, that is not something you would achieve. That is something you always contain. For quite literally, you are not separate from all that is, otherwise it would be all that is, and you are all that is. Then why do I have to progress further to be one with God? You do not. Why are you assuming that you do? You can simply assume that you are already one with all that is. Use your imagination to see how you would act if you truly believe that and begin to act that way. Then you will get the evidence you are seeking. Because I have the idea that the progression we talk about third to fourth, fourth to fifth, non-physical, and non-offwards is to become the ultimate objective of being one with God. That is a very third-density way to look at. Let's look at it. Understand, you can look at it from the perspective of lacking and growing and achieving and becoming, or you can simply look at it from the same aspect of all that is, or you are oversold, and simply being, period, just because. I think so. Do you understand? I am not sure. I am going to have to listen to this tape so you can see the. Well, you can go that route, or you can ask another question. Sit up to you. Well, one of the aspects that's almost a little bit is that we see we are multi-dimensional. I'm not really sure what that really means. Well, one of what we have been discussing is the expression of that multi-dimensional. The fact that you are even considering many of these ideas is your version of beginning to express that multi-dimensional. It is the assumption of uni dimensionality that gives you the effect that you have now. But you are beginning to entertain the thoughts and beliefs in the other realities, and are therefore beginning right here, right now, to express multi-dimensional approach. One time when I asked about the Bigfoot, I was told, well, Bigfoot is really in a different dimension. But once in a while, slips into our dimension, and that's when we see him. In a dimension? Then he disappears, maybe, right in front of our eyes, maybe. Perhaps you may understand that there are overlapping areas of dimensionality. It is perhaps not a purposeful of them popping in and popping in. They go about their business, and there is overlapping whereby individuals then afford themselves the eye to see beyond the quote, unquote norm. It's one example of my being a multi-dimensional entity that I can be in two different places at the same time, is that an example? Well, you already are. But you are not expressing the awareness of it. There is sometimes what you call the lead through from some of these other realities. If what you are doing has a relevance, and something comes up as a memory, it is, in general, that reality occurring right now simultaneously and you having the bleed through because there is some relevance. Just one last quickie here that says everything is connected. It's got to be connected. I find in the whole real last two, three months, maybe, that I'm sort of sleepy and tired when I wouldn't expect it. And my question is, I would like to believe that maybe I'm being rewired for something better, more progressive, enlightenment, whatever. Can you comment on this? We would prefer for the analogy of symbology, for you to simply understand that the wiring is already all-vein. You are simply now beginning to use more of it. That is more accurate. You are beginning to now, shall we say, express your full potential. Remembering some of what I've forgotten. I am using it to make it relevant, which then gives you more, remember. Wonderful. Thank you very much. And we have. Sure. Anyone? Oh. Oh. My first time. Sure. It is my first time, I think. I guess the thing that I'm listening to all this, and I have just recently become interested in all the stone chambers. I went on crystals, stone chambers, and cross circles and whatnot. I guess what I'd like to question. What is the purpose of my life? I've raised two children. I've been divorced. I'm trying to find a way to go right now. Oh, and may I have you a simple question? From all the things that you are aware, what truly excites you the most? I don't know. Well, first of all, yes, you did. Now, that you realize that you know what it is, and that you are aware of the things that you are aware of. We do understand that many of the things that excite you individually are things that you are talked out of by your society. But for the purposes of this identification, push that all aside. Do not. Yes, OK. Again, we have asked what flows your own. I'm sitting here. I've been looking at stone chambers. I've got to go to a lecture at cross circle tomorrow and here tonight. I'm a uni-programmer. I've been doing a project on the side. I'm not real happy with my job. I want something a little more interesting. Oh, are you going to tell me each thing that does not excite you so that you may eliminate one at a time? Or will you simply cut through it all and tell me what? Don't. Excite. Oh, as you say, play a game with this. Where I can answer you a bright and shiny, black lamp and say, if you rub this, you can do whatever is you wish. What would you wish for? A man named Tom. Oh, I did not say who. What to do would you wish to do? What to do? I would be with him. I would say no. What would you do? What truly excites you to do? Perhaps you can share that with him later. But for now, you to do. If you had your, as you say, drubbers. Computer programming. It's doing something different than what I'm doing. I was doing computer graphics and I looked at computer graphics. But I can't do it around here. Why? And where has that assumption come from? It is, as you say, a lucrative field. Why have you defined this is what I wish to do? No one's interested in it. No, I could do it in California, so I don't want to move. You can do it here as well. Where have you placed within your definitions that this is so geographic? Because, I didn't. But I left my last job. I couldn't find another job in computer graphics. I looked. I looked and looked and looked and looked. And there was just that scene of anything going on. So what you are perhaps saying to me is that there is something that you wish to do and you have so far found no one who is already doing it. Correct? Well, I still do. Nobody in this area. Oh, then it would appear to me that you have the corner on the market. Now the question is, when will you decide that you deserve nothing less than that? And that by simply being excited to do that, you are most able to do that. It is most effortless for you to do that. It will be a great joy and lead you to the next thing to do to do that. Do you understand the point? I think so. Understand that what you consider to be perfections upon your planet were not always profession. Someone came along and said, there's a need here. It excites me to do this. Well, there's no one else around doing it. I'll start. Are you willing to treat yourself with that much respect? I'm serious. Oh, very good. Why did I say very good? I'll tell you. Because you cannot get rid of fear. There's nowhere to live. You are the universe. There is no outside. However, fear is a creation, like anything else. And your emotions are always a direct result of what you believe. So by identifying the fear, feeling the fear, you can establish within you what you must be leading to be feeling. Once you have that belief, perhaps the belief that you do not create your own reality. Then you can pray the opposite belief. I do create my own reality. Try that on for size. How does that feel? Not beautiful. See yourself now, the self that believes that and feels that, what are they doing in the situation that you are in? Why they are making some phone calls. They are attracting individuals, doing some research. Setting up the parameters. Then follow that view. Even though some residual fear may be present, you will be saying to that fear, all right, I acknowledge that I feel this because I believe that. And therefore, I acted like I believe that. But now I am acting like I believe this. And reminding myself that I do believe this, you will then again recreate that good. Positive, as you say, fear. The bottom line is to honor and respect what excites you and with your integrity. Understanding that everything is all one thing, integrated, acting on that excitement to whatever degree you can in any given moment. Is that of the systems you do not sound sure? Well, I mean, I've done a lot. I believe in the power of positive thinking and all that. I find it very difficult to do. Well, that is the bottom line. The power of positive action and the true power of positive thinking is the power to then perform the action. For it has no power if there is not an action behind it. So therefore, you have gotten the result already. Understand, you have already gotten a result, the result of the hesitation, the result of refusing to acknowledge the excitement. Therefore, you may now understand that should you choose to honor within you that excitement, you will get a result as intense, though more of a reflection of your preference rather than random. Perhaps it all boils down to, get chinky. But while you are even performing those actions, always look what is in front of you, what the choices are, and only choose the thing from what is available in any given moment that actually excites you, even if it has nothing to do with the computers and the graphics. Trust that the fact that it excites you means it does have something to do with the computer and the graphics. For if you are excited about one thing and excited about something seemingly totally unrelated, the excitement is what tells you they are related. And by acting on what is available with integrity, you generate a new set of results. Those set of results put in front of you different things that wouldn't have been there to choose from, to then use that excitement to act upon. The whole picture will change the moment you take any action and then truck that action, continue to perform those actions according to your excitement. And if the fear comes up, embrace it, use it. It is your creation. You have created it to again be a window to a belief which no longer serves you. Therefore, by doing what I am suggesting, you are using it all and then choosing what you wish, rather than seeing what cards you are dealt. Does that make it a little bit more accessible? I will try. Oh, now. All the trying in the world is simply the doing of trying and not the doing of the thing. Simply resolve to remove trying which implies I may fail and simply go forth and do it because you say so, because it serves you, because you love it. Therefore, it will serve others and is within full integrity. You deserve it. Thank you. Oh, and thank you. I have done that. Is that all? Yes, thank you. Before, in that sense, we depart. Male in this area. Is there a question or statement? Do you say that? Do you say that? Do you say that? Do you say that I have something when my mother or mother was not talking to you? Oh, I'm not. How are you? Perfect. I'm perfect also. But was not talking to you either. I have a question. I'll write. Proceed. From the first time I heard the Shara tapes, I realized that I was being drawn to this energy. Bashaar. Bashaar. Hey, do proceed. I'm here tonight. Can you tell me why I'm here? You are here because you are now willing in that sense to begin to think that it's just like impossible to create the life that you desire in service of self and, therefore, by extension, in service of others. You are here this evening because there are many unanswered questions within you. Things that lie beyond the sight, beyond the sound, that you have began to understand do have existence. You are here because you are now expressing your willingness to begin to collect back what you have again, then defined to be the many parts of yourself, and begin to function as an integrated, complete, being in service, in love, in life. Opening up the channels and opening up the pathways to communicating with the many other portions of yourself and the many other portions of, shall we say, expressions of civilizations throughout the multiverse. Now, why do you think you are here? There's something very strong in the energy that suggests perhaps a kinship I have been told from another channel and something that's very difficult to believe that I'm from a different dimension. Well, perhaps to you. In my reality, that is commonplace. I believe. Now, how does that serve you and how can the utilization of this information be applied? That's something I'm still struggling with. Well, perhaps that is perhaps the first place to look. Why struggle? Simply allow it to be as obvious as it is, and whatever is not obvious, it is not obvious, trust that it is not now the timing to look at. Struggling, in that sense, usually implies trying, attempting, but not quite simply allowing. Everything will become obvious. You do create, in this reality, as part of your physical beingness, time, linear time, and therefore timing. Simply trust and all will become apparent. In perfect timing. And it is true, as I have heard, that certain things will unfold at their time, no matter how much we struggle to speed the process up. Well, in a sense. But the idea is that you can simply allow. The struggling implies a foiled attempt. The allowance is simply letting it happen. And utilizing an elaborate system of feedback with the reality that you're in to tell you of the timing. Well, this is not available. Obviously, this is not the timing. But this still excites me, so I will keep it as a clear intention and act on what is available. That then allows you to recognize and acknowledge the timing, and still in that sense keep doing and moving without interrupting yourself. That would explain why I keep being drawn to certain healing techniques and approaching one after the other, even though I have no way of utilizing math the moment. But that's the thing that excites me. That's where I feel drawn to go. You are collecting knowledge and resources that perhaps, in that sense, colloquially speaking, will come in handy later, yes. Trust that excitement, but also again, trust the fact that the timing is not forthcoming right now. Trust it. Also understand, all of you create your own reality, not only you, not only you, all of you. Therefore, you can never truly heal anyone else. You can create a conducive atmosphere. But the healing and the disheasing is always created by each individual. The utilization of this knowledge puts the ball back in each perspective person's court and perhaps gives you an advantage in understanding, that you are only a conducive conduit, a catalyst, an atmosphere. When a person will match you, heal themselves, and perhaps they'll thank you, you have healed me. What perhaps will set you apart from others is you will then say, well, perhaps this is a bit sneaky, but I am telling you you have healed yourself. In no uncertain terms. Then you are providing a full service. Then you are allowing them to take back their own power and have performed a useful integrative service as well. Is this the best? Yes, it is. Thank you very much. And to you. At this timing, allow us once again and for the first time. To thank you all and express our love unconditionally and our appreciation and gratitude for your willingness to show us your best, for we expect the best from you and you have not once let us down. You too can begin to expect the best from yourself and your willingness again to simply before performing an automatic negative action, to evaluate, to conjure up, to provide just one little alternative. Can be in and of itself enough of a shift in your perspective to entirely transform your life. If your actions become all positively oriented, not only will you get positive results as we have in that sense, suggested that you will, but you will do so quite quickly and what accelerates your reality to the creation of that reality in preference is your willingness to act this way. Therefore, you do not escape or run from the old non-preferred you. You simply, in walking toward the new preferred you, distance yourself by convention from that old non-preferred you. Automatic. You are not running from anything. You are walking toward what is now most representative of the best that you can be. We thank you and bid you a most fond and loving. Good evening.
