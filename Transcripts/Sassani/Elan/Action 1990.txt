 I'm going to leave it. All right, I'll say how are you all this evening of the old time as you create time to exist? Good evening. Good evening. We're perfect. How about you? The beginning of this interaction is evening of your time with a reiteration and clarification of some of the ideas we have to face you last evening of your time. We discussed the delineated with you last evening of your time, the idea of how you may have your head in the clouds, keeping your feet firmly planted upon the ground. The idea behind this reasoning that we have presented to you was that you are physical beings functioning in a physical way. You have chosen, although some of you have created the idea of forgetting that you have done so, but you have chosen the idea of being physical after time. The ultimate manifestation of the idea of idea into physicality will be translated as that idea of action. We also delineated the steps toward igniting your physical reality as being clear in tension, clear definition, desire, deserability, and clear action. We shall, at this time, draw a distinction between the idea of clear intention and the idea of clear definition. Clear intention can be defined as what it is that you desire to do. Clear intention can be... Realize in an individual way by each individual, by the idea of excitement. In other words, what we are saying is that what excites you the most, being the physical translation of the vibration of that which is most you, that which does excite you the most, can be your intention. So you will define your intention clearly by relying on your faculty of excitement, your individualized, personalized faculty of excitement, that again allows you to know what your purpose is on a moment to moment basis, purpose just meaning that action, which is most reflective of, that which you have become physical to experience. The idea of clear definition in contrast is more the idea of how you plan to go about carrying out your intention. There have been many claims of all in your society using the principles of visualization, the idea of picturing in your mind what it is that you wish to achieve, and repetitively holding it there, in order to define clearly the direction you will be moving towards. We suggest that although this is a very powerful goal, that when you do partake in such visualization, that you are very unspecific, very vague in lying down the parameters of how you will allow the manifestations to come about by placing in these visualizations to many regions, specific parameters, to how you will allow that reality to manifest, you are not always privy as your higher self is, to the information and in all encompassing fashion, allowing you to see which will be the path of resistance for that manifestation to take, understanding that it will always take that path of resistance, and being again a focused being, and not necessarily at all moments allowing yourself to be privy to the wholeness of your being, you may lay down parameters which in order to satisfy, and they can be satisfied in that manner, you may be placing an inordinately long period of time as you create time for the manifestation to come about. So our suggestion to you will be to use the idea of visualization in more of a vague manner than maybe you have. This will allow the path of resistance of manifestation to be achieved, and you will notice that the path of all the resistance takes in your turn the least time. Now once you have defined and determined what this intention shall be, what this definition of vague with, how or what steps are immediately within your grasp today, you already have the desire, we have already explained to you our ideas, our perspectives on deserved ability, and although many of you are still wrestling with this idea, you do mainly have it out shall we say, we are now left with the following and final stage of clear action. Many times individuals in your society will begin to enter into what you call spirituality and begin to understand that manifesting physical reality does begin on a mental or spiritual level, a causal level. Often they then formulate their desires, formulate their intention, and the only action that they do takes and the action of sitting around and waiting for the manifestation to happen. We suggest being born, not meaning this, and a conflicting sense, but aggressive with the idea of action, formulating again that action, which is most available to you at this time with this as our parameters, but what you shall notice by following your excitement, by taking action behind the excitement that you have, that many other opportunities that are seemingly unrelated to that which you immediately have access to, we'll start popping up. We have always said that we can only deliver this information to you, that we cannot prove it to you, but however, you can prove it to yourself, and we are shall we say using your vernacular, handing you the keys to do so. This particular group has a lot of momentum behind it. It is not necessarily that the clear intention of the group need be one particular thing or another particular thing. There may be many clear intentions. As many as there are individuals in the group, and sometimes individuals may have more than one. But we suggest that at this time you open up a more specific dialogue to start to discuss and bring to life and to forefront what these intentions are, and similarly moving on to the next step out. So, the definitions of what is now available to you to start taking these courses of action. The momentum of which we have spoken behind this group, which is great, will translate very quickly according to your time into manifestations. There have been many phases of the group owning a co-easiveness. We have spoken to you last evening of your old time about an initiation. We did not mean at that time that the initiation was to only include the idea of that particular evening. The initiation is an ongoing process, which in some sense had begun on a particular level that evening, but is now also continuing. What will accelerate this idea is the action step of the formula we have lied out for you. We have and have made an agreement between our civilization and the physiological child. This agreement in part was misunderstood by the physiological child. Our part of the bargain, sort of saying, was that we will be present in your weekend. In a physical sense, as well as allowing our energy to be popped into. Although you all directly experience that energy being popped into, through what you have labeled the child. Through what you have labeled communication with anima and b√©char, which are simply labeled to describe us and not actually our names, but we are individual, physiological beings. There also was a physical visitation, a physical visitation from us. However, we have proceeded in a different manner than we have in your past. We exist on what you may label a more a theoretic and more dreamlike level than your aspect of physicality. In order for you to physically cite our spacecraft, a certain process which we may label, but it is not a really an accurate representation of the process. Only that there is not the language available to us through the channel at this time to describe it, but we will call it and then use all what we have, densification. In order for us to interact with you on a blatant level, we must undergo a process of densifying ourselves, densifying our vessels. This densification may achieve many levels in order for your typical representation of third density, your manifold being to perceive us. We must densify ourselves to a great degree. As one transformed from the idea of third vibrational state of reality to fourth vibrational state of reality or fourth density, the physical vibration of the being does rise. We have spoken the past of when we did have with you blatant physical interaction that it would be of a nature where we have met each other halfway. Our level of densification within our visitation of you was, shall we say, for a reference point lower down than halfway, but not quite to the point that you would physically be able to perceive us unless a great deal of your underlying this word action has accelerated your vibration to the point that will meet us. What I am saying is simple this. You cannot perceive, you cannot experience a reality that you are not the vibration of. We were here, we densified to a level to which you could meet and match us, but as you say, the bottom line was, you did not. This is not to say in any way shape or form that we are denigrating or criticizing you. We are simply to use your colloquial language to raise our standard of it. We have done this not to tease you, we have done this not to dangle the carrot out in front of you as you say. We have done this as, and we do not mean this in a competitive way, they challenge to you to meet our vibration, or we will less than halfway. Therefore, we shall tie this all together. We have suggested to you the formula, the idea of ignition of your physical reality by allowing yourself to get to a relaxing stage, and each and every endeavor you will inevitably raise your physical vibration, not only in an overall sense, but in an experiential sense also. The ecstatic explosion of coincidence that we have described to you hinges on your taking action on what excites you the most. The action step is the step that begins the process. Once that ecstatic explosion of coincidence begins, we will put it this way, there is no stopping it. Therefore, there is no reason for hesitation. We understand that your no pain, no gain for asking, has in this regard held you back. We understand that you must struggle and strive and work very hard otherwise your way is another of your perceptions that holds you back. But realize that you have said, changing a belief is an easy way to figure out what the belief is that you do already have, and be wording the opposite belief, making it as a statement, and then, and here's the key, progressing in action. As though you already believe that, it is your actions which are ultimately, physically, a measure of your beliefs, not the nice philosophies you can impart to other individuals. By as we have called it, walking your talk, it becomes obvious to other individuals that what you are saying has merit on that level, and that it no convincing to be done. Therefore, acting on what excites you the most serves many purposes, only one of which is to initiate this ecstatic explosion of coincidence. And I ask for you at this time, there will be other opportunities for you to perceive our spacecraft, there will be opportunities for you to pipe into the water. And if you are going to pipe into our stream of consciousness on an individual level, this can only be achieved by each and every one of you through the degree that you allow such an interaction. And through the degree that you validate such an interaction and do not invalidate it. The physiological child does allow himself to flow this information to you, to trust this information, to utilize the suggestions that we are constantly giving him. The delivery of the material which we are conveying to you the teasing of your time and the material that shall come shall be shall we say a bit sweeter, a bit more fluid. There is a great difference in the allowance on the part of the child. This evening of the old time, the last evening of the old time, and this is far so we do to some of the suggestions we have made, having been followed. Each and every one of you having whole life through our stream of consciousness may from time to time experience the idea in your thoughts of suggestions. If you harness that that the suggestions are promise, it is not to say that you will not manifest and progress just as well without them, but we do all for them to you have tried and true ways in which you may accelerate toward creating and manifesting the life which you do prefer. In return for your willingness to co-create this interaction with us, in the return for your willingness to act as ambassadors for your civilization, and allowing me to act as ambassadors for our respective civilization, I ask you now how may I be of service to you? For sure, this is Tiso, I'm an electrical engineer, and because of that, when I hear vibration, I first think of a sinusoidal wave of electricity. Can you clarify more to me what is the nature of the unique vibration of an individual and at the fighting experience where you're referring to the vibration of the entire group somehow integrated? Thank you very much. The idea of vibration upon the way that you have represented in your flat is more of a pictorial representation, a representation which only on a very surface level describes but a mere and small atmosphere. The small aspect of the idea of vibration, the exercise which we had shared with you last evening of your time, which we asked you to picture upon the skin of the bubble of the energy you see that is your being the best way for us to answer this question, being that again, there is quite a lack of vocabulary within the channel, and a lack of vocabulary within your language to describe the fullness and wholeness of this idea. How you may get in touch more closely and firmly with the idea is by getting yourself into your meditative state, recreating the energy she's bubble we have shared and discussed with you. When at that point in our guide visualization, we had asked you to visualize the vibration of the skin of your bubble. One moment. They asked you a question. Yes. When we did ask you to visualize that vibration. At that time, what were the impressions you received? If I recall correctly, we were also tuned into the seven and a half cycles per second. Correct. Correct. But this was after we had initially asked you to familiarize yourself with your own particular vibration. At that point, prior to the synchronization to the electromagnetic field of your own, prior to the synchronization of another individual in your group, when you were just capturing your own individual signature vibration, do you remember what the impression you received was? I visualize the bubble and the physical description you described, but because of my hang-up and confusion as to, am I looking for a wavelength or a signal on a CRT tube, if you will? Am I looking for a combination of a whole bunch of sinusoids? What is it that I'm looking for or trying to imagine when you use the word my signature vibration? Oh, all right. I understand your question. One moment. At that time, for that exercise, whatever it was you were picturing, whatever pictorial representation you had for vibration was sufficient for that exercise. However, the vibration which we discussed with you as your signature vibration, although it may have those pictorial representations, the best way that you can understand and have a grasp of this idea of this type of vibration is experientially. And we suggest that you go back into that type of visualization, meditation, and instead of picturing a particular vibration in a particular part of the bubble, the skin or the content of the bubble, simply tune in and allow yourself to feel the vibration of your self experientially. When you have come to terms with this idea, no matter what form, it winds up presenting itself to you, then please again share with us, and we will at that point continue the conversation in regards to the second question of your own, the question of whether the vibration was a composite vibration of the group or individual vibration. Although the most proper answer would be both, the more specific answer which you see is individual vibration. So, I'll point out the interest to you and in closing this idea. If any one single individual in your group has vibrated to the level, the level that we have, densified ourselves that, that one single individual would have perceived us, although the rest of the group would have not. When enough of the individual vibrations of the group have raised the collective vibration of the group to a particular point, that may not be so much as a prominent occurrence. In other words, if an majority of the group is vibrating at such a level, that any of itself may be enough all collective vibrations to allow others in the group would not necessarily vibrate at their ideas to experience a silence. This can vary from a solid physical sign on their part to a more inferior ghostly type of silence. There will be more of a tendency in those individuals to have the reaction we have to describe to you, the fear reaction, the unfounded fear reaction, unfounded because there is nothing inherently fearful about these interactions, only by forcing a vibration up to a level that it has not chosen, had not taken the action to get itself to. This forces many things to the surface that are the reasons that have helped these individuals back from taking the action that will raise their vibration. There may be some dampening effect to this idea because of the overall group energy. But when we have described to you that this reaction takes place, we may not have conveyed to you the intensity which it does take place. It is more of a psychotic fear reaction, much in excess of what you call, palpitation, fear reaction. So as you can see, it would not be desirable for us with what we wish to convey and share with you to be responsible for or to stop a reaction from an individual. But we will keep trying and as you ask, you will make more conducive the atmosphere where one day we may need faith to faith. Does this answer the question is a vision point? Yes, thank you for that clarification. We will keep trying also. If you give a little help with regards to the answers this day, when you are trying to achieve a higher density to perceive a sighting, it is difficult for us to get into a meditative fate per se, raise our vibration and still see the physical eyes. Can you help a little bit with that interaction between the physical body and the higher vibrations? Can you replay that question? In her meditation, it seems the easiest form for us to raise our vibration. One moment, one moment. Are you talking about being out within a sight and meditating while waiting for contact? Yes. Prosy, had we done that, can you help us also achieve the sighting with our physical eyes while we are in the meditative state? It is difficult for us to segregate those two bodies, meditative body and the physical eyes. The idea is that sitting, even in a powerful group such as this, any circle and meditating, is not the type of change in vibration of which we speak. It is all well and good and we are not putting it down. Four thousand, if you ate a momentum. But what we are talking about is changing the action in your everyday life for it is the action. When followed using excitement as the barometer, that will, in a physical sense, raise your vibration to the level of which we speak. Does this answer your question? Thank you. Sherry? I'm shocked. As you could say. I'm doing what excites me the most. I think every day. I feel that I am. It gets better and better and better with every action. My interactions with people. Oh my goodness. Good. I have a situation going for a long time. I have started up. I have back every day for a long time. I have also developed a new problem on my eyes. I was wondering if you could reflect me why I am creating that. May I ask you a question? Sure. Which part of your back is affected? It's the upper right now. It's the upper right behind the shoulder blade. If I move a certain way, I have pain. I have lower back pain and it's gone and gone and I don't have it now but it's gone and goes. When was? As you say the last, the cause of the lower back pain? I had about a week ago, which caused my attitude down my legs. And then what I did is my communications with myself and my body and using the real white light, you know, I worked with that and that sort of dissipated. Because I know I've learned that you can't get rid of anything. That he goes? You know, I know that. So it's like I'm trying to work with that blue-white light but it's like it's been ongoing for such a long time. Then I just stopped doing everything on it. I feel like I'm putting too much effort into it. In exactly the way that you are experiencing the pain at this moment, all of you experiencing the pain at this moment of your time? Right now as I don't know but if I move my head a certain way, yes. Ah, as you experienced that pain. What is it that you get out of it? Approach it from that perspective. Ask yourself in an honest fashion. And without placing Judge Miss Apana, immediately answer. How exactly as it is if it serves in you? My immediate answer on that is it's like a symbol that I'm still working through things in my life. It's like the last residual bit of stuff that I'm dealing with in protecting my body or bringing my body to full health. Oh, right, you are accelerating. Go on. That's it. That's all I know right now. That's what I see right now. Have you as you have suggested begun to view yourself in a homogenous manner instead of a collection of parts? Yes, I do that. At night I do pretty deep breaths and I say to myself, I am one homogenous being. So I am working with that. What is the effect of that? I just relax with it and I like love myself with it. At that moment all are you experiencing the pain? No, I am not. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. That's a key for me then to look at it that way. So then if I take that and reflect to myself as being one homogenous being and sort of like act like it. You have gotten the idea very nicely. Many times the questions that you do ask of us, you can pay the answer all right there, nicely packaged. Right. Yeah, I know that. But I've been asking that question myself for a long time. Sometimes you have set up a belief system whereby you set up a seeming outer validation. We have served this purpose and we thank you for allowing us to serve this purpose. But let's get down to it. The idea is you have really done it yourself. Yes. You have always been the message that we have given to you. So then I would do that. I would do the same process as far as my eyes are concerned. Yes. The idea will be that there may be some. Shall we say fine tuning that your imagination will do with the process. One of the ideas of allowance and usage of your faculty of imagination is to allow it to do so. So you may wish to experiment with the idea of using the process we have conveyed to you as a guideline. And while your imagination to super impose whatever idiosyncrasies will work for you. That's good because I don't feel like there's anything quote unquote wrong with me. You know, it's not. Well more than we. Well, that's good. I can set the force too. But it's just that because it kept going, it's been going on for such a long time. All right, all right. Understand another thing we shared with you within our exercise last evening of your time was the, as we call it, catch phrase, that the present is not a result of the past. You are in this instance. Using your lingering ideas that the present is a result of the past. And I don't mean this in a dramatic or a sense, but an excuse for continuing to manifest the same. Ah, yes. Okay. That helps me a lot. That really indicates more. Does that answer the question? Yeah. Thanks a lot. Sure. As you said before, I, you know, it's every question I formulate. I know that I can actually, you know, bring myself time off of my own. I have to do it. Yes. The thing that's been like puzzling to me, given this group has been working with talent. And, uh, an entity we've been in, in two states and one by the name of six. Metaphid, or, give the famous monitor. Yet we all wear it all without energy. He has said that the, uh, an entity from the Great Lakes brotherhood has been in communication with me. And I don't get it. I, I feel there's a presence around me and some energy communicating with me. And, and may I ask you a question? Yes. Does it excite you that this energy would be the white brotherhood? Not really. Then any label from the monitor perspective that you make waste upon is not important. Proceed with your question. I don't know what the question was. I didn't know how to formulate a question regarding it. Um, I don't, I don't know the health question. Does it excite you as you say, child? Yes, and I don't know particularly in the manner that, uh, when you close your eyes and placing no judgment upon it, picture yourself channeling what you see. I see myself not being able to present for the interaction and that doesn't like totally excite me. I'd like to be there. I'd like to see what was going on. So now do the same thing with your staff, the decline to yourself and only visualize that which excite you and then describe. Does not serve you too much to describe what doesn't excite you. I really have a strong desire to assist others and assist myself. They do. They don't, they don't end in here. And I guess the, uh, by serving others, by serving and allowing yourself to be always speaking the best you you can be, you are serving others to the best of your capacity. In a sense, by following your excited, you are serving yourself, the universe and others all in one shot. You do not need to separate these ideas down to subdivision. How is it that you picture yourself being that your question was initially about the idea of childing? How is it that you see yourself being a service to yourself, the universe and others while channeling? Use your imagination and tell us as now if you wish. Well, I get the idea more so, being able to communicate and tap into more aspects or greater consciousness or about it be necessarily like a direct link. I don't know exactly how to say it. Well, using your physical circumstances, what's the matter? Or can you conjure up in your imagination? Do not intellectualize all of the individual components and intentions. Simply describe to me using that wonderful faculty of your imagination, the scenario in which you can picture yourself in any way, shape or form, conveying information that does excite you. The life of the person who came to my mind is that I am doing that. It's an individual interaction that I have with people on a day to day basis, is that what excites me is being able to bring forth a communication level with them to the greatest extent that we can put into that kind of conversation that brings us both to the next level. It's not necessarily a form of channeling as classically we know now is channeling. I guess it answers my question. It's in the evolution of things that I am doing that. Very good! We have perceived that however, there may be some more of a closer format in which you would always like to participate. This is what we all are questioning you about at this time. Do you wish to channel for the group? Yes! Can you picture yourself channeling for the group? Yes, I do. Describe the scenario. No! Close your eyes. Take the big trash. Allow yourself to be drifting there with nothing in front of you, nothing behind you, nothing above or below you. Now picture a room, this room empty. Now for all people sitting in your circle and a chair with you sitting at the head of the circle. Can you see this? Yeah. Please describe the scene. What is it? Maybe sitting. The center of the circle. The circle now. Are you excited? I'm anxious. Are you speaking? Are you writing? I'm judging. Are you painting? No speaking. How are you communicating? Perporn. Does it feel good? Yeah. Do you desire to do this? Yeah. Then we have a final suggestion for you and the answer to your question. Are you ready? Don't watch your image. Well, I'm one of you. Yeah. I do. Go right ahead. The idea is it is that simple. We can't go a step further with this. Oh, yeah? Close your eyes. What are you saying to the group? Do not judge, speak. We shall facilitate. What's that? The group has got come here in peace. Proceed. I'm off already. Most of the emotional, I'm getting it. I don't have a birthday. Oh, all right. You can't try this again in your imagination any time. You can if you wish try again with us pleasant facilitators. If during the impert of the rest of this interaction, there is anything you choose to share. There is anything that talks into your mind as you wish to share. Please do not hesitate to interrupt the interaction. There is not an interruption. Your channeling can be that simple. Does not have to be that you are in a deep trance. It can be very conscious of your channel. The physiological channel before you, although we're involved in this particular aspect of this type of interaction, is in what you may label a deeper type trance. He also has the capability, which he is only now starting to utilize of very light trance communication with our energy. In that state, he can convey ideas, although not so purely to you. So with practice, it would even become so removed from your self, the pressures you had imposed upon yourself, that there must be a particular kind of mind, a particular kind of conscious pushing aside to deliver material. Not to say that that is not possible, not to say that you are not capable of such a thing, only that you are using it as a way that is blocking your communication, because you have said it as a parameter or standard, and that is not this time the path of least resistance for the communications you are having. Maybe that is in the future, as you know time, but at this time you may wish to facilitate and strengthen this communication by simply vocally imparting it to all the members of the group, either when you are congregated as a group or when you are, as you say, individually engaged, you are doing very well, allow yourself to realize that, allow yourself to realize that you deserve communication, if that is what you desire, for you deserve and all argue deserve anything that does excite you, that excite is your particular instrument to hone in on your purposes, both overall and moment to moment purpose. So do not when you count if you want, we suggest that you do not. You find something that is excite, that is within integrity, will not hurt yourself or others, but it may seem to you that it is not very well accepted by society, allow yourself to experience your own version of your vibration. You are not in any way damaging your society by doing what excites you, even if the particular action may seem as those particular individuals that it is not in agreement with their belief system. You are still doing them the best service by not reflecting back to them what they want to hear so that they can have a lot of conversation with themselves. You are doing them the best service by doing what it is that does excite you the most. This allows them the opportunity to see that such a way to proceed is not only possible, but a lot of fun. That is the answer to your questions sufficiently. There will be but a few moments left to this interaction. Sure. For sure I have two questions I think. In answering the first question you may well make it very easy for me to ask the second question. My mother and father were both killed in a traffic accident in January 1964. I would like to know whether each one of them is still in spirit form or whether each one may have reincarnated. What can you tell me about their whereabouts or anything like that? One moment. What is as you say their name? My father was named Wendell R. Minor and my mother was Martha Anne Minor. My father was just turned 65. My mother was 62. We perceive that father has reincarnated upon your planet eyes. Now approximately 14 of your years of age. We perceive that mother had acted as as you call spirit guide until 83. At which time she incarnated eyes. Male approximately age 7. That is all we perceive at this time. When you said one moment what is happening? Are you accessing some universal database? Thank you very much. To some what that idea? Have you been familiarized with the physical device we have called the projections able? No. As I being a physiological individual that I also am, communicate with this physiological channel in your group. I am in orbit around our planet of a society within the confines of my self class. Upon which there is a rectangular table. I am currently in a state of repose upon this table. This table allows me to link my consciousness and mentality with the computer aboard our vessel. Our idea of computer and your idea of computer are very different. It would be very difficult in your terms for me to elaborate with the vocabulary that is available. But suffice to say that our computers, many of them are linked to our mentality. And give us immediate access to information. The totality of the information gained through the exploration of our civilization is contained within the memory of the effects of the better of these computers. So when it thanks to timesay that we have linkage to a universal data bay, there are similar facilities aboard our mother ship, a room which you might label although this is not accurate. It is the closest approximation that we can ask her to say in chapel. This allows us to link our mentality with all that is in the morning shall we say direct level. Upon the surface of our planet, our areas with no structures, very park-like areas, the name of which we'll translate to, Prima, Prima, and that is the designated areas sort of speak upon our planet where we go to, as you would call it, commune with all that is. So when we say one moment, either we are scanning our own consciousness or we are scanning the memory banks of the computers to which our minds are directly linked, the idea being that we do not have keyboards and the way in which we interact with our computers is on an electromagnetic, as you would say, mental level. So we are accessing information from many points. There is, in these beginning interactions, when we first begin to work with physiological channels also a phenomenon whereby the channel, for lack of better terminology gets distracted, and the way in which we know that he is missing out on the information that he has to listen in, this has the tendency to break the flow of communication. So some time that is reason for, as you would call it, the habitation. In the instance where you asked your question about your relatives that have transformed, we were accessing the aspect of our computer memory banks which you make closely, but not exactly, ascribe to what you have labeled in your society, a classic record. Are you familiar with that terminology? No, that's new to me. Very good. We have a homework assignment for you. Can you spell it? I know how to spell it. Okay, Daniel has spell it. That information is available from other individuals receiving of your time. Sherry! Yeah, I got a question. I got two questions. I have two questions. So I had a boyfriend next time. Alright, it's never the same question. Always a new question. Always a new interaction. And we view something that may be worded exactly the same as a new question, and we answer it as so. Started to interrupt you just a little bit. I'd like to know what happened to a boyfriend in my mind that died about five years ago. Nate. Gary, who do you see this? No, I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm sure. I'm sure. I'm sure. I'm sure. I'm sure. What was the approximate age and the approximate year of... When you're 33, it was May 17th and 25th. We perceived our dad individual. Being that this is the transformational time upon your planet. Had chosen. To as you might say, work out a lot of the ideas of integrating, negativity in a very accelerated fashion. Our perception is that this may explain the tumultuous nature of his life, the tumultuous nature of his death. But we perceive that he has reincarnated. One moment. The information. The information. The information. Correction. We perceive at this moment in timing that he is acting as a spirit guy. To a few individuals upon your planet. We perceive that this will occur from your terms of time. A short amount of time upon. And at which time he then shall choose to reincarnate. Although it has not been decided by that individual. If A that definitely shall occur, or B when, who, and how. Does this answer your question? Yes. One second question. One second question. You are always mimicking away from my eyes. Describe. And what I am in the punch of moving in a day, in the red. One of my favorite is real clothes. It looks like a toy. They have no light on the bottom of that unit ground. It would be a close. Proctanately. What was your existence from the Bethel? What is what it means? The second small Bethel of the mile, or the first B one? I see it in one moment. Which one did you see more than one? Just one or just one. How many times? Three separate occasions. A proctanate date. Seven or ten. All three signings within that time. Yeah. The second and third time I am in the first. I can be there, but you know they are there. Your perception of that second Bethel as a toy is based upon what? Okay, it was just because it was so close to you. It was real. The person that was with me would refuse to believe it was there. Did that person, as you say, visually perceive a cross? Sure did. Shape. Up and down. I can be sure that I may be. Have you, through your conscious recognition, had what you would consider, dream contact of any type? I'm not sure that I may be. Have you had anything you might and person as, telepathic communication of any type? In any point of your physical life? Yeah. Subscribe. I don't have any questions to answer. I don't know if you can. Something else you can do then. When you ask questions about the Bethel, you have encountered. What answers do you get to that? Let me know where we are. Does this mechanism of the answering of these questions function on the man? I don't know why. So what? Nothing. One moment. I'm not giving you a hard time. It is only that there is opportunity for communication. We feel in those ways to facilitate that communication most fully, would be for you to take steps of action based on your excitement. Actions are not mean enough to get up and run around the block. Of souls, as you call them, reincarnate upon the same planet that is not always the case. So some of, as you say, the influx of beings will come from reincarnational beings from other systems. One of the other aspects and ideas about this increase in population can come from an idea. Another aspect of what we have called multiple, simultaneous incarnations, that idea being that there is an over soul which in every one of you. And it may manifest several representations, several physical as we have labeled them counterparts as this occurs. And because you are coming to the end of 25,000 years cycle of limitation, let's say there is kind of last minute of rushing. To participate in a lifetime, the manifestation of which the transformation will occur in such an accelerated manner that it has taken hundreds and literally thousands of lifetimes to see and perceive such acceleration. It's a very popular place to be right now. There are other reasons, but for now, will this apply? I hear about Mr. Gorbachev yield to that temptation and just join us recently from another civilization and how do you see his prognosis. Our perception is that he would be more representational of a being reincarnated from Earth. I see. His emergence in society was facilitated by what we will label. And again, in order to delineate this idea, we will do it at another time. But there are many types of what you call dreams. One of the types of dreams that is present is what is known as a mass dream. This is a dream that everybody upon your planet has at the same time, not necessarily that they will bring back recognition and remembrance of the dream, but many key figures in your society, or shall we say introduced to the mass consciousness before their physical arrival by this appearance in what is called mass dream. It is our perception that this is what has occurred with this individual. Thank you. This time, we wish to send our unconditional love and appreciation to each and every one of you for participating in us. This is called creation. We bid you, exciting, dream wise and wide dreams. After any interaction of this impantity and clarity, you can all expect some type of interaction within your dreams receiving of your time. You may wish to, you don't have to, write these down when you awaken in the morning and share them with the group during the course of your week. We appreciate the opportunity to interact with the group such as this, such an advanced group, although we must say now, when we say advanced, we do not mean greater or lesser in terms of a value judgment. We just mean, in terms of a vibration with celebration, fourth density being on our air any better than third density being. They are exactly the same in value. That is why you do not run from one's entity to another. They are equal in value. Therefore, we appreciate and recognize your acceleration of vibration individually and as a group. And we again suggest to you that you use the last step of action as an impetus to proceed. We have in the past timings of your time made such a designation and we shall again designate from March 15th the eyes of March to your April 15th, tax day as activity month. Until we next interact with you. We bid you all a fawn and love it. Good night. Until you are not.
