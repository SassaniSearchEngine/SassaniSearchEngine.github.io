 Alright, I'll say, Griefing this evening of your time as you create time to exist. How are you? Perfect. I knew that. Allow me to begin this interaction with the following entitlement. Right now, that is the title. Before we proceed, allow me to express my gratitude for your willingness to co-create this interaction, for only will an action and interaction between us be the result of such a co-creation. Very literally, we are all each other's version of whoever we are. For each and every one of you create reality in its entirety. And although it seems on the surface to be impossible that you all do this and that that statement still be accurate, nevertheless, you are now on the fringes of understanding what you would refer to in your vernacular ad an infinite concept. And infinity allows for all possibilities, not merely one or another. Always will infinity include both. And therefore, from your linear point of view, sometimes infinite concepts will seem as though they are paradoxical or mutually exclusive, but when you get down to understanding yourself as a whole being, you will understand that it is all true and that the ultimate truth, the ultimate truth is by necessity composed of all truths. Leave one out and it's the ultimate truth minus one. And therefore, not ultimately, the truth in the way that you understand these terms in your language. Therefore, all that you perceive is your version of reality, your version of circumstance, your version of any other individual you are perceiving, you are interacting with. Your version is what you create and your version is what you interact with. That infinite creation, now that you are experiencing yourself as being linear, you still maintain a concept which still translates into even in your linear thinking, now. Now, as you sometimes say, is the only time there really is. And though you will create your reality as a seeming succession of now that seem to come one after another, more accurately, it is one eternal now. Your infinite point of view exists right now in its entirety, not becoming anything that it isn't already, but being completely everything right now. Your finite point of view, your finite experience has the advantage of the porthole, if you will, of the understanding of what you call right now. Because even though you do experience yourselves as a seeming progression of now, each now, then you choose to understand this, is complete, contains it all. Another way of looking at this is that right now, you have everything you need to do anything you want, to be any person you want, to experience any reality that you know is true for you. The idea of becoming something that you are not already is an illusion. It is a playing out of what you create as a succession of now's, but ultimately a decision is made right now and that is your experience. Then you will assume in a given now moment that there is something to obtain. There is a goal to reach. There is something to become that you aren't already. This is an aparency and is part of the decision that you make and that decision in and of itself says, I am not this and will become that in a so-called different now. When you do that, you experience the idea of not having what you need right now. But it is only because of your approach, your interpretation and your decision right now. What I am suggesting and what I am reflecting to you in perfect timing in how you have attracted this interaction and how you attract any knowledge, timing and resources that you create in your life is the concept that you already have what you need right now. You already have the knowledge that you need to at least take the appropriate step right now. You already know what you need to know when you need to know it right now. Building that expansive approach into your decision in the moment. Exhuming, becoming the idea that you do already know it, whatever it happens to be, allows you to begin to access your knowledge, access your power right now. Not tomorrow, not one minute from now, but right now. Building to play with the idea that you do contain the answers, that you do contain the power, that you can do the things you say you desire already, allows you to begin to step in accord with your power and so to speak channel your power into the present. You already channel your power into the present, but when you are not specific about your decision about who you are in the present, you introduce an element you generally refer to as randomness as opposed to purposefulness. And therefore simply being willing to entertain the notion that you contain it all, that you know what you need to know, that there is something right now that you can do that will allow you to fully be who you are, allows you again to begin to be conscious in the management and the dispensation of your power, which again I remind you you will use anyway, but we are introducing the idea of purposefulness. For you all seem to say, what is my purpose? Your purpose is completely up to you. An indicator of your purpose is what you refer to as your passion, your excitement from what is available in any given right now moment, something will always stand out as feeling more exciting to do than anything else. And we have discussed many times in many interactions with many members of your society that this vibrational discernment is you reflecting back to yourself in the situation who you are. What alternative is most representative of the you that you know yourself to be? As we have in that sense discussed also each and every now moment right now you make a decision about who you are. That decision can be based upon many criteria. What we have suggested to begin to entertain is the idea of allowing that decision to be according to your preference, according to your desire, and according to your knowing of who you are based on perhaps to play the linear game who you desire to be if you feel that you are not the person you already wish to be. But the idea is that the only thing that prevents you from getting the effect of being a particular person you desire to be and feel perhaps that you are not is a decision right now that you are not that person and then generally plug in and must do this, this, this, and this before you will decide that you are. Ultimately, it always then again boils down to the decision this is who I am. Beginning to ask yourself who am I? Who would I desire to be if I could be anyone? Allows you to begin to clarify, to define, to establish, to discern, to ascertain who you are according to your own criteria. For though individuals will sometimes say in your society, I know you better than you know yourself, this is impossible. Only do you know who you are. Someone can say you are this person and you can then decide, well, they must be right because everyone always tells me so. Ultimately, it is only your agreement, your decision that gives you the effect of being a person who someone else observes you to be. From again, your knowingness, only you know who you are. Anyone else's feedback is simply reinforcement to the understanding of who you are either because their renderings are accurate and allow you to say, yes, that is me or because their observations are not at all who you know yourself to be and allow you to see more clearly who you are in relief to the misidentification that they seem to be observing. Your decision is always made right now. In a sense, whoever you decide that you are right now, you are. And then right now, should you choose to be someone else, you are automatically and across the board. This mechanism is always in place, always has been, always will be. So there is no matter of gaining the spiritual tools and knowledge to be who you are. It is a matter of understanding that you already apply those tools 100%. You always decide something and therefore because you have done this flawlessly your whole entire life and in fact before, you are experts at deciding who you are. The introduction of conscious intention is the fulcrum, is the threshold that allows you to create consciously that transforms any idea or experience of what you hear to for have labeled subconscious, unconscious. The effects that you would seem to get from the subconscious, the unconscious closet, are truly only fancily worded decisions that allow in the statement of the decision itself for randomness, for hiding parts of yourself from yourself, for rationalizing, unprepared behavior. If you simply decide to decide right now, that is all it takes to begin to express yourself consciously, your decision being the product of a conscious understanding immediately transforms any effects that would appear to be subconscious or unconscious. Sometimes we will make the statement that what you refer to as unconscious knowingness is really the same as conscious unknowingness. And what this basically boils down to mean is you still decide not to decide. Therefore then the effects seem to come from another source, but there is no other source. You are the infinite creators of your own reality. So expert are you at creating your reality completely that you can experience the appearance of an external universe. So expert are you at completely expressing yourself in finite terms that it can seem as though you are in a reality, but a minute member, a grain of sand in the infinity of creation. This is the degree as a creator of power that you possess, the ability to completely forget that you even created it all. Again where the advantage of that comes in is that you in choosing to forget who you are so to speak, allow yourself to uncover this cover, to see who you are and that joy of discovery is part of the advantage of linear thinking, of linear experience. However you can still have the joy of discovery. You can still have the experience of expansion without needing to perpetuate the illusion that you are but a sand in infinity. And this is what you are beginning to do. In even attracting yourself to an interaction such as this, not that it is us or we are any better than any other source. But simply that our approach is expanded and completely self-empowering. The mere fact that you attract this tells you this is your timing. This is you unfolding your timing to yourself. And in even calling us or myself another source, I am playing into the illusion for I am truly foundationally, fundamentally, most basically you. And when you see anything you find desirable in anything including our approach, it is simply you reveling at what you already contain. And this is why when interacting with you we do not accept credit. It is like walking up to the mirror and saying to the mirror, you have helped me to be more me. Well, alright, perhaps that is one way to look at it. But ultimately you are the originating brilliance reflected then back to yourself and you are the one then beholding the reflection and marveling. The mirror is also you as well. And therefore we remind you of this because you need not create elaborate process in unusual circumstance although it is a very creative way to go about it as well to reflect back to yourself who you are. Interaction such as this by all means are one way to reflect to yourself but walking down your street and simply beholding something that you find inspiring, interacting with another individual and feeling that individual, breathing the air of your planet, smelling a beautiful flower, all these things are you reflecting back to yourself and are cause for celebration of yourself, of your willingness to express yourself in terms whereby you are able to appreciate who you are and express yourself in these terms. It always occurs right now and right now is your point of power, is your portal of entry if you will, is your center point and because it always exists because it is always right now you are never ever ever ever ever ever ever cut off from yourself or your power unless you decide that that is who you are in that right now moment. And in making such a disempowering decision you are still exercising your power 100%. Therefore as creators, well right you have no off switch you are always on your ability enables you to interpret your reality through this understanding, through the understanding that your power is nothing to obtain, your power is nothing to grow poor, your power is nothing to become your power is who you are. That was a mouthful and so on that note I will give you the pleasure of a short introduction to you. Allow me to simply say our sentiment toward you and toward all beings but you as well is unconditional love and appreciation. This means no matter what, no matter who you decide to be right now we will always love you and appreciate that decision though that decision may completely differ from a decision that perhaps we would make. Now again I do not mention this because it is us and we occupy any place of authority I mention it as an example, as an invitation to treat yourself with that same respect. By being willing to unconditionally love and appreciate yourself which is only a decision by the way you free yourself up to express yourself effortlessly and fully. You replace any former decision that you have made that yourself love must be earned. If you decide yourself love must be earned that is conditional self love and that is not a law or a tendency of the universe that is a decision as well. When you conditionally love yourself if you fall short of who you think you should be you render the judgment. You get the effect. You create the true opposite of unconditional love which is the emotion you refer to as guilt. All you need to do is again take that same ability that same application and simply decide I unconditionally love and appreciate myself. This means no matter what I do or no matter in my explorations which effect I may achieve I am not willing to allow the leeway of the removal of that love. That love is a given that again is a decision that you can make and many of you do, sleeping with. But you can decide right now where you are power lies in each and every moment to simply cut yourself at least that much slack. More unconditionally loving yourself allows you again to express yourself fully and effortlessly and allows you to make decisions which are consistent with the understanding of who you know yourself to be rather than out of guilt and obligation which is someone else's version perhaps of who you should be and your agreement to that particular decision. Therefore entertain the idea that when you unconditionally love yourself you are maximally affected and by convention you then give yourself the framework in which to unconditionally love others as well. And this means you do not need to agree with their approach. You do not need to agree with their decisions but at least you can validate them as a valid set of decisions with a valid set of outcomes which is true for them. And again the ultimate truth is composed of all truths anyway so in invalidating someone else's truth that invalidates yourself. For again your willingness to co-create this interaction with me this evening of your time I again thank you and after you how we may mutually be of service to each other with the sharing. Shitting. First. Okay hi. Greasy. Three questions. Ah three number one. Can you tell me something about intelligence on this planet in terms of brain cells capacity to understand what more gray matter in one person than another. Can you give me any clarity about. Simply it is my perspective that the body exists within the consciousness and not the other way around. So therefore the body the physical cells of the body what you refer to down to your DNA structure is a reflection. When you decide when you buy into the idea that consciousness and intelligence are a result of the body your decisions automatically reflect that idea and seem to support the experience of consciousness being a result of the brain. However again that is only a decision. My understanding and my particular viewpoint realize is that if a person shifts their consciousness their physical body will shift individuals do not have much of as you say a problem believing that but so will their physical structure your physical brain your physical cells and if indeed that is what it will take to reflect your expanded form of consciousness what you refer to as your DNA will shift as well. So it is not my perspective that intelligence is the result of gray matter but that gray matter is the result of consciousness. Also your scientists seem to insist based on what you call the readings of your various instruments that you only use what you call a percentage or portion of your brain that is not our perception. Our perception is that you are a 100% being who uses exactly the correct amount to correspond with whatever you are being at any given moment and some of the so-called usage is simply not measurable with your current technology. So that was my son's are involved in standardized testing for getting into college and there is so much competition and so much emphasis placed on the standardized test score as a measure of intelligence that it just brings up the whole idea of the man the concept of limit these children when they get the standardized test results that oh I must sit in his category because the test shows me I'm only this or I'm really smart because it shows me I got this score. Well but if an individual is concentrating on the structure and what you call the competitive nature of the structure then their emphasis is not simply expressing the most them that they can and paradoxically were they to enter these situations with the understanding that this is an opportunity to express their knowledge express their consciousness that would in that sense remove the so-called pressure that individuals put on and they would even get what you call better results. Thank you. Oh I have done nothing. Number two. Well I picked the dream one. I am going to wake up in the morning sometimes feeling like I played out the stress of my belief system at night and wake up having had dreams that show me my belief system like I believe I'm responsible for killing people on some level so I dream that the fact that did kill someone and I wake up with that sense of incredible stress even though I thought I went to sleep in a very peaceful loving place. Oh right do you find this to be of service or as you say obnoxious. Well both. Both are true true is obnoxious and so you do to some degree judge it. No let me just say I wake up physiologically being affected by what I dreamt so I guess the judgment comes in that well I don't feel really good because I feel really stressed out from whatever I dreamt last. May I ask you a question when you wake up so to speak from my perspective you are dreaming right now but we won't get into that. Do you find that the so called actions that you had performed are not representative of who you are when you wake. The actions are not representative of my actions but they do feel really comfortable in terms of my deep down belief system. Oh right but the idea that I am asking what I am inquiring is when you wake up do you say well I am a murderer or do you say that is not truly who I see as myself. Funny I guess I wake up saying she that's really who I see myself be. I know what you're saying. I can wake up and say that's not who I am but I haven't done it yet. The point is either way it serves you. If you understand that is not who you are it puts you in touch with that idea. If you allow it to be okay to have such an experience understanding that it is an exploration that allows you to see in relief who you are by again perhaps providing examples of who you are not and you allow that to be okay. Not that you would do such a thing physically but that you do not judge yourself for having done it. That is when you will find that type of what you call experience to seem to see. And it is truly the judging I should not be doing that or I am invalidating where that may be accurate for me that seems to perpetuate the effect instead of allowing it to simply transform and play out. Kind of like a window into what my belief system was or is. So it's giving me an opportunity to learn or experience. There are many ways to approach this but for the purposes of this particular discussion it allows you to play out a certain notion within yourself without what you would refer to as your waking repercussions. Therefore you allow yourself to have the experience but then you allow yourself to wake again into this dream and not having the repercussions of that experience still get to have as you say your cake and eat it through. And generally when you come to terms with that being alright again not that the act itself is an integrated act or not that that is something it is my perception not meaning to be presumptuous that though you may contain the idea of such anger contain the idea of such a drastic action that it truly is not representative of who you know yourself to be as a being. Now again do not mean to be presumptuous but it is my sensing that my statement is accurate. It's not that I'm killing someone intentionally it's an accident something I've caused that causes them to die. But again I remind you as well to say these are beliefs that I contain that I am not perhaps playing out is really quite an arbitrary statement in and of itself. The reason being because you contain all beliefs and their opposite. And it is not practical it is not your approach as an individual as a linear being to play every single one out but you do contain them all. Therefore having an experience in what you call your sleeping dream need not be interpreted to say well I am deep down this miserable person who would do such a thing and be so negligent as it allows you to see that you contain all beliefs and are very consciously aware of the ones that you will choose to manifest in your waking dream. Does this make sense? Is this of assistance? Number three. Number three really is for my son it has to do with electromagnetism and he's taking the physics and can't quite understand why positive flows into negative and I said well you just have to accept this in this earth maybe in another dimension it doesn't. Do you know what I'm saying? It is simply a description of a tendency of flow of energy in your linear reality. Yes it is accurate to say that all physical and non-physical realities have different sets of rules some of which are quite similar to your own and some of which in that sense are quite different and sometimes opposite from your own but the idea is it is a tendency in your reality. Now I say a tendency as opposed to a law because there are exceptions to this but again there is no need to get into that. So it could be different in another party universe. Even in your own but it is perhaps you can say the general tendency and therefore will tend to be what is observed but remember the observation the observer and the observed are really all the same being you. Like we discover in the future that in fact that is not the only law? Absolutely. And again even calling it a law it is truly more accurately simply a local phenomenon. I thank you. Thank you. Shut it. Ice. Male. We have related questions. Ah another set of free. This time unrelated. Of course they are related. We all know that. Well right. Perhaps they are completely irrelevant. We shall see. How soon will the known oil reserves on planet earth run out assuming the current rate of consumption? Not within what you call your foreseeable future. And it is our particular, shall I say, prediction understanding that a prediction is simply the sensing of the energy available in the present as what is most likely should nothing change. Before such a thing would happen by many many many years you will begin to rely on different forms of energy. That is as specific as I choose to be. It doesn't have to run out in order to cause other viable forms to be more competitive than oil. It is not likely though there can be the fear of this that would drive such alternative sources. Okay let me switch to crop circles. Can you give us an update? It's been a long time that anything has been said about crops circles. Are they still continuing with a increase? Is the message changing? What's happening? They do continue. There is a preponderance of what you refer to in your vernacular as hoaxes which are generally human made ideas. The idea of the communications is that they are similar. They are print ideas that do not necessarily have one particular interpretation. And if approached intuitively can mean different things for different individuals and everyone is accurate for they need to get for who they are. Are the SSONI still making triangular crops circles? Not so much. From time to time. Not recently. How about the US? Are we getting any? We never read the media is so secretive about this. Basically your answer is encrypted in the question. They do exist. There is not much publicity about them. There are not what you would refer to as many. But there are a few. One last question. Number three. Unrelated questions. Proceed. As one being on this planet, one of nearly six billion, I keep hearing the idea that one person can have a real impact on, let's say, the mass consciousness of this entire planet. And from an engineering standpoint, what on a six billion? How can that be? Ah! Very interesting question. In understanding that we know each other and that you have been privy to our point of view many times. Would you care to answer that? Well, one thing I think of is the 100th monkey phenomenon. I don't think that really applies to what I just said. Perhaps your question is asked from the standpoint of the grain of sand in the infinity universe that we had mentioned in the introduction to this interaction. Assuming yourself as simply one minute being rather than creation itself. Now when you do that, you make a decision. And your decision sticks. And from the result and standpoint of seeing yourself in microcosmic terms existing within a reality, your question has meaning and validity. But understanding yourself as the creator, understanding yourself as pure consciousness. You are the only one there is. And so therefore, only can any approach that you have make a difference across the board. More locally as we have shared many times, when you shift your point of view, when you shift your decision, others seem to change. You did not go out and personally canvas each and every individual. And yet you are seeing the reflection of the change of yourself. The change of the expression of who you are. And so therefore, changing yourself changes it all. And that is the most accurate answer I can give. I wish to argue with me by only two. I can see impact of being who I am, moment to moment. And the results encouraging that that has. For example, three people here tonight coming from quite a distance are here in a sense because of some things I've done are exposed them to. Well in a sense. You are real good about that. Oh why? And the people I associate with day to day, I feel I'm having a beneficial impact on them. Oh are you satisfied with the few numbers involved? I'd like to see bigger numbers. Oh. Then expand your definition. And understand when you change your approach and decision, everything changes. And you need not corral many monkeys. So you understand conceptually what I am saying. I guess being a double Leo I'd like to get on stage and talk to a lot of people about the things I believe. Well by all means do. Rather than just one other time. But this happens anyway. And again saying only one of six billion is a very specific decision. Yes. Yeah that's minimal. And with that particular decision, the resulting sentiment can be overwhelmed. I can't possibly make an impact. But the idea is your impact is automatic. And again you are not responsible for the other six billion. And only are you responsible for yourself. When you fully be responsible for yourself, then you are being responsible to the rest. And that is what makes the impact. Whether they are specifically aware of you as an individual or not. For a change in anything is a change in everything. Again the analogy we have made is it is again all in your point of view. We have used the analogy of a cube with perhaps all the same colored side. If you change the color of one side, you then have the choice of seeing that it is the same old cube with a slight facelift or it is a completely different cube. And that particular slight shift in your approach gives a completely different effect. One same old cube big deal. The other joyous new cube to explore. I always said that the most effective teacher we can be is our own example. And my effort is to be the best me, I am smart enough to be given my spiritual belief system. So I will just keep doing that. Oh right. No effort involved to be who you are. The effort comes in where the resistance comes in, where the friction comes in, is in resisting who you are. So no need to try. I think joy, no pain. So I guess that is consistent with what you said. Oh right. Perhaps again no pain and pain are very similar. Simply say I am well rather than I am not in pain. And you will be emphasizing wellness rather than de-emphasizing pain which is the same thing as still focusing on pain. Thank you very much. Oh thank you. You have done it all. Shutting. Give it up. Yes. I am so excited to be here. I just love this reflection that I am getting in you so much. Absolutely and totally. And I have two questions and a half. Oh whatever. I will be redirected to see that. Oh right. Proceed. It is your mirror. Thank you. Okay. The first question, there is a root that is grown in Africa and it is pronounced either Ibogene or Ibogene. And I have been invited to live in Costa Rica where this root is now going to be transplanted. But Mr. Fuller has donated a thousand acres of land there because they are finding that this root supposedly has something called an interrupt or two addiction where it reconnects synapses in your brain that have not been functioning due to addictions. And I am a facilitator to have this happen. And I want to find out if you have ever heard of this root from Africa and if it does indeed have these properties before I go there. To answer your question most directly, I am aware of what you are seeking up and it can function to facilitate in that capacity. Ultimately, again, I remind you that everything stems from consciousness. And so when you create the need so to speak, the tool may be forthcoming. All of this feels. Therefore, what I am saying is that it is a tool and if you understand that it is a tool, you are using it more responsibly to realize that although it may appear that the tool achieves the effect, it is the individual that achieves the effect. But it is a very strong tool and one of several that will be emerging and already are emerging. Great, fantastic. Mago on? Number two, still looking for that past question. Okay. I have developed a concept over the years called Pazanem that is getting some recognition and the question I have is, and it is totally in sync with everything that I have heard from you in the past couple of years, and this concept Pazanem is what? Which as Atonem's homonyms, they are words whose root reflect what you choose in this life, what you are choosing as your preference in life. Oh, it is. I think. It is wonderful, yes. Very creative, positively aligning ideas. Thank you. With a catchy little phrase. Thank you. Thank you. So, the question was, if you had any suggestions on how to further expand the Pazanem idea which has now been led into question two and a half of Pazimaj, which is creating images that reflect the positive decision and preferences in your life. Or what may I quote liberally from your slang? Yes. Go for it. Okay. Thank you. In a sense, I appreciate the idea of sharing this with me, but this is nothing you are not aware of. Simply do it. Thank you. For willingness to expose these types of positively aligned languages to your society will be, as you say, very well received and timely. This is not a prediction. It's simply a sense. Thank you so much. I have done nothing. Thank yourself. Thank yourself on the back. And I would call that a full question. Okay. Sneaky. Sharing. Good evening. Greetings to you as always. Thank you. To answer Steecel's question, I think that last sharing was a perfect example of somebody being who they are and expressing that and taking action in the world. And I know I contain that now because I just shared that with her. And I think that is what will change this world. Is everybody being who they are? Oh, what? When will it? By the way. Right. Oh. Right here. Do you really mean it or do you just say what you think I want to hear? Ah, hesitation. I will consider that that I caught you. But the point is it is that simple and simply being mindful of the wording. Simply take the word become and remove the come. B-I-M. Fill in the bike. The world is already transformed. It allows you to be in the particular frame of mind, mindset, to now look for the evidence, to now see the changes, emphasize the transformation as having already been registered rather than constantly dangling the transformational carrot out in front of you. And it is that simple. The only thing that delivers the appearances that you are still transforming is that language, is working into the decision any slight connotation of futureing will be becoming, wanting to be, growing into and so forth. And therefore, if you wish to begin right now to behold your world as transformed, which may still contain remnants of ideas which are, as you sometimes say, falling into alignment, simply have your decision be that definite. My reality is transformed and then begin to see through the eyes of that result, that decision and the evidence is all around you already. Are you still there? I understand that. I understand that. I'm breathing that in. It moves me a lot. A refreshing breath. Right now I'm definitely deciding not to experience any negativity because I do live on a linear timeline. Oh, right. Again. You brought it up. You are deciding not to experience any negativity. Remove the not and the focus is still on negativity. Perhaps a positive would be appropriate here. I am deciding to experience a positive world. Oh, what? Are you being or are you deciding? I am a positive reality. I throw that out simply as an old courtesy. I am. Period. I am period. Very proton. As always accurate. Can I ask you? I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. Can I ask you? I like to ask questions about her theme. Go right ahead. Okay, I left her magnetic shifts. I choose. There's all my questions off. Actually, I probably answered all my questions. No, I don't know. But we're happy at the time now. Alright. Yeah, we are. I see. I'm still emphasizing a bit on the idea of external turmoil. I understand this idea of electromagnetic shifts in our consciousness. Okay, collectively and individually. Oh, what? What I'm saying? I believe the earth is part of all of us. I am the earth. Okay. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Thank you. And as I change, the earth changes vice versa. Correct? Literally, yes. Okay. As you change your entire reality, reflect that change. And cutting your planets some slack is a nice touch. Individuals generally sell short the ability of the consciousness of your planet. Again assuming humankind to not be nature. I intend to become here today. I have these questions about some literal things which I never do. And if you're enough, it's not happening. We are getting back to the basics of who I am. And it's really interesting to me. Would you like me to have a disempowered discussion with you? It's not my style, but I assume since I know what I need to know when I need to know it, I could probably play a role. Well, there's a lot of symbols in my life, in the world that I'm attracted to. And I would, I wanted them more about them. And I understand that they are vehicles towards me enjoying my life more fully. Wow, that's coming out right here. He's coming out perfectly and allowing you to examine your approach. For only when you align your approach positively, will you get the immediate effects you say you desire. And by seeing where your approach is playing out, which by the way you do not need to do, but by seeing that you can align, realign with your positive self. So this is all of service, not only to yourself, but to everyone who has attracted you. Absolutely. But all your questions are valid. And never will I invalidate them in any way, simply point out that when you language things from your power, many of these questions are simply easily answered by yourself. All right. I'd like to ask one question, please. Oh, what? It's about one of the symbols. And one of the symbols is this blue crystal skull we spoke of. I want that to exist within me, because I believe it does. And I have decided to discover it or rediscover it. What moment? I want to find it. Does it exist within you or do you want it to exist within you? It exists within you. Oh, then it does. All right. There was no question, no uncertainty. It does. Unless you change your mind. No, I believe that it does. Oh, I'm very excited about the idea that this sense of discovery through this tool that I have attracted that excites me very much. And I want to find out maybe what more I can do through whether meditation or visualization that I can enhance this more to find this within myself. Oh, and may I ask you a question? Thank you. Were you to find the blue crystal skull and hold it in your hand in front of your face or are you picturing it? Oh, pause the match. Who are you now while doing that? What has that allowed you to become? What has that allowed you to express having it right there? Are you still playing along? Oh, I am. And I can answer that question. I'm looking into something that's very beautiful. The eyes are my eyes. I see my face within the reflection. Literally, I do. What is that now allowing you to be that you have not been here to for? See my beauty. Ah. How does that feel? Very moving, very beautiful. Then you have discovered the blue crystal skull. Let us assume for one moment that you climb mountains, traverse canyons, descend into valley, dig and shovel and pick and find the crystal skull and hold it up and then feel the way you have described. Is it all that activity that resulted in you feeling that way or the decision that you made when you picked it up and looked at it that resulted in you feeling that way? The journey there. Oh, I have a nice trip. But the point that I am making is ultimately it is the decision. I can now be this. And by simply imagining what that will be and then feeling what it is, you can make that decision now be that person now using the inspiration of the symbol now and then if there need be, if it would behoove you to physically attract the corresponding symbol, it simply will effortlessly happen. It will find you. If it is truly the thrill of the climbing, traversing and descending, then do that as well. So what is its purpose, the blue crystal skull? You have just told me. And that. Seeing the beauty within yourself that never for one moment was absent. Only perhaps your willingness to express your unconditional self appreciation. With this program into the skull. From me. Perhaps again you will understand that any program is what you would refer to as individually variable in that any such symbol will trigger or key what any individual chooses to reflect back to themselves and therefore the program is holographic, not specific. Different individuals will simply derive what will behoove them from the symbol. So for you, yes, that is the program so to speak. But you are the programmer. And when this skull was fashioned briefly, that was its intention. To play along with what you are saying, one of the intentions, the one that is specific to you. For now, unless you should find some other idea that it inspires within you, then you may understand that to have been part of its programming as well. Now, I am finding out if I am part of that fashioning of this thing, then that was my intention for myself then, correct? Because I believe that to be so. That was your initial unlocking trigger. Not necessarily all of it. The first recognition. Understood. Understood. Thank you. Thank you. At this timing, we will pause for a short break of 10 to 15 of your minutes of counting. And resume contact at that timing.
