 Oh, I don't say continue. Shitting. For sure. Hey. Hi, how are you? Have you? Good day. I am perfect. Last time I was with you, I shared about a UFO experience and you assisted me with some information. It was a Canadian device that I was at correctly. I had a visit on my birthday, which was able to find the audience. Oh, how are you? What a presence. And what? I was a little fearful when I first went through a good time that we were in fear. What happened? Transformed it, but we understand. Thank you. What happened was I was at a low lake house on Channelwood Lake at West District's house and I went to sleep after having a very open conversation with my sister and brother about the information you had shared with me. And it was well received on their part, so it was a very open conversation. And I went to sleep and I realized that I wasn't in my bed anymore. I felt like I was still reclined, but I was in that vehicle that was kind of pointed. And there was a lot of people around it, but I can't really get a sense of their faces, but I felt their feet. Oh, they love them for them. But they were in white. I guess my first question is, were they inflating? In respect, that you mean? Yes. Can you describe their physicality, height? They were short. They were all the same height and they were short. I guess, when I said short, well, they seemed to be, they could find us lying down there and they were only maybe three feet above me from what would appear to be the way it stopped. What happened was, whatever I was in, whatever being closed, I was starting to move really fast forward and stop and then go back really fast and just going back and forth and I was getting motion sick. And I was very upset about it, so I started yelling to stop that I had enough. And once I yelled stop, stop I had enough. I think I only yelled at once if I remember. And it stopped and I was sitting up and my sister's doorman was sleeping in the same room with me. I was sitting up and shaking and staring at me and there was a fullness and my room was pretty well lit that night. That was it. We do sense in this instance that there are other influences, but the client in that sense do label them. How do the interaction allow you to feel understanding that it is an acclimating experience? Well, I felt upset about it at first. Not only when it happened, but I didn't like the motion shield and I didn't understand why they were choosing to communicate with me in that way. What I got to look at. What was your perception of the communications? I'm not clear about that. All right, when you say that you are a bit disappointed they chose to communicate with you that way, what was the communication? Or did you hear me? That you are a bit disappointed that they took you for a ride. Many individuals in your society desire such a ride. Then we next time you may choose if you wish we will not force you to have too much fun, but relax a bit and begin to take in the experience you are participating with. When you create fear, you put up a wall not allowing the full receptivity. The ends are still next. The purposes are still served, but in that sense again, it is an acclimating experience for you, enabling you to see what your remaining level of fear is and then begin to look at why you would even fear it. The, shall we say, queasiness, feeling of uneasiness in general is from the fear itself but the judging of the fear. Do you understand? Yes. All right. Do not need to judge it. Simply, if you are going to fear, then go right ahead. Fear and then allow yourself to ask what you must believe to be feared. Now we detect that it is slightly, lightly, shall we say that perhaps it crossed your mind that these were not well-meaning beings. Does this sound? Yes. Do understand. You are well-meaning beings. You vibrate in love and light with positivity and therefore will only draw such beings, but by the very nature of the interaction, they are alien to you. You are alien to them. And therefore it may seem in that sense that there is a bit of an unusualness about the interaction, but in no way does it need be interpreted negatively. Therefore, if you will be now willing to invite such an interaction and allow yourself to become more aware of your part in the co-creation, it will go the next step. I want to add one more thing. I was here tonight. I got in touch with the thought that I think I have become so attached to you and your way of communicating to me that I created a block because I want other experiences to be more like the way I experience it. But understand by very definition, they are a different civilization, no less, audited, but will have different nuances, different strengths, different, shall we say, things about them that apply directly to you. Understand the joy that you feel in the interactions between us does not come from me. It comes from you. You only can create what you contain. Every ever does create any other effect other than what you create and assign that effect externally. So the idea is many individuals will say, well, but I feel your energy. And that is not precisely behind you. The idea is you are feeling your energy and creating it only because you already contain it. You can bring the fact that you do contain it into those interactions and in a sense deal with those beings more on the level you perceive us to be communicating on from your end. Do you understand? This will enable in a sense them the open door, the opportunity to deal with you on that different level. We are in communication with that society, but again, the little men in white were a little bit different from what we had labeled pre-adience. And we were not initially clear to promise, but we will not elaborate for another label is not necessarily at this time for your discovery. Shall we say for the purposes of discussion, they were very literally middle-left. Middle-left? Yes. Don't mean to be mysterious, but simply we will allow you to open your own gifts. I mean, thank you. Thank you. Sure. Yes. My concern is are they to be rather being, are they out there from the start? From our perspective, no. Fear. In general, the ones you would label negative never make it this far. It takes a certain amount of cohesiveness in a society in order to develop the expanded consciousness which then has the corresponding physiological symbol of being able to expand physiologically. Individuals or societies that engage in negativity don't in that sense create that corresponding symbol for they buy perpetuating negativity, limitation, self-care. Separation. Do not open themselves up to the totality of their beings. Do you understand that very often individuals who impose themselves on others, or shall we say almost always, do so from an inner feeling of helplessness and thereby need to force themselves upon others because they do not feel they are sufficiently strong to be able to interact without the forcing. And this, in and of itself, to take self-limiting mechanism to a society in order to establish shall we say the type of technology to get them this far. So those that are in contact with your civilization from your perspective, you would label benevolent. There are individuals upon your planet, however, who shall we say very heavily buy into the negative alien scenario and for them they create a different reality altogether. And are of the vibration to attract such a reality whereby you are not. Does that make sense? Oh, right. You do not sound satisfied. No, I'm thinking, well, what do they want to learn? Which way do you mean the positive beings? Simply, that many more ways that all that is, which is our name for God, expresses itself in the multiverse, for we revel at every expression, every type of expression of creation to us is a miracle. Very loving. Very loving. Very willing to share and at the same time not at all willing to impose themselves upon you. This is why we remain, colloquially speaking, in the background where we to land now. We are not perceived in that way as equals your society or shall we say portions of it feel the need to be saved. That is not our function. That would not be a loving way in that sense to treat your society. We recognize your self-empowerment. We await an invitation and will not come down in that sense till one is issued. That the criteria by which your planet will establish itself in global unity will be by viewing us as your equals. For even though we may be a bit more expanded in consciousness, we do not view you as any less than us. We view you as an exact equal. When you are willing to view us as your equal, then we can interact face to face. This is happening with individuals in your society but so far not a mass. Does this more answer the question or do you have another question? No, I understand but for myself it's just like a sphere. Well again, fear is believing that a reality you do not prefer is most likely. Now that you have that definition of fear, begin to ask yourself when you fear why would I believe in this reality I do not prefer. Why would I believe that any reality I do not prefer is most eminent? It may very well be that you do not believe that you create your own reality. But understand in order to change your belief to that you do, you must first own the belief that you do not. You cannot change what you do not own. So when you will be willing to own, alright, alright, alright, I do not believe I create my own reality 100%, you are now back in the driver's seat. You are now back in the position to be able to change it. But again by denying what you already believe you will never change it. So embrace your fear. Understand as we have said, all things are neutral props. This also applies to emotions. In your society when you usually feel fear, it is ingrained within you to immediately say, oh that is very bad. But you do not have to. You can say here is a neutral emotion that I have formally labeled negative. When I have labeled it negative, I have never gotten anything but a negative effect. I will be a bit more creative this time and label it positive. Everything will begin to find how it serves you, when you allow any symbol to serve the purpose it is created for, it transforms. You cannot get rid of fear. There is no where to get rid of anything to. You are the entire universe. Where will you put it? But you can transform it by allowing some aspect of it to serve you. Not focusing in on what is most obviously negative, but being a bit more creative and beginning to now look at what must be positive. And every single time you will do this, you will find something positive. And it will be something that does serve you. That will allow you to not get rid of your fear, but use it, embrace it and allow it to transform to ecstasy. Is that a service? Yes. All right. Share. Good morning. Good morning. I think you said that everything is always right. Like there is no wrong. In a sense what we mean is there are no accidents everything has its place. We do not use the words right and wrong, but they are very arbitrary. All right. Well then why in our society and our world are we like taught right from wrong? Thank you very much. Good morning. In general, this is done for there is a perception in some of the mass consciousness that the rules must be weighed down so that the society doesn't go crazy. However, understand that the things that people label right and wrong are very arbitrary. We prefer to use the terminology again, negative and positive. Positive meaning integrated. Realizing that everything is all part of the same thing and acting that way. Negative meaning separated. Denying that everything is all a part of you and treating it as though it was foreign. So your society has again creatively laid down certain rules, but they are again very arbitrary. Sometimes things which are separative are labeled right, which are in that sense integrative are labeled wrong. So right and wrong do not so much apply. However, again, by simply using your common sense, you can see if everyone is your brother and sister how you would treat them if you really believe that and that would not mean killing them, would not mean lying to them for you would not lie to yourself and everything is part and parcel of yourself. Is this answering? Yes. What are you showing? Oh my. Do you have another question? No. Shane. Sure. Yes. Yesterday my daughter-in-law gave birth to my first grandson. Congratulations. Thank you. I take full credit. I have two or three questions. First, tell me everything you're willing to tell me about that being my grandson and why did he choose my son and daughter-in-law as his parents? All right, again, these questions are a bit arbitrary and applied more to the discovery of those individuals. So therefore, we will say no comment and a lot of you, another question. Okay. You did not disappoint me. To what extent? Nor you. Yeah. The feeling is beautiful. To what extent do the genes and chromosomes? He got from my son and daughter-in-law going to affect his future and behavior. In the sense that they are the ones that are most conducive, coincidentally, to allow him to fully explore the reality he is choosing to create. Good answer. Thank you. We thought so. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I think that being that the earth is an entity in its own right, would it be possible for you to perhaps dial in locks so that we could have a word? Possible? Yes. Yes. Will we do it? Not the same. It is something that will, in that sense, be possible, go through other individuals. What may we add? The parallel multiple earths of which you speak are, shall we say, the physicalized expressions of the various earths, recognizing all tied back to one over soul earth, however, one higher self earth, however. And we felt it would make that distinction. Do you understand? Very well. And I hope I give very much to them. Thank you. I have two questions. One is related to my own health. And just be interested in your thoughts. I have in our terms of this society, three chronic illnesses. Oh, right. And I struggle between accepting them, seeing them as learning experiences. Most of the time, it's real hard to think it's all wonderful in how much I'm growing and learning. And I'm just wondering, and other times I felt tremendously guilty because all this co-creation, you know, that I made this all happen and this all my thoughts. Oh, you don't have to feel guilty and understand that guilt from our perspective is the opposite of love, not hate. For guilt is a total lack of self love in the moment that you are creating it. Hate while a polarized expression of love still implies some deserved ability. So therefore, when you feel guilty, examine that you do indeed deserve to exist. And we all that is, say so, or you wouldn't think it is. However, can you define the three chronic diseases? Sure. One is I'm an alcoholic. Oh. Second is I'm a bulimic and the third is I'm a depressive who has to take medication in order to function. Oh. Then we ask you a simple question which you may have not been asked before. We understand what has been negative in your reality about these things. For a moment sway your perspective. And using your imagination, tell us now, what have those things actually allowed you to do that you would not have done otherwise? Oh, shit. Oh, right. That's one. Well, the truth is they forced me or allowed me to discover, to look at things in a way that I never would have if I didn't have them. Which is about surrender and acceptance and higher power. Oh, right. And that is one way to do go on. They've given me great compassion for other people who suffer from similar kinds of things. And they've given you an ability to communicate to those individuals. Yes, ma'am. Oh. What else? Um, I don't know. Let's see. Well, what's the question I already forgot? What is it that this has allowed you to do? Again, we understand what it has not allowed you. We are now viewing the opposite to our reality. How it has served you. And you have come up with quite a few things. Now understand that all these things are simply symbols, physiological representations of ideas from consciousness. Therefore, if you will take these things that the this is has allowed you to do and now begin to do them first, you will not need to continue to create a symbol to force yourself to do it. This is all that this ease is anyway. You not getting the messages you are giving yourself to the point where you create a seeming forcing it upon yourself from yourself. Now do understand you have created it, but you do not need to feel guilt about having done so if you will glean the positive from it. Now again, the things you have named can now be done without having to continue the disease. Is that not correct? Therefore, begin to do them and the disease symbol will have outlived its usefulness. You can, if you are understanding what I am saying, right now be cured of all these ideas. If you will simply now go on and act as though a person who no longer deserves them, no longer has a need for them. One other idea, when you begin to feel guilt, self-judgment, look at that. Why are you judging yourself? And another shall we say, particularly popular notion upon your planet is when you begin to explore higher consciousness and understand that judgment is separation. When you find yourself judging, judging, you are judging. This compounds the situation. So therefore begin to allow when you find yourself having these feelings, emotions, to glean meaning from them. Emotions are always a response to a belief system. They are never inherently just there, I simply feel that way, billion now. They are always a response to a belief. So you can always by using the emotion trace back to the belief and then change it. Are you willing to do this? Then you are right in this moment, cured. Can you feel that? No, not one. A little bit of the smell of it. Where will you feel it? And what is scary about being cured? That the end of that. Yeah. Very interesting. Do you understand? Mm-hmm. It is all within your grasp. Mm-hmm. You may take it back at any time. You may, if you are comfortable doing so, continue to create those symbols. All right, now in this moment they are gone. And it is your choice to either recreate them or recreate yourself in a room. Oh, man. Okay. Well, thank you very much. For your open share. Thank you. Share it. For sure. You, the new. Have you developed the ability to be several places at once for involvement? Not in the way that you knew that would far more be an expression of our next density of consciousness, which is non-physical. We can, however, in a sense relocate ourselves very quickly using our technology. Our spacecraft do not fly from point A to point B. They relocate from point A to point B, utilizing vibration. Is it possible to transport the body from one knowing that everything is possible? Okay. This is the realization of developing the ability to transport the physicality from one location to another. The ability, yes, is, however, not that useful or necessary within our chosen explanation, which is still to some degree to experience physicality. You, however, can do is also, and it is simply a matter again of unlocking the firmly held beliefs which keep you from doing so. And it's actually far more natural a state of being to be able to do so. For you do not exist within space and time. Space and time are a property of you. Is there a value in being somewhere else and being where you are simultaneously? Well from all perspective there is a value in all creation. You would have to answer that question from your own perspective. Again recognize you right now exist simultaneously on every level and have chosen to not be aware of these other levels so that you could focus and concentrate on this reality. You can in your meditative state, however, through your imagination make such a trip. You will begin to think that you can unlock the belief that it is impossible to do so. You can teleport and the methodology is quite simple. You close your eyes and get into your meditative state. Picture round and about your physical life body, a gray mistiness. This will be representational of what we use around and about our spacecraft called an isolation field. Then simply by picturing your destination that locks in the coordinates. The mechanism for making the actual, shall we say, teleportation is emotion which is energy motion. So how you would in that sense activated is to draw up with every fiber of your being how that place allows you to feel. And by visualizing it after having created the isolation field and pumping it with the emotion of how that place allows you to feel, you can do it. It is that simple. And anything which makes it more complicated is your opportunity to look at the beliefs you are imposing upon yourself, do not be able to do so. Do you understand? Yes. All right. Final question? All right. What was it? Do you have knowledge that it was your craft that were in the sight of the car that was traveling into Kansas? Describe. I was back in 1970. And there was a cloud. All right. Off to the side. Yes, it was our craft. Okay. And it resolved it to adultish aircraft. In a sense that was always a shame. And it resolved or shall we say left very quickly? Was there any purpose to the experience or was it one moment? Is there any purpose? Any purpose? Any purpose? There is purpose to everything. Shall we say it was you being tapped in the subconscious family to allow you to become conscious of certain agreements that you have made in terms of beginning to point yourself for certain research. And what was your purpose? We have just said. Our purpose was in that sense to be in such a place at that time to allow you that recognition. Oh, one moment. I understand. We will simply exploring the area. Have a good trip. Shiloh. Oh, for sure. I was just having a thought about death and death concerning the humans on this planet. It is usually a fearful thing. Oh, can be. Yeah. That is because many individuals perceive it as an end, which it is not. Once you recognize that it is not an end, it simply becomes shall we say an exciting notion which if you interpret negatively may seem a bit like anxiety. But you go on. The reason why most people feel fearful about it is because it's an unknown thing as you just said, people don't know for sure what it is. But also death has we see it as tragic because the way that people die happens in very tragic ways. I mean, I know that there's something after this life that we have. But the way in which we die is the fearful part. All right. But do recognize that again, as we have said, fear is believing that a scenario is not you, you do not prefer is most likely. And in that sense, it's the same as saying you believe it will happen. This is how individuals attract themselves. So shall we say unpreparential passages. It is not necessarily that that is part of your society. The in that way, all that you will walk down that you will die. Everyone always has. So will you. However, the way you walk through that hall is also up to you. And you do not need to die tragically, as you all say. I was just thinking. I just kind of wish that there's a way that we could just go to a certain place and kind of be transcended instead of, I know it sounds stupid. It does not sound stupid at all. And it is very possible. This is how we and our society when being consciously done with our purpose in a given life, transform, simply, consciously. This is available to you. Simply live your life to the fullest, do what excites you in any given moment so that you are a living reflection of what it is that you chose to be. And when your time has come, you will know you will be one with that transformation. And it will not be for you. Tragic. If you will live your life most fully, then this will play itself out. If individuals are constantly squelching who they are and living in fear of death, that is what creates the tragedy scenarios. You can in that sense, when having lived a full life, have a conscious sense of when it is time to go, simply lay down, say, I am ready, and if you are, you will transform. If you are not, that is your indication. There is still more to do. One moment. Does that make sense? Yeah. All right. Is that another question? I understand fully and exactly what you are saying. All right. But from your tell me, it sounds a bit too good to be true. Yeah. All right. Do you understand that as a belief? Why would something, why would anything be too good to be true? If you deserve all that you desire, if you deserve all the ecstasy you can imagine, then for it is a deserved ability issue. Do you understand? You do deserve to exist. Again, you are created unconditionally. That means you have unconditional deserved ability. It is simply that it is ingrained in you and your society that you do not. That leads individuals to lead these lives. But recognize there is no more weight behind the fact that you do not deserve than that you do. And if you will begin to now consciously buy into that you do deserve it, you will get the evidence to support in your reality that you do deserve it. When you then feel that way as well, you will feel that you deserve, shall we say, a peaceful death and create that? Are you willing to look at that? Go right ahead. Does that help? Yeah. Can we ask any answer anymore? No. Thank you very much over there. Sure. If you do transform, what happens to your body? Oh, thank you very much. You would label it in your society, rapid decay. Rapid. Essentially, we know it is time. Lie down, sit down, whatever is most comfortable and desirable. Just form and then the physiological symbol, having lived out its usefulness, seems to rapidly decay. Right here and then? Very quickly. Not as shall we say in the lingering fashion of your society, which is the symbol indicative of your consciousness grabbing and clinging onto your body. What do they do with your re-name? Well in that sense it is, all right, ashes to ashes, dust to dust. And for us as well. And I said, this should have been true. Could you send your image to my mind so I could see what you look like? And I told several people, I told five people, I told five people, I told five people, I told them, you know, I told them, I told them, I told them, I told them, I told them, I told them that this is something that you put up rather than entirely specific. It is not, it is thought you were going to be all these things, it is not, it's about my monumental record. It is cos We have mass masslessness here of watching us reject ourselves into our minds who would if it's alright. Oh, all right. Is this desirable? Yes. All right. Then do understand one thing. The only hesitation we have in providing an image is we do view you as our equals. This means we do not view us as being above you, you as being above us. In your society, you have a tendency to grab onto the image and toss the message out the window. Therefore, we refrain from, shall we say, sending you over all its shots because we do not want them up on any version of a pedestal. So therefore, this will simply be within your consciousness a sharing idea, and we ask that in no way, shape, or form, do you place it above you. By definition, there is no such thing. You are equal to all creation. Therefore, close your eyes. Allow yourselves to take three deep and loving breaths. Allow the screen of the old imagination, the screen of your consciousness, to become clear and homogenous or smooth. Allow whatever color presents itself to be, the background of that screen, whether it be red, whether it be gray, whether it be black, does not matter. Now, understand, before we, colloquially speaking, transmit that your imagination will be your own individualized tools provide whatever enhancements, whatever alterations will be perfect for you. Therefore, do not invalidate your imagination. Do not think you are doing it wrong. You are not. Whatever way, in whatever form you receive this is the way that it is intended to be received by you. And if you will but grant yourself that slack, as you say, you will then, oh wow, not make this image to appear. And do understand, the mechanism is always allowance. You never make or force anything to change. You simply make or force things to stay the same. Your change is the only constant in creation and is only let in by allowance. So therefore, in your relaxed state, muster up all the allowance that you can picture. And I will now transmit an image right now. How do you all feel? Sure, I feel real happy to get my hands on the other side. Again, feeling right in my state. That may be with many individuals the expression, the emotion, how we allow you to feel. Understand that this has locked in a particular image that we have physically transmitted. But also understand that these communications take place on many levels. Not only on a thoroughly through your ears, visually through your eyes, but also on other levels of your consciousness. We do dialogue from our higher self to your higher self. So if you do not receive a discrete image at that moment, worry not. Or it will drip into your awareness when and if it needs to. For sure. I think I was too afraid to see an image, but I felt I still feel. I don't know what opened my eyes, but I felt this amazing smile and joy come over me. Like I saw myself lifting up. Then you were in tactically in touch with the opposite side. For me in every given moment are always joyful, always ecstatic. And most of all, always excited. Therefore very often this will be the thing that you will pick up upon. Do proceed. It was very rich. It was very rich and very feeling. Thank you very much. We always sincerely communicate to you from our perspective. For the benefits shall we say of those who are a little bit more visually oriented. Allow a brief description of our physicality. In general beings upon our planet are five feet of your high form. Our skin is grayish white in coloration. Females have hair usually white. Males have no hair in the neck sense. You may say our bulb. Our eyes are all almond shaped, upturned, a bit oblonged in yours. Although our pupil is gray, it does encompass most of the eyes. So your perception would be that our eyes are black. They are not. Our nose is a bit smaller than yours. And our shall we say mouth is also. If there was one race that comes close upon your planet to how we look, it would be Mongolian, though not exactly. We thank you very much for your willingness in that way to share our energy. And again, if you had a particular expectation about the only way you would accept this image and it did not in that sense, fill into that mold. Do not worry yourself. Do not judge yourself. It will drift into again when and where it needs to. In general within your sleeping dream reality. So pay particular attention in the next three nights of your time to your dreams. And again we thank you. Share it. Yes, we learn all that much. I have a sharing. I shared with you the last time that I saw you that I hadn't seen the entity in about three weeks. So it's been about four weeks or so. The other night he did see him. And I was having a dream and I was walking out of the dream by the phone ringing once. So what I thought was the phone ringing once. And knocking at the door. And it startled me very much. It felt four, thirty, three, three in the morning. And when I opened my eyes, my heart was pumping. And when I opened my eyes, yes, he was in the room only. Normally he appears as light and at this time it was a fake. A fake fake. And he said the phone would change. Okay, but this is a strange part. The face looks like... You mean the other part with that straight? This is a strange part to me. Came towards me and very close to my face and then out the window. And what he looked like was a children's caricature of the sun. How beautiful. Very cool. He was very thick, smiling eyes and a very small mouth. Not at all in that way antagonistic. No. Oh, well. And so I just took that out of my wake-up call and I got it and put it on my TV corner. Now, may we, being that you have given us the allowance, make a comment? Yes. You have perceived that the entity has disappeared. Because in your past you have enabled and in that sense, allow the co-creation of an externalized symbol, correct? Yes. Do recognize. The reason it seems in that sense to not be out there anymore is because it is not. You are now beginning to internalize this energy, which is the way in that sense you will if you choose to challenge. Well, what happened that night was a lot of things happened and for the first 45 minutes, I had a 90 minute take on. For the first 45 minutes, just my cock was very violent, very strong. All of them. But again, you may wish to make these communications, but go off. Yes. I did wish to. And what it allowed me to realize is how much I didn't realize was before, how much fear I had. And how much I was not willing to surrender and let go. And your fear, incidentally, will always eat at least the screen or clothes. And then after a bit more time, I did get some messages. I don't think it was from the end state of it. One moment, do not invalidate. What messages speak them aloud now? Okay. Be bold. They, and I say they recognize this is the beginning of the end of your call. And they talked about my fear and I only heard it once. I haven't listened to it again. But, and that I was safe and there was no need to fear. And that I was protected even though I don't really need protection, I think I do. And that is why the symbol was provided. But you understand you do not in that sense need it. If you feel it is the only thing that will allow you to continue, there is enough unconditional love from that entity to even provide that symbol. Go on. And what else happened? A great relief of fear came from my solar classes or just a relief. I don't know what it was. Very good. You want to clean out those energy samples? And energy was going off my spine. And what else is said? They were saying that I don't know what the words were. But if I would walk through that door, I would have my heart to desire. I would have everything I want. And, and, and, oh, how they started the communication with by saying that I was the creator. You are now beginning to allow these communications to inflow. You are now beginning to receive them. This is very good. And then they said that I can have everything I want and the things I experience that I don't want. It's just because of my attachment to them and I can let them go. And you recognize that one way, not the only way that individuals in your society do determine what they prefer. All right. Is by giving themselves so many examples of that which they do not prefer, but you do not have to do that. Go on. That's, that was my own voice. And how did the channeling go from that to a deeper channel? Do you recognize that it will always be your own voice in that way, though this is the vocal expression of my energy. It is still the channel's voice. So the idea is just continue to do what you are doing, which is allowing the communications and validating it. As you have said, you did it once. You stuck your foot in. Got it a little wet. Found that you have the ability to still draw it back, still in your control. However, when you will begin to go ahead with this, shall we say the channel will be sitting there and you will be sitting here. Can you picture that in your imagination? All right. Very good. Then simply at your own pace, in your own style, walk through that door when and if you wish. You have had the reinforcement, the encouragement by the other side and accepted and validated it. You are channeling. Do not think you must do something to channel. You already are. Is this the persistence? Yes. From working on to trans channels. Do you have to let go more? Is that it? I don't exactly know. Simply in your case, for now, allow yourself to do whatever form of channeling you will. You will perceive it to initially be a light trans state. It will quickly move into what is labeled in your society, a medium trans state. That being that you will be aware of the words coming out. But they will seem most strongly to not be your own words. The next step of detrans channeling may or may not be something you desire. We say this because when you will allow yourself to do the medium state channeling, you may find that is sufficient. And it is not necessarily that you will feel the need to push aside your own consciousness because it is not in the way. Thank you very much. Well, thank you for creating and being willing to continue to explore it. And being willing to begin to express it, which when you will not stifle your communications, you will not feel the need to create the symbol of constantly coughing them out. And the cough will be gone. Will be transformed. It is already beginning to be served. And thank you. Incidentally, you do not necessarily usually cough in these interactions, do you? Very interesting. Thank you very much for your ongoing willingness to share with us. Ford, we love you greatly. Sharon? Yes. I was talking about communications. Can you allow us to move into the ribbons of light and color of communications to light forms? Am I clear enough? The idea being that light, white light is what comprises or makes up infinite creation. All that is, in a sense, is living, loving, ecstatic light. Not the type of narrow bandwidth you label light upon your planet, but far more of an idea of overall bandwidth, shall we say, labeled light. In your society, by filtering prismatically this white light, the visual white light you come up with varying wavelengths you labeled the color. And they do go from lesser vibration, red, to greater vibration, violet. And the idea being that there are some common symbols as to what colors mean, but they will always be very internal. Very interpreted by each individual. If, for instance, red to you means power, and to someone else it means fear, you are not right and they are wrong. It means this to you and that to them. There is no, in that sense, one thing, one reality for all individuals. So in that sense, it is very malleable. The effects of colors will again vary according to belief systems because this is what determines anything, the fact on you anyway. Does that answer the question? Yes and no. The answer? The most specific kind, that is, yes. Right. Can you receive light rays in different colors as it parts of different vibrations, as it parts of communications? Can you communicate in different level of colors to a vibration? In a sense. Light colors, I mean. In a sense, yes. If you were one to V, shall we say, sensitive to auras, V, shall we say, or it feels around the body of any individual. You would notice upon the introduction of our energy to the channel, a flash of green. This is, in a sense, one of the vibratory frequencies that we utilize in order to establish this communication. So in that sense, we do utilize it but do not label it. Our space craft are powered by light. They channel, if you will, light. And that is what allows us, in that sense, to roam the universe on multi-books. So we do utilize it in many ways. Simply, we do not have a singular meaning for each color. And our bandwidths will vary slightly from yours, so therefore our perception of color will be slightly different than yours. Do you have another question? Yes. Is there any way that we can tune ourselves into perceiving or vibrations and vibrations from music, vibrations from colors, any way that we can become a lot to us? Oh yes. And again, the most effective way of doing so will be emotionally. How does that color allow you to feel? How does that music allow you to feel? It is all vibration anyway. In actuality, different, shall we say, representations of the same one energy, vibrations. When you vibrate it a little bit faster, you perceive it as light. When you vibrate it a little bit slower, you perceive it as sound. But it is all vibration in that sense, all a product of the infinite creations light. Thank you. I'd like to inquire about animals. We have a special cat special to us. Her name is Sam. Oh right. And I've been told that it's good to talk to animals. Oh right. But then it is. They appreciate it. I wonder, do they understand my language? Do they understand English? It is simply that they're picking up on pitch and tone and such. It is more the idea of pitch and tone, but even more so, the idea of your intention. They empathize with you, shall we say, a different level altogether. So your overall intention as expressed through your vocalization is what they pick up upon. And it is not so much the idea of the words, although there is shall we say the possibility of them picking up a few words, for instance, they're named. Do you have another question? A walk and be glad. Do we attract certain creatures into our lives as we retract everything else? Oh yes, and again you may look at any moral consciousness as a reflection of your own consciousness at the same time having their own beingness and associative energy, which may also, as you do, reincarnate with you from life to life. What we most strongly perceive in your case with this particular cat is a connection to what you would label an Egyptian wife. But this, in your normal everyday framework, makes sense. Do you have an attraction, for instance, to that era? No, not particularly. Although I'm always like pyramids and tribals. Oh! Man, man, just ask you a question and a turn a moment ago. What is it about thinking of triangles to number three and things coming in three? From our perspective it is very, shall we say, fundamental. The idea being the polarities, positive, negative and the integration of the two, therefore being a fulcrum point between the two. The tetrahedral pyramid, which is a three-sided pyramid with a triangular base, is the first expression of volume. In other words, your triangle is two-dimensional. The first expression of a three-dimensional volume will be adding that third leg, if you will, and producing a tetrahedral pyramid. That type of pyramid channels energy in a very specific way, as opposed to the four-sided pyramid of your Egyptian era. I do not fear you. Oh, and we do not fear you either. And you recognize there is no reason inherently to feel us. If you feel that you are feeling us, you are activating beliefs within yourself, or there is nothing inherently fearful. And we thank you. Shading, come back, Foster. Yes. I guess it was a visitation a year ago, September. Oh, sorry. I was down in Florida, and at that time, put it off to just being a dream. And more recently, I have been willing to look at it more seriously. It is something more than that. An entity within my room, I was in a business trip, and it was in a hotel room. It was about three feet tall. And the only way to describe it was more like a fetus than anything else, and that there was a face for the eyes, nose and mouth, but they weren't fully formed. All right. And that is shall we say the appearance of a particular race, but Percy. All right. And no hair, and I don't remember arms and legs. My fear went from head to toe, and I tell us half that we heard from him. I am not here to hurt you. I have something to tell you. Telepathically, I said that to him. I'm not ready to hear it. At which point, I rolled over. The fear totally went away. There was no heart pounding like there would normally be when you have a dream or bad dream. I fell immediately to sleep, and just had a remembrance of exactly what happened the next morning. Can you give me any light as to what he wanted to tell me or where he from? The idea of being the origin point would be the zeta reticulum star system. What he was saying, he will say, when you will lie. Therefore, go right ahead. So I will have to see him again to hear what I need to hear. You will not have to, however you may choose to. And it is just as available now as it was then. However, now, if you have the fear reaction, which is most common in your society, begin to look at line. And if you wish to be even more creative, ask why. Allow yourself to integrate with that consciousness, and allow that consciousness to aid and assist you toward allowing the continuance of the communication. He will. Is that, and is there a lot of that type of entity among us? It is one of the most common, shall we say, direct interactions face to face upon your planet. And they are, shall we say, benevolent beings. But in coming to contact with their bio energetic field, their aura, which vibrates a bit faster than yours, it forces yours up to that level. And what this does, shall we say, colloquially speaking, is bring out the things you have hidden from yourself in your consciousness, which may be fearful to look at. And it is not the interactions which are inherently fearful, but those things you have tucked in your subconscious closet, refusing to look at that off. And what was the name of the words from the data curriculum? And if they start a system not visible in your hemisphere, however south of your equator, it is. On thank you, everybody. Can you tell us more about the, you just touched on the number three. Can you tell us a little bit about number seven and nine separately? In that sense, we allow you to proceed. I don't understand. What is your own impression of these numbers? I'm not too clear. I don't know what the point is. All right. Senator? One more. At this time, we are receiving no information along these lines. Interestingly enough, one more moment. Perhaps we will come back to that idea, but for now we simply trust when information is not, shall we say, for coming. That is not the time for it. Something came to me while you were thinking. Oh, but it was? And it had to do with the pyramid with four sides and the pyramid with three sides. But that's as far as it went. Oh, well, do recognize what we were tapping into is the maps consciousness in this room's impression of that. But it is so varied upon individuals that there is no, shall we say, one underlying universal meaning. And the physiological channel has no basis in what you label numerology. So therefore, there is not the background for us to draw upon in this channel. But we thank you, however, for asking so that the channel may become aware of something he may wish to look at. Thank you, Chair. Yes, amen. About a month ago, I became aware of my father. Oh, sorry. I've been here for about, yes, more than 30 years. And he wasn't a man I knew very well. He lived at home, but I didn't know him very well. And I really became aware of him, just in my mind. I didn't see him or hear of him. And I wondered if I could just trust him. Oh, yes. And do you understand that this time from our perception, he is acting as spirit God. The reasoning for the timing is that it coincides with your willingness to open up more portions of your consciousness. And therefore, by being existing on more levels yourself, there are more levels for, shall we say, him, colloquially speaking, to communicate through. Was he always there and I just wasn't aware of him or shall we say he was busy here and there in your attention. But now is what you would focus upon. The timing is specific, trusted. So he is. Elgin. From our perspective. Okay, thank you. I have another question. Oh, one moment. There will be very few moments left to this interaction. Proceed. At the end of my life, I will let the change to a certain level of consciousness. When I reincarnate, will I come in at that level? Or do I have to struggle through it? In the way that you mean? Yes. And you may look at it this way. Now, understand this is arbitrary and only applies to existence within a timeline. But the one thing you never quote, lose in that sense, even in your forgetfulness, imposing forgetfulness upon yourself from life to life, is any quote spiritual progress that you make. You always pick up in that sense from that point. If you will allow yourself in the next given life to wake up to it. That is why very often individuals will have notions, ideas that they have never learned in a particular life, but they are most comfortable to them. That is, shall we say, the carryover or spillover information. So fear not, you will not have to start again in that regard. And in fact, may be a bit more conscious in the in between period and thereby give yourself more choice of how and when to reincarnate. All right. Thank you. It's my email. Yes. I see a lot of explosions of like a flashbulb of light on the perimeter of my eyes and it's electric green and electric purple and sometimes white. All right. It's very beautiful colors. It always makes me feel hollow, you know, like that. And, but I don't teach directly in front of me, but like way over to the side perimeter of my eyes and says, what is that? In a sense, quite normal. And by focusing on a certain object, you will notice much activity within what you label your peripheral vision. In a sense, it is tapping into other levels of yourself that you bring back as a symbol of light. Is that all? At this time, we wish to express again our appreciation. Because you are willing to share with us, we are willing to continue to co-create with you. Although the day may come where we meet face to face, and I say, may because it does not have to, it is not a goal of ours. We have no goals. We simply live in the moment. It is no less joyful for us to communicate with you on this level. We do recognize that it takes within the parameters of your society a certain willingness to place yourself in a circumstance or situation to allow this type of interaction. We do recognize that the mainstream consciousness of your society does not accept this idea as valid. And thereby understand that you are overcoming these beliefs in order to continue to participate in co-creating with us. We thank you for this because we look at it and view it as the greatest gift that one can give. The gift of sharing any time that you create within your physical life life with any other being is truly a gift that we run. Therefore again, I express my appreciation and the appreciation of my society and the association of worlds and visually most fond and loving. Good evening.
