 Alright, I'll say I be you greetings this day of your time as you create time to exist. Allow me to begin with the following entitlement for this interaction. Your personal template by way of a preface. Allow me to simply say the very short exercise that we are about to share. Allow it to be natural. Listen to the words as they are spoken. Allow whatever naturally occurs for you to occur. Allow whatever reaction as you say or response that you have to come up. And simply have no, as you say, investment in any specific outcome. Close your eyes. At your own pace, in your own timing, take three deep and loving breaths all the way in, all the way out. As I have suggested, simply allow yourself in a calm state to simply hear the words that are being transmitted through the channel and allow anything that occurs to simply occur. There is no wrong way to do this. Begin by imagining the feeling of being excited. Allow every cell of your body to express the emotion you call excitement, passion or pure joy. Attach nothing to this. Simply drum up. Imagine. Project, if you will, without any background. Feedback, without any scenario, simply feel the vibration of excitement. Allow this to build up to whatever degree it naturally will in feeling every cell of your body. Relaxing with motivation, incentive, inspiration, pure excitement. And just imagine if you will, if this is the easiest way for you to drum it up, imagine how that feels, how it would feel. And allow yourself again naturally to whatever degree to feel excitement. Now understand in no uncertain terms that in order to imagine how it would feel to be excited. You literally create the excitement itself and there is not a one step removal. When you imagine how it would feel to be excited you are actually creating excitement. Therefore allow yourself to validate what you feel no matter what it is and continue to focus your consciousness on the idea of allowing yourself for no particular reason to feel excitement as opposed as you say to any other emotion. I will give you a moment. Now, to whatever degree you have created, whatever feeling that you are experiencing at this moment, notice the black screen from behind your forehead, the blank black screen that appears when you close your eyes and from the blackness or greatness. Now naturally, at whatever pace is comfortable for you, you to begin to see yourself now that you feel excited doing something and see what it is with the backdrop of the feeling of the emotion of excitement that you are doing. If this comes easily to you, all well and good. If you feel that it is not as you say coming simply allow yourself to continue to feel the emotion of excitement and see whatever pictures or images of yourself doing something with this excitement, notice how you are holding yourself. Notice how you are standing or sitting or lying down. Notice what you are doing. If there are other people in your vision, allow yourself to see your demeanor in interacting with them. Allow yourself to see the joyous and excited way you respond to them and allow yourself to see the joyous and excited way that you respond to them. In each instance, all of you will find that there is something in the scene that you would not have expected and so therefore allow your attention to be focused on the aspect of the picture you are creating in your consciousness. The aspect which is unexpected, the surprise, the element in the vision that you would not necessarily have thought would be there. Allow yourself to feel the joy of discovering that that unexpected element is something that also does excite you and make a note of whatever it is, no matter how as you say blatant or how subtle. So you see how you hold yourself, you see what you are doing that allows you to express your excitement and you see something that perhaps you did not expect in the picture also contributing to the vibration of the excitement that you are creating. Now I remind you, there is no incorrect way to do this and so no matter what you are getting, it will suffice, allow yourself to experience this for but another moment. Now gently at whatever pace is comfortable for you, allow yourself to begin to refocus your consciousness back to this space in what you call your outside surroundings and at your own pace begin once again to open your eyes and refocus your attention back to this interaction. Your imagination is an ability that you have to project yourself in hypothetical terms and can be used as a tool of alignment of a tool to focus your consciousness in a specific way. When functioning from the vibration of your excitement and seeing what it is that you can do that would express that excitement, you begin to create a model or a skeleton or a template of the energy of your consciousness around which physical reality can then layer itself. You do this all the time anyway. You always put out some template generally in the form of rigid expectations that your physical reality can then congeal, coagulate, contract around and so therefore you always set down the foundation of your own experience through what you call the focus of your consciousness. One to no uncertain terms that much of what we discuss in terms of creating an experience or a reality that you prefer boils down to the idea of the focus of your consciousness. For always do you focus your consciousness whether or not it is purposeful, pointed and intentional or whether you express that focus ironically as being completely scattered. The bottom line is you are focused on something and so the ability to focus is not an ability that you need to muster, is not an ability that you need to build or strengthen and simply by the mere, easy imposition of your intention and your commitment. You can at any given moment begin to direct that focus toward the you that you prefer laying down a conscious personal template of who you are. If you are willing to allow yourself to maintain that focus then you will begin to experience the outer reflections of that decision and choice. If you consecutively shift your focus from purposeful conscious intentionful focus to random disempowered focus you still get an effect. The effect is still a result of focus but that focus is not as you say consistently constructive toward the you you know in your heart of hearts you wish to be or more accurately the you who you know in your heart of hearts you already are. And so therefore as we have shared in our last interaction in beginning to define who you are factoring in the vibratory state of awareness you call excitement and seeing when already excited what types of things are you doing how are you expressing that excitement can always assist you to realign to who it is you truly wish to be consciously as opposed to other ways that you define yourself perhaps through the eyes of others or perhaps through evidence in your circumstance which is highly interpretable but you place a negative interpretation upon it. More truly all circumstance is a neutral set of props with no built in meaning there may be certain tendencies to label certain things in a certain way societally but you do not get the effect out of any circumstance until you assign the meaning and then act according to that expectation and create the self fulfilling prophecy of the circumstance being negative. If you are willing to create a positive focus for yourself you can very easily begin to interpret your circumstance through the positive orientation which is not a denial of any inherent negative outer circumstance it is a shifting of the focus of your consciousness to begin to allow the positive meanings to filter in more automatically more naturally for once you determine who the preferred you is and then determine that you will be that preferred you and in fact are that preferred you that decision is registered across the board it is now who you are until you change your decision and therefore your willingness to interpret circumstance as being a result of that decision rather than evidence contrary to that decision allows you to begin to glean from circumstance rather than use it as evidence that you are not moving are not growing and are not changing and so therefore your willingness to remain focused on who it is you desire to be allows you to maintain the approach of interpreting your circumstance through the eyes of that person through the senses of the preferred you the moment you decide I am this preferred self you already are that person and so all circumstances can only be a reflection of that decision though you will only experience it that way at first because of your previous tendencies if you consciously remind yourself in other words you remain focused on who you are to interpret all circumstance from the perspective of how does this serve me how does this reinforce my decision though there may be elements that would seem to contradict it that obviously is not the point because the me that I now am is supported by my circumstance is supported by my relationships is supported by my experience and so therefore my interpretation of my experience can now occur from the perspective of the preferred me you already do what we are saying even if the way you express it is the constantly shift your focus perhaps sometimes individuals will say I choose to be this empowered being then a circumstance will come along neutral but there are certain elements of it that could be they don't need to be they don't have to be but they could be interpreted as evidence that well I'm not that person but never never never is that the only meaning that you can glean from the circumstance always always always in every circumstance is there also aspects of it usually by the way blatant so you only need open your eyes and look for them that absolutely will support your new decision of who you are and then result in you placing less significance on the more negative seeming aspects of the circumstance in other words all circumstance contains the ability to interpret it negatively or positively no matter what even the most positive thing that you can imagine if you played the game of saying all right what would a pessimist find wrong with this you will find something for that is how circumstance being a neutral statement being a reflection of who you are and not something that results in who you are that is how circumstance works and so it always contains the infinite potential to be interpreted in either way now often when we discuss this individuals will say well simply what you are doing is telling me to look at the world through rose colored glasses and deny the things that I know are negative in my experience this is not precisely what we are saying because we are not saying to avoid looking at the negative aspects but simply instead to focus on to concentrate to have the intention of finding the positive aspects and that is not running from the seeming negative aspects that is simply walking toward the positive aspects which automatically distances you from any negative seeming component to an experience and so therefore it is simply exercising your ability to choose who you are and not seeing the world in a distorted way one might argue that continuing to place negative interpretations upon all circumstances is perhaps more inherently distorted since you are inherently positive creative consciousness being and so therefore perhaps you can say in many ways your more natural tendency is to actually express the positive and you can do so while being aware that there are negative aspects there is no need to deny them you can say well there is a component of this experience that I would have labeled negative but obviously that is not the point of the experience because I am now this person focused conscious preferred person and therefore though I see this negative component that is not what I will focus on because I know all circumstance always contains both and generally you can allow the positivity in any circumstance to come to the surface by asking yourself how does this serve me exactly the way it is as opposed to why is this happening to me poor little old me and so it is all a matter of taking what you already do focus and having that focus be consistent and this is your personal template the conscious purposeful excited integrated version of who you know yourself today by allowing yourself to define that that is what allows you to create your personal template if you will and so therefore most of you in simply playing with me in the aforementioned exercise first creating the vibration of excitement did see yourself doing things did see unexpected aspects and joyous aspects to the things that you were doing perhaps many of you said well I knew that excited me perhaps many of you also said I didn't know I was excited about that and have discovered something new but the overall idea is that you are the only one who knows who you are you are the only one who knows how it feels to be excited and so therefore you can always in any given moment produce the sensation of excitement perhaps in a once removed way by saying I will imagine how it would feel to be excited but once you drum up any sensation of the excitement you are no longer imagining it you are creating it you are being it using your imagination to do so but the moment you feel it you are excitement itself and if you then begin to see what types of things you would do being and feeling excited you create an alignment within yourself that honors who you know yourself to be as you say in your heart and so therefore it is always an option to have your focus be conscious to have your focus be a choice and not a set of circumstance dictated to you by the reality that you've been thrust into and locked into which is only a focus thinking that you are trapped in this reality thinking that you are inherently a negative being is a focus and that is why if you experience this from time to time that you do because your focus shifts and you need not as you say panic if you have noticed that your focus shifts because in noticing that it has shifted you must be back into your original consciousness to see the difference otherwise you wouldn't even notice that it has shifted and so noticing that you have shifted to perhaps a more negative perspective is the same as now being back in the positive perspective and allowing you to remain there consciously if you assign negative meaning you will get negative effect and many times not allow yourself to have the advantage of the positivity also built into the circumstance but the converse is also true when you assign positive meaning when you invest positive definition then there may be a nuance that to some people this would be a negative thing but your effect out of it is support your effect out of it is reinforcement reinforcement of who you've chosen to be because as we have said you will always focus your consciousness somewhere and if you are not doing it consciously then you express it in what you call a random manner which appears to be unconscious but that is a shell game of consciousness it is actually still a conscious decision conscious decision is simply doing this because I say so because I know this is who I am because I am awake aware and lucid of who I am and so therefore your life becomes a lucid dream which it already is from time to time when you wake up to who you are because you always express yourself in some way because you always focus your consciousness in some way now is the time and now is the threshold for getting a hold of that and acting like a creator at least in the aspect of being willing to know who you are and being willing to know that that expression is then supported by your circumstances supported by your experience and when you at first need to look for how a circumstance supports you you will very quickly see that all circumstances always do and as you become more akin more natural toward your first tendency of interpretation being a positive interpretation the formerly defined negative aspects of circumstance will seem to disappear you will see an inherent change in the neutral props so that they will have the appearance of being more positive even though they are still literally just as neutral the face of the circumstance and experience changes when you change your focus and here's the key maintain the focus now all of this is simply a slightly different wording of making a decision about who you are maintaining that decision or trusting that you have indeed registered that decision and then performing your actions and outward responses in alignment with the decision not an alignment with negative circumstance that you have defined as evidence against your decision and so therefore introducing the idea of focusing your consciousness allows yet another level of simplicity toward expressing yourself for when you are negatively aligned for any reason you can simply remember I am focusing on negativity I am focusing on a negative version of myself and so that is why I feel this reality is not betraying me it is supporting the fact that at this moment my focus is on a negative idea or a negative presentation or a negative version of yourself and again the mere realization that I am focused in negativity comes from the space of being able to see the difference and so therefore comes from the space where it is completely effortless to shift your focus back where you say you want it and when your reality seems to run things are going well they are not going well they are going well they are not going well it is not a treadmill reality that you are within it is the result of the shifting of your focus back and forth I am a conscious being I am a random being I am a being where the reality comes from me I am a being who exists within a reality as a victim of it these are the shifting focuses and never can you have a negative experience or a negative interpretation unless you are focused on the negative aspects of yourself and therefore allowing the interpretation to be according to negative terms the reason that this sounds so simple is because it is the other reason that it sounds so simple is because you are masters and experts at focus perhaps to this point it has been masters and experts at random follow the bouncing ball focus now we are discussing consistency not necessarily by the way does consistency or persistence or commitment need to mean a great effort for it is actually far more simple and natural to express your positive understanding because your positive understanding takes into consideration more of the integral and integrated and interwoven nature of all things which actually emanate from your consciousness and not the other way around though you can still live as though you are in a reality and still explore your consciousness from the perspective of being a physical being you need not continue to create a roller coaster ride of results a roller coaster ride of what you call emotionality unless of course that is part of what it takes you and for some of you it is and so therefore never are you kept from yourself never can life slip away never can you truly back slide to who you were because you now have or at least the apparent is you now have more information and therefore you are inherently different than you quote unquote were so you can play a game I am this old me again but you are truly this old you plus realizing this as well can allow you to real line to shift to re point your focus consciously now here is perhaps you can say my promise to you all if you are willing to maintain your positive focus of the excited creative inspired productive you no matter what and begin to interpret all of your experience through the eyes of that preferred you your life will instantaneously totally 100% without exception shift and say there and this is how integral apart you are in establishing your own experience and this is what we more literally mean by create your own reality it is perhaps more accurate for the purposes of this discussion at least you say create your own experience which can be consistently positive even though you may have an awareness of negativity that awareness will be others choosing to focus and express negativity and not you and that is not denial that is being willing to be aware of both polarities but consciously choosing to express the positive polarity you contain it all there is no outside if you feel that you learn something if you feel that someone else inspires you truly that is a misconception for everything that you interact with everything that you perceive is a reflection of your consciousness and is therefore a reflection of the focus of your consciousness which only you determine and there is your power as you say on a silver plate only you determine your focus and if you are saying I am unfocused you are simply focusing on randomness allow me to also say as you begin to be willing to express who you are no matter what in positive terms with the understanding that individuals that you create as interacting with you have a reason to be there you will begin to see those around you seem to change for the way that you interpret them the way that you interpret their actions will be a new will be according to your new positive focus and so it goes back to the edict that we have shared as have many in your society many times that as you change as you change your focus others seem to change as well circumstance seems to change experience seems to change but it is only truly your focus changing and then the allowance of the fulfillment of the reflection from your reality to match your focus which you do flawlessly every single time and so therefore when you begin to live this way there is no insistence on imposing your focus on someone else presenting it yes you attracted them for a reason perhaps to just to share what has worked for you but the extent of your contribution is an eloquent statement of what has worked for you why and how not that the person must then do this thing or not that what you are doing is actually any better than what they are doing though the outcome of what you are doing may be more positive all choices all results all circumstances in a qualitative sense are truly equal and so therefore your willingness to present who you are with no investment that a person needs to do any particular thing with it will allow you to express yourself with no pressure will allow you to express yourself more effortlessly and will allow you to be responsible to other individuals without then also feeling responsible for them which you cannot only they can be responsible for themselves as you are responsible for yourself ultimately as well and so therefore when we communicate with you this is why we have the attitude that our job per se is to simply state who we are to interact with the reflections that we attract with absolutely no investment that you change with absolutely no interpretation that there is anything wrong with the way you are expressing yourself to me you are all 100% perfect beings perfection is not something to strive for perhaps that is a societal motion that there is some societal ideal to strive for but fundamentally you are all perfection in motion you are a perfect reflection at every given moment of whatever it is you are expressing at that moment and due to the nature of being finite that can vary across the board so there is not one definition of perfection that would necessarily take everything into consideration and so therefore you need not strive to be who you are simply allow yourself to get in touch with who you are which lays down the template the skeleton if you will upon which your physical circumstance your relationships and your reality then appears to build itself and this is already happened in any state of awareness that you are already in in any set of circumstances that you have already created an experience you have laid down a template in your consciousness again generally not purposefully focused and allow the reality to build itself around it what we are discussing now is the age of being conscious about it allowing the template to be a statement that you are making rather than an interpretation of who you are based on the reflections in the external reality and so therefore conversely when you hear something that you find most joyous when you feel that you have learned something from an external reflection it is truly something you already knew and are simply now willing to look at are now understanding that it is the timing to express for you are fundamentally an infinite being that contains everything no exceptions and so the appearance you call evolution the appearance you call growth the appearance you call expansion is simply an experience that you choose to create because it's there as an option but it is illusory and that you are already fundamentally all knowing all seeing containing this knowledge if you begin to trust who you are fundamentally you will know that in any given circumstance or situation you always have all the tools you always know what you need to know when you need to know it and so therefore it is not a matter of having to gain something to be who it is you prefer it is a matter of choosing to express yourself as the person you prefer in return for your willingness to concentrate your focus in terms of such an interaction as this allow me to express my gratitude and appreciation for your willingness to perhaps create a mass focus if you will that occurs as each of you match your focus with our intended focus as well and create a resonance a harmony of intention a harmony of exchange and a forum through which we can express ourselves and all learn from one another for from my perspective you are all reflections of my consciousness anything you reflect back to me allows me to learn more about myself this is also true paradoxically for all of you where you are the creator you are the center and we are all the reflections within your consciousness how can this be you ask how can we all be this that is the nature of infinity that is the nature of moving beyond what you have considered to be the finite boundaries of reality and that is generally also what you refer to as paradox things that would seem to not be able to exist at the same time simultaneously but indeed do and that's that and so therefore everyone experiences the reality as being from them and everyone is absolutely correct no matter how baffling this may seem you will begin to experientially understand this more and more but from a personal point of view all that is important is what you are creating how you are focusing your consciousness how you are interpreting your reality and how you are then walking in action and putting out in your reality it's all up to you and I thank you for your willingness to extend your focus into the idea that I consider myself to be as a being for your willingness to interact with us in this way again I thank you and ask how we may mutually be of service to each other through sharing and sharing will this be another telepathic session or does someone prefer to ask or state proceed mail greetings it's been at least two or three years as we count time since I first from you about the association of world you tell us what's happening there are many different occurrences happening one of the reasons from our particular point of view for shifting the focus away from that is to encourage for individuals to remain grounded in their reality paradoxically it is being willing to ground yourself in your own reality live your own life express yourself as fully as you are willing that will eventually allow the frame of consciousness that will provide the gateway between what you call interaction between your society and other societies which originate from elsewhere in the known multiverse and so therefore we have perhaps you can say refrain from focusing in that direction to maintain a grounded focus the idea being however that there is some degree of coordination the association in that sense is in a very exploratory mode whereby many civilizations are operating in tandem to perhaps a right map the known physical universe and much of the observations much of the idea of the focus of this will be from an unobtrusive point of view in other words when as an association of many different world societies and consciousness we become aware of what you would call a planet with what you would perhaps call intelligent life for lack of a better term we do not interfere we do not make our presence known we simply observe we simply perhaps you can say loosely speaking catalog and so for the purposes of remaining six things and restoring the focus to the grounded idea of this discussion I will simply say we are out and about exploring the neighborhood that will be arbitrary and ever shifting depending upon which node we are communicating to you from for the ideas that we recognize what you call the existence of many simultaneous dimensions of experience many which physically overlap and are unaware of each other so that question becomes very arbitrary in that life is a number that will do but it is not truly accurate is that all no are there other are there other galaxies how many galaxies are represented in the association are all galaxies represented to not again yet too mechanically confusing you would understand it basically basically speaking to consist of free galaxy you are considering and asking the question is that there is one physical reality and as I have said there are many overlapping dimensions the idea is that the expanse of the agreement between societies will scan many hundreds of thousands of light years of space which includes perhaps you can say in a localized sense three galaxies this is very arbitrary and again we would choose not to focus upon this I see are all the members either force entity or higher no we might qualify even though we don't maybe yet achieve force density we have discussed with you and no uncertain terms that your willingness to walk in a certain way has you expressing yourself in those terms and you are in that sense perhaps you can say a limited member when you do so when your society begins to do so in tandem then there is what you would perhaps refer to as a formal invitation to join in a more shall I say direct physical way but you can walk that talk right now one last question there's been a lot of excitement the last few days here somehow there's a piece of meteorite or something from Mars they decided it just might show that there was life billions of years ago of a primitive form on Mars let me ask you is there life of an intelligent nature right now on Mars or has there been there is not what you would call a living society germane to that planet at this moment there has been in no uncertain terms in its history there are artificial structures upon that planet which will be discovered and to some degree already have though perhaps there has been some misunderstanding about their significance and because of your recent discovery there is more of a likelihood to move in the direction to be able to discover some of the things that I am speaking about and being purposely vague about thank you very much I have done nothing thank you shitting female hot to you and myself all right I touch and opening statement how do you and your civilization learn from us and I was wondering I get a lot of a lot from these sessions and listening to you what do you get from us and then then I had an answer to my mind especially exciting hard to us on a I hear that there is a transformational age and I see you as people and loving I feel that if you want to help us to do this cognitively important perhaps I would take exception to that wording for I'm not here to help you you are not in need of help I am here because you have expressed the threshold willingness to reflect the next level of expanded consciousness and I simply represent one avenue through which you reflect that back to yourself so it is your own readiness not any sense from our end that you need saving or assistance without which you are helpless we immediately acknowledge your complete power and sovereignty as a creative force as a creative being do proceed okay I use you as a positive tool and thank you but please tell me when you say things like we learn from you learn more about ourselves to you meaning us being honest manager that's what you mean oh thank you do understand our focus individually and collectively would perhaps be perceived as you value as being 100% consistently completely positive I never have an experience that has any tinge of a negative interpretation or a negative feeling now I have in other lives I have in that sense being an infinite being that has also expressed myself in many different ways have the opportunity to explore these things but this is not your main to our focus right now and so one of the things we learn in interacting with you is the many varying degrees of persistence that you continue to insist keeps you down brings you down now I do not mean this in any way shape or form by way of a judgment we find it fascinating we do not consider negative expression in any way shape or form helpless in fact it is quite the reverse we consider individuals willing to express negativity as being very inherently strong able perhaps you can say in your vernacular gutsy and so therefore the lengths that you will go to to continue to express negativity the ingenuity through which you will continue to express negativity is fascinating to us in seeing the veracity if you will of consciousness now that is one idea another idea is quite the opposite your willingness to pick yourself up not again meaning that there is anything wrong with any way that you express yourself but it is a joy and a fascination to watch individuals click over to the idea that they've always created it to begin with and that being conscious and focused about it is an option and that it is an option that perhaps you might wish to express and so therefore as individuals do that even only even a given moment or whether they continue to do it consistently throughout their lives we learn things about the way that individuals will hook into the positive approach that reinforces our positive approach as well the assistance that i glean happens on a subtle level and perhaps do you may sound as low it is not that significant perhaps i will ask that you simply take my word that for me it is and so it also is for members of my society lastly our society by choice is telepathic we have remnants of an ancient language but essentially do not speak and communicate what you would call telepathically therefore the nature of our expression is inherently different from your own in that we do not create the idea you call privacy we do not create the idea you call isolation we do not create the idea of feeling so removed from what you call source what you are source so you can never be removed from source except to define that you are and experience the appearances that you are and so we find that fascinating as well there are many things that are fascinating to me another thing is how you will respond and react to what you call unexpected outcome many times individuals in your society will take an unexpected outcome in a situation as an interruption that something could possibly happen that could stop you from being who you are this we find fascinating the idea being that you always are who you are as well there are many different nuances of how you express yourself that we learn from does that answer the question it does i thank you and i i do take your words for it oh what i have one more thing i want to bring up and that would be the twa crash that happens maybe two weeks ago or something and my my gut feeling is that it was not the terrorist and that's the media of trying to play out that maybe it was terrorist who would make this plane crash i kind of feel that it was an error with with the airplane that is not my perception but i will say no more i i also understand that i don't have got a clear or just meaning yet for myself what the whole crash what about and how it affects me and and everybody else well when you do then you will have your meaning for that is again a matter of individual focus and there will literally be as many different purposes as there are individuals involved both directly and both from an observational standpoint so therefore to plug it into being practical what did it mean to you how did you feel about it and why what did you learn about it what perhaps did you interpret that was negative about it so that you can see where you still have the tendency to interpret things in negative terms there is a lot of opportunity in any circumstance that stands out to reflect aspects back to yourself and learn more about who you are what stands out for you as being most obvious from you having been aware of that circumstance okay first of all i feel now i feel there's still a detached from it but i'm aware that it's a lot of people who felt emotionally did affect a lot of people earlier on getting globally i'm going to detach from it it makes me realize that i'm attached from a lot of other things too that go down in this world but i'm aware that it just means something that it does have a powerful and a negative impact on people and i'm just i'm sensing that and that's all i can say right now my simple suggestion would be allow things to be surface evidence if it means something to you use it if it does not move on simple as that the symbol will be very conveniently appropriate for everyone and whatever function it serves for them my reality i didn't want to believe that it was a terrorist act but um by the way i did not say that but i did not deny it either if i come up with something i'll share it again so thank you oh all right i thank you as well sharing a smile three times one moment your next protein me oh thanks uh mr right mr left go mr right thank you all right greetings online and to you good day greetings to android too i haven't seen him yet all right you can read him at the break okay um i can actually follow up on sracis um question answers because it did mean something to me well right do share well and everyone percup yes you can do that a lot to do for by the way not only can individuals learn about their perception of what happened you can also learn grow and reflect by listening to someone else's version do proceed right lately um past few weeks or so i've been exploring and experiencing adapting a rebirth process russian burn and then the rising from the ashes new proceeds and that is one way to do it by the way again it's healing away that's the uh the onion you know once again in my life and it's been very powerful and positive and um it brought up some things a lot to talk about but i will highlight on three sleeping dreams that i did have and i've been pulling them together so that i can get some of the answers that i'm seeking and i'll briefly describe the three dreams and then maybe we can talk about that all right perhaps the first dream i had first night was i was found myself standing on on this jet in the passenger uh plane and i was so surprised i was there and in the plane was everybody they were all scrapping their seats they were very content happy their children there everybody who i saw on the media were in the plane the front of the plane was gone it was there it seemed like it existed in some holding place and i was surprised i was there and i looked at them and i started to cry and they all looked at me and said why are you crying ah and i said um i looked at them i looked at a child and i told them that i identified with all of them apparently not by the way yeah i see too i said i looked at them i said i know all of you so well for some reason and i'm not sure why and it was really powerful obviously and that was it well the idea also being that although you play very effectively very convincingly the game of being finite you are infinite beings that are made of if you will pure consciousness and so from one way of looking at it they died big bummer the other way of looking at it is they simply pass on to transform and allow themselves to express themselves once again in whatever way they choose and so therefore nothing has truly been lost this is exemplified by the symbol of contentment and calm that they have inside the dream and why i say that you in that sense were not properly or perhaps fully identifying with them is because the emotion of loss and sadness was not necessarily a component of their experience being that close to the edge and then suddenly as you say transforming from their physical body and finding they still indeed exist proceed i'd like to add that i did finally i looked at them and i said oh i found you so i said it was some sort of an error of the rescue mission for me and i thought why isn't they can't find you but i found you i will say that i thought the thing all right dream number two number two was the next type very briefly i was standing in a completely white space and there was a transparent like glass or plastic wall in front of me and behind this glass wall were about five of me and i the most the multiplicity moving i think that's all there but um i went up to the glass and i kissed each one of them through the glass oh how exciting so you know and that was really sweet moving that was really interesting third night um i was running through the woods with a lot of Bigfoot kind of creatures hooked up saw spacecraft saw a window in the spacecraft with a bunch of like my marty draw heads which i thought was amusing the cartoon like and all they could think of was you saying remember to wave so i wave thank you thank you i was much real clean in one way and it was really i don't know each one had an impact that i can't describe here but um you did a very good job okay um yet summing it up this rebirth that i'm feeling and experiencing um what can you add and what can you maybe help me to answer my questions the idea is being willing to recognize yourself as an infinite being being willing to love in that sense yourself and being willing to in that sense greet yourself and others in a way that allows for you to express the respect for the sovereignty of the other as well as yourself great you created good job i work with that thank you very much i thank you male mr left i guess i lost the duking um never lost by the way first i want to say hi to all of you guys and gals on epsilon more waving thank you and i assume that there's others listening in as well to this interaction to whatever degree that is necessary for their growth yes and by the way since jim was the last year he had suggested to you uh some weeks back the idea of that invisibility thing i've had a chance to actually do that i have you laid around and had some fun with the idea you call invisibility you surprised it was the hit of the party as you know uh the caps out of the bag on the fact that we're writing a book including the eight sessions that were basically filed under the category of simplification from the decision through factoring in your excitement and maoi and i have had a lot of fun editing and formatting the information or perhaps it might just as aptly be called cosmic coaching all right having fun writing about fun and excitement good touch in fact in the excitement exercise i actually envision myself at the computer screen doing the formatting on the book which happens to turn out to be one of my very most exciting things as well as interacting with you right now oh what and as i've been doing this i've been discovering and really quite impressed and i actually want to congratulate you on how precisely you use our language almost to what i would consider a completely choreographed word by word yeah form even though it seems to be just coming off the top of your head well all right the top of my head do understand that all this will only ever boil down in your experience to your ability to interpret and make sense of what you perceive as being said so take the congratulations as well as you give it and i'm finding that in the book form it allows us to slow down and savor the flavor of every nuance of distinction of our language and our information that uh you so wonderfully present as such a bright and shining and clear mirror for us so i want to thank you all right excellent imagery i appreciate it thank you ah this timing we will pause for a break during which i ask that you continue to stay in touch with the vibration of feeling excited see what comes up and to whatever degree you are willing to discuss that when we return it will be my joy to do so
