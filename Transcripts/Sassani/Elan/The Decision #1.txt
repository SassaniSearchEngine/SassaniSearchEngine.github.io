 All right, I'll say, how are you all the stay of your time as you create time to exist? Oh, thank you. Allow me to begin by expressing my unconditional love and appreciation for your willingness to co-create this interaction this evening of your time. How do we do we respond to the request of the desire to interact in this way and therefore each and every interaction that we partake of with members of yours and any other respective society that we may find ourselves attracted to is always the result of willingness to communicate and co-creation of the interaction. Therefore I do not in any way shape or form inhabit the body of any particular individual that is not the mechanism through which these interactions take place. What occurs is that any particular biological individual or entity is enabled through a process that we co-create to empathetically mimic my vibration, the vibration of my consciousness, the vibration of what you were referred to as my individuality or signature vibration. So therefore we co-create these interactions with any respective channel and with any participants in any of these interactions. I therefore thank you once again for your willingness to create such a joyful interaction which brings us great joy. You really are already containing anything that you seek to know, anything that you seek to experience anything that you seek to create. I can say this because I understand your nature as a being or a beingness and each and every one of you are multidimensional, infinite and eternal by nature, multidimensional, infinite and eternal by nature. You are creating what you refer to as your physical lives to in that way partake of one option of creation which is the experience of what you call linear reality. Linear reality contains the idea of what you call space and therefore the idea of time to seemingly move through that space, experience that space. The creation of before, during and after is one of the sub-characteristics of linear reality and allows you to experience yourself in such a way, in such a focused manner whereby perhaps until you begin to entertain the notion you are not completely aware that you are indeed multidimension, infinite and eternal. The way that you create physical experience, linear reality, finite reality is through a methodology which in a sense, it is only an appearance but in a sense breaks down your consciousness or shall I say, gradiantly expresses your consciousness. In other words, you are an all knowing, all seeing, simultaneous, multidimensional, eternal, infinite consciousness. In that you experience everything is contained within your consciousness, within the infinity of your consciousness. From your infinite point of view there is no within and without, for these are linear terms but from the viewpoint that you create, linear point of view your body is literally within your consciousness and not the other way around. Therefore you already contain it all, all knowledge, all experience, all ideas and what you call growth and learning is only one of the characteristics of linear reality and in that sense is truly from your infinite point of view and illusion. Therefore you already know it all therefore the idea of not knowing something and then learning it is simply an exploration and a parent. Therefore since you already contain it all and express yourself on a line for now, you will create the aparency of learning but the mechanism is truly simply now expressing more of yourself, more of your infinite potential, more of what you know to be true for you. And therefore anything that rings true with you, anything that you understand to be true at any given moment you already contained to begin with. As you begin to entertain the idea of yourself as pure consciousness, as an infinite being, you begin to then attract to yourself within the physical parameters that you set up, resources, information, timing that allow you to begin to express more and more and more and more of who you already are, not becoming something that you are not but simply expressing more of who you already are. One way of looking at this is that your vibration as a consciousness begins as you express yourself in physical terms as a very contracted vibration. This allows you to experience the aparency of forgetting 99.9999 and so on and so forth percent of who you are to experience the infinitesimal decimal place point one of who you now choose to express yourself as. Your vibration therefore becomes contracted in a physical sense. As you begin to expand your notion, your acceptability of who you are, your vibrational resonance rises and you sometimes refer to it as your vibration ascending. Therefore, truly, truly, ascension is simply being willing to express more of who you already are and is not somewhere to go to from here because as you expand the idea of who you are, you understand both here and there exists within you and there is no separation. Therefore ascending is truly simply being more of yourself. So, when defining the idea of ascension will often assume that you are ascending away from this physical reality. Now that is one way to experience it. That is one idea of the result of the process of ascending or expanding your vibration. Understand in no uncertain terms that you have chosen to be here, chosen to be here to again, as we have said, experience yourself in a very specific way within a reality with very specific parameters. Because of these specific parameters, there are very unique characteristic advantages to the physical experience and when in that sense you are all knowing, all seeing simultaneous, there are certain nuances or qualities which have less meaning to you in that state. One is the idea of learning. One is the idea of discovery. One is the idea of surprise. All of these ideas become somewhat irrelevant when you already know it all. So therefore, advantages of what you call the physical reality include discovery, the joy of discovery and surprise or unexpected outcomes. Or one idea of expressing ascension is to begin to willingly participate in the creation and experience of your reality consciously because you say so. And very literally, if you are to ascribe levels to the idea of ascension, the first level of ascension would be ascending into living this reality fully with absolutely no nuance, no hint of the idea of escaping from this reality, of ascending away from this awful place as you will sometimes refer to it. Or the idea of ascending or expanding your vibration is a joyful celebration of more of who you already are. And nothing need be given up in terms of becoming more of who you already are. Once you contain it all, there is no outside, there is no external, there is nothing but you experiencing yourself. So therefore, you cannot really escape from yourself because all you would achieve in that sense is going to yourself anyway. Everything familiar with this idea allows you to now understand in no uncertain terms there is nowhere to go. You're already there. And understanding, deciding that you are already there allows you to experience the advantage of what you have already in no uncertain terms created as your reality. Therefore diving into your reality, being willing to decide your reality is one way in any given moment that you can transform your reality. Now I had mentioned earlier on that you break down or gradiantly express your consciousness from that one eternal infinite being. The convention through which you express this is what we generally refer to as a triad of belief systems causing emotions, causing thoughts and ultimately resulting in action. The paradox of the idea that your reality is the result of your beliefs, emotions and thoughts and actions is that you do not have one belief and not have another. As I said, you contain it all. You contain all beliefs. Simply the belief that you can possibly mention or think of. You also contain the opposite belief. I mentioned this distinction not to confuse you, not to confound and befuddly you, but to simply point out that if you understand that you already contain it all, then there is nothing to get rid of or process through and there is nothing to gain or achieve. There is simply and it all boils down to one word, decision. It is up to you in any given moment to express who you prefer to be versus who someone else says you should be, who you think you should be out of obligation to everyone else or whatever your rationale is for maintaining a state of consciousness which does not allow you to express joy in your life. Your birthright is joy. Your birthright is ecstasy. These are not things you need earned from the ultimate sense of that term. They are things that you will sometimes determine. Decide that you must earn, but you are the ultimate dictator of your reality. Therefore you and only you can decide, well, all right, there is this concept of ecstasy. There is this concept of joy. Once I earn it, I get it too. Well, yes, you contain it all. If you have that particular approach, you can create the transparency of not deserving your joy, taking a series of steps or actions, earning, earning the deservability to express and experience joy, and then ultimately experiencing the joy. However, the interesting point is that the moment you decide you have earned the right to express your joy and express it, it is truly not the process of having earned it that creates the joy in your life. It is the decision in the moment that you finally make the decision using the process, using the dues that you have paid as an excuse to now express that joy. All the criteria, all as you sometimes refer to it as the baggage, is set up by you and you only. In every given moment, you are always expressing some version of who you believe yourself to be. You decide in each and every moment who you are. You create 100% fully who you are in each and every moment, right now, right now, right now, and right now. Your now is the only time that is truly, truly real. Your infinite consciousness is one eternal now, simultaneous now. And as a linear expression whereby you create the appearances of a linear progression of now's, in each of those now's, which by the way, are all truly the same now, you make a decision, I am this person, I am this person, I am this way, I am that way. You generally do so through a labyrinth set of criteria. Perhaps you say, I am this person because this happened when I was a child. Perhaps you say, I am this person because these circumstances would only happen to a person such as this. Perhaps you say, I am this person because everyone tells me I am. Therefore, they must be onto something. But ultimately, it is your decision. It is your agreement with whatever that criteria may be. I am this person that allows you to express from the all that you contain that version, that person that you are being in that moment. The reason that you experience yourself as a linear being rather than a completely new person with a different body, different hair color, different eye color, different height, different weight, and each and every moment is because as you define yourself in any given now moment, you bring along the baggage, you bring along a conception. Well, you will often say, I am this person who is exactly the same person that I was a moment ago with this one minor little difference. And of course, you will experience the result of that one minor little difference with the appearance of being the same person. Now we do not share this so that you will spontaneously disintegrate your entire personality and completely transform this reality into an unrecognizable form. That is an option by the way. But you need not do that in order to recreate yourself according to preference in any given moment. By simply being willing to be mindful of the decision you are making right now and then perhaps dialoguing with yourself to determine who it is you prefer to be right now. That is all it takes to completely and 100% transform your entire experience right now. You already do this anyway. I am not suggesting or introducing anything that you are not an expert at. And as we sometimes say, you are perfect create horse. So when you create misery, it is perfect misery. When you create joy, it is perfect joy. But always does it hinge on the decision in the moment of who you are. In general how you express this as physical beings is by number one, making the decision this is who I am. You then number two, trust that decision. Well I must be that person. You then number three, act or perform an action in your reality with the foundational underlying supposition that this is who I am and it is those action in a physical reality that seem to cause results in a physical reality that seems to reinforce in a physical reality the decision. Therefore whatever you decide you get and whatever method that you use as an excuse to make that decision, the decision still sticks. As an example, individuals will often assume in order to transform to the individual that I prefer to be. I must understand who I am already being and often they will create an elaborate process. In elaborate and painstaking exploration of why or why am I who I am. The interesting thing is that as they are in that sense partaking and creating this process, they continually re-establish the decision this is who I am. As you dig into your path to determine why you turned out in such an undesirable way should that be a reproach, you continually reassert who you are. You continually maintain the decision that I am this person that needs so much work. There can be value when you insist on moving on a gradient to all of this type of exploration. However if transforming instantaneously appeals to you, maybe it doesn't, but if it does, you need not carry around the baggage, all that you need to do to transform right now is simply as you say in your vernacular, take the bull by the horns and simply have your decisions about who you are, be conscious and purposeful. Perhaps you may wish to include the idea of factoring in your preference. This is who I desire to be. Now when you state this is who I desire to be, you can very, very simply digress, well this is who I am being even though I desire to be this person. But that is not the same as simply deciding this is who I am. Because this is what I prefer, this is how I see myself. This is the person I love and your willingness to simply cut through the red tape as you say and decide according to preference who you are, allows you to take the process that you already use to create your own reality and shift it as you say on a dime or any denomination you choose. Therefore be mindful should you choose the idea of beginning to express joy and ecstasy in your life not so much of who you are being that is not the person you desire to be but who you do desire to be who you prefer to be and therefore once you decide who you already are. Any person that you may have been in any other given moment becomes irrelevant to that decision. You become the person you decide in each and every given moment. Now if you decide what you are saying is nonsense you get it. If you decide that makes sense I'll give that a try then you get the partial result of someone who is trying. If you decide ah I already do that I will begin to do it consciously right now you are no longer any other person that you have ever defined yourself to be you are now the preferred you. If you will begin to simply trust that decision your actions perhaps subtly at first but eventually quite blatantly will begin to reflect the decision and the actions will have results and even what you consider to be the external circumstance will seem to change. Now understand in no uncertain terms because of the cause and effect methodology that you create in your reality through your actions you perform an action which you consider to be a cause and you get an effect. You have a tendency to judge yourself against the background of your circumstance of your situation. If you will begin to understand that all those results all those circumstances truly have no built in meaning that they are a neutral set of props no matter how they may appear on the surface you then give yourself the power to interpret that circumstance those situations through the you that you have now decided to be. Now if that you happens to be an empowered being you will say well how does this situation serve me exactly as it is and then get the result of service from a circumstance service from a situation that you have formally labeled negative or formally labeled as evidence that well I guess I haven't changed at all. Understand by the way that when you say I guess I haven't changed at all what are you doing you're making a new decision in the moment and though you did change completely in 100 percent that decision I haven't changed at all is very similar to perhaps you can say previous negative decisions that you have made and therefore can seem it is only an apparent but a very strong one seem to cancel out the positive change it does not for you are still a new being with that much more knowledge but the idea is only do you seem to backslide as you sometimes say when you are not willing to remind yourself remember yourself to maintain the decision of who you prefer to be and any circumstance that would seem to be negative seem to be evidence that you are not the new person that you desire to be is on the flip side of the coin an opportunity to re-establish to realign to who you prefer to be by reminding you ah though the circumstance may appear negative the me that I prefer to be no longer chooses to interpret it that way this is the new me and therefore my interpretation of any set of circumstance is new is a new and therefore I can derive how each and every circumstance is of service to me all the while as you adopt this approach and containing the idea of maintaining who you prefer to be and trusting that and acting that way you are creating a new set of circumstance and so the external situation in your life does seem to change but generally only if you are unwilling to use the first moment that you make the decision I am now this preferred person the consciousness of that preferred person to interpret your present set of circumstance which physically speaking may be resulting from older perspectives but the new interpretation completely changes the effect of the circumstance rather than perpetuates on and on and on and on so no matter what you are seeming repetitive issues have been they only appear to be repetitions because you adopt a similar approach a similar interpretation and ultimately a similar set of actions when you realize here it comes again allowing the decision of who you prefer to be to stick simply simply requires occasional reminders and that is also conducive to the changes the willingness to remind yourself to interpret your reality through your new self therefore the initial idea of experiencing what you call ascension is to express yourself in this life as this particular version of your consciousness fully purposely and being willing to not settle for anything less than getting every positive thing out of it that you can when you do this you experience the idea of ascended consciousness while still maintaining the appearance of a physical body and a linear expression and living your reality in a physical way as a conscious create or expressing yourself through preference and joy expressing the things that bring you passion with integrity for you know everything is one integrated whole is a type of experience that is perhaps I will say to be qualitative about it and mean this perhaps you can say a bit loosely an unrivaled experience in the multiverse therefore you would not want to miss it my particular society still expresses itself in a physical way we are perhaps you can say on the verge on the threshold of beginning the first phase of our non physical expression of consciousness but we have throughout our history and I use the term loosely because time has a different meaning for us still chosen to experience physicality though from the perspective of conscious creator from the perspective of taking the advantage of the unique opportunity to discover the unique opportunity to be surprised to experience unexpected circumstance which again I remind you when you are infinite all knowing that a parent he no longer has meaning not that you are missing anything in that state you are not but the way to create this type of experiences through gradient expression of your consciousness as opposed to holistic expression of your infinite consciousness before we proceed to the interaction allow me to simply remind you once again that you do as an infinite being already contained at all there is nothing outside infinity there is no border to infinity and therefore anything that you hear that you discover is literally literally that process it is not gaining something you never had and now do it is simply this covering opening up the cover the veil to more of who you already are and therefore should you feel you have learned something whether it is in this interaction or any other time in your life most accurately you are simply now choosing to express what you already contain and therefore you get the credit you get 100% credit for the creation of your reality because you 100% create that reality therefore by all means you can entertain the idea of being willing to be proud and take the credit that you are doing you already create your reality through decision trust and action therefore the only slight change that we perceive that you are now unveiling to yourself and therefore we act as a reflection is the simple idea to be more conscious about it to be more definite about it to make the decision to allow that decision to stick and then to have the fun of going around to your reality interpreting your reality through the decision and watching in what you call short span of time your entire realities life circumstances relationships to both yourself and what you perceive to be others change 100% only when you change your perspective your approach does there appear to be an external alteration of circumstance only when you change who you are does it appear that others have also changed or you are now willing and ready to interact with others on that level for they also each and every one of you also are multi dimension it infinite and eternal beings and contain every potential every possibility every expression and as you change the vibration for which you express your reality you also change the vibration through which you interpret it and therefore are now literally interacting with a different version different aspect of any individual that you formally have interacted with and they seem to have changed but ultimately it is you and change is the only constant anyway or one of them therefore I thank you for being willing to allow me to reflect back to you what you already know to be true for yourself what you now have chosen as your timing and allowing me to act as the reflection to mirror back certain very simple ideas remember though your reality may seem to contain the notion of complexity the mechanism through which you create your reality is quite simple and when you define who you are you can now allow for the dispensation of your reality to be simple to be effortless effortless does not mean you will not have surprise you will not have unexpected ideas you will not perceive the idea you sometimes refer to as challenge but effortless is simply an expression of no longer going against the grain of who you know yourself to be effort in one interpretation of that term is simply going against your own grain causing a friction causing a resistance which seems to exhaust you all being who you are is quite simple and quite effortless therefore I thank you once again and for the first time since I am creating myself anew also I am always experiencing each and every one of you as a new being and myself as a new being as well nice to meet you all shitting and who you it's nice to have you in my backyard for a change oh right and you as well when you talk about as we change and experience our self experience a different aspect of ourselves and then interact with other people we are experiencing a different aspect of them that clarifies things for me very well into how I can understand that of parent change in people oh right well one tendency that we have noticed is individual say well I could change I know I could if only she would change and in fact they have it backwards I have experienced that myself I appreciate that particular wording that helps me understand it better oh when you say that we all contain everything we contain all the experience that we can experience a linear process does each one of us contain the same set of experiences well in a sense again we are talking gradations levels of totality as ironic as that term actually is it is all one one ID as we refer to it all that is leaves nothing out and again one way to look at it is that it is all the same one all that is containing every single myriad and nuance of possible experience imaginable and a few that are unimaginable so yes but as you begin to experience yourself in a gradient as seeming removed from that totality each one of you creates the simultaneous apparent see the entire reality is merging into me and even though that seems paradoxical that there be more than one focal point that the reality seems to emerge into nevertheless that is the way it expresses itself that is a paradox an infinite idea being perceived through finite means in discussing in this way we will discuss the notion as everything that we experience as a consensus that other people are are willing to share that same experience the same physicality or the same view of reality that we are sharing otherwise we wouldn't they wouldn't be in our reality is that what you're saying that is one way to experience it but ultimately your entire experience each and every one of you hinges on your decision in the moment and so your experience of that consensus can drastically alter in any given moment. Oh if there is a question please ask. Your question later on in the interaction. Well we would have gotten around to you anyway. I thank you. I thank you for your attention. Don't be shy. There are as many ascension processes as there are perceptions as well. Is that correct? Well again anything that you can imagine is true on some level of reality and the idea of infinite simply means there is no women so that would apply to experiences of attending. Yes. Now our general approach is to highlight the most self-empowered version of any idea that we are discussing. The version that allows you to be that person with no one else's help and again I remind you continually that you already contain it all because should you decide to ascribe a credit to me I will not accept it. I am simply acting as a mirror to what you already know. Does that answer the question? Yes. Are you sure? Not really. I'm working with the group right now that is working with a process called the awakening process. Oh. Describe. Leaving the bed and moving into a dimensional reality and extending and actually leaving a three dimension moving into that a fourth. Now with the idea of leaving the third for good. Temporarily. Oh. To experience more of the self. Correct. More. And bring that back to this particular reality. After a four day transformational state. Oh. Four day. Oh. And moving back into our third dimension to continue on with a two week process of a physical transformation based on the cellular change. Oh. Well that is one way to express it. Again on a gradient with the process but ultimately understanding no uncertain terms what we have already shared which is this after your certain amount of days and certain amount of weeks. Any change that you experience will truly now the most accurate way to put it is to say that it will result from the decision in that moment and not truly from the process from now till then. So certainly that is one way one method to express the idea but allow me to also share something else to clarify something else that we mentioned which is that your body exists within your consciousness. Individuals will sometimes assume well my consciousness cannot shift until my body shifts. Until it evolves till it changes. The cellular structure, the expression of its DNA and so forth. And this is very creative, very useful. Individuals will use that as a pivot but perhaps you can say the interesting point about it is that mechanically speaking no matter what the body does not change first. Always is there a shift in the consciousness which again I remind you from one way of looking at it the body. Any change that would seem to occur in the body on a cellular level without exception always was caused by an initiation first by a change in consciousness. So if an elaborate process is what you feel you require to shift your consciousness no matter what that process is no matter what degree of complexity it contains to allow you to say well I did something I can now expect a result. The change always first comes in consciousness. Does that make sense? Yes it does but one does not require outside assistance for that as an extension process. Simply not although one can attract that form of it if they wish. All options are valid. All approaches are absolutely equally valid and we are not discussing our particular point of view to invalidate any other approach but simply to simplify the idea simply to define what many of these approaches actually accomplish in a kernel, in a crystal that's right in front of you and again not to invalidate the process. So there are an infinite number of processes that an individual or individuals can create but the point of what I am saying is that it ultimately results in a given moment in your decision I am now ascended I am now transformed and it is the decision in that moment that results in cellular change that results in any type of physical change that you experience and not actually the process and ironically paradoxically when you make that decision when you be that person whether you use the process add a rationalization or not ironically you will immediately realize what I am saying. Well one of the first ideas of ascending or being willing to express yourself in a more limitless way is ah it wasn't the process it was me it was me all along. Does that make sense? Yes it does. So the energy that I feel at night about me are my own consciousness coming into work with my own vibration? Absolutely. Even the idea of what you call spirit guide or any external manifestation literally exists within you. Now you can perceive them as other beings to allow you to experience very specific nuances of your consciousness and by all means through the physical expression it is quite a valid idea of assigning this is this guide this is this consciousness this is this energy but what you have said is truly most accurate it is all you. Well it is up to you I will suggest that when you experience that you will say it slightly differently you will take that question mark straighten it out to an exclamation point. Because you will simply in making that decision be quite definite about it and on swerve as you say rather than saying well I can get it all you will say I created all do you wish to do this? That is the question. Ah only you can answer that. I can take a stab at it. I can perceive that yes you wish to do it but there is some hesitation some trepidation some fear what is it that you feel could be a negative result of simply taking back your power in creating your life consciously. The fear would be drawing in unknown energies of unknown origins. Unknown. Unknown. So you could discover more of yourself yes. Since we are all part of one yes. And then perhaps you may revise or consider I will never insist that you do any of it. I suggest that unknown origins no longer are relevant when you express that the reality exists within you. There is no outside there is no origin which is not you. Do you assume that you would intend to harm frighten or have a negative result from yourself to yourself. Oh well what we are speaking of here is conscious intention no intention slipping in there when you make the decision this is your intention this is your clear intention. So you may now begin to realize that nothing can happen unintentionally unless your decision involves that particular allowance. I assume you wish to experience your transformation in a positive way. Yes. Then simply build that into your decision. One of the ideas is to be very specific about what that decision is and should something come along in your experience that will result in perhaps revising that decision be willing to use that feedback. But at least be willing to establish who you are from what seems to be available to make the decision about who you are from what seems to be available and automatically will you refine it. Thank you. Is this of the system. Oh wait is there still something that you are as you say in your vernacular hanging up on. I have to go along a little bit more I can come back a few more thank you. Please do and thank you as well. Shitting. I would like to welcome you tonight. Thank you and thank all of each and everyone. Wonderful having you. Oh right. It's wonderful to be here as well. I'm not sure if this is going to make sense but if everything that you said to us and then most everything is something I'm sure everyone here had pretty clear idea about. Then if we are microcosm of the whole why isn't Mother Earth just making a decision to change. Well is she going to a process like we are. Well your question contains the answer. For though I have introduced the idea of spontaneous redefinition changing your entire reality perhaps you have not quite made that decision yet. But when I say that you will begin to see external reflections across the board that will include your planet which is also a consciousness. And again not apart from your consciousness within your consciousness. So should you now decide to shift to you are and perhaps experience a temporal lag in your circumstances giving you the opportunity to redefine those circumstances from who you now are. Once you allow that for what you call a period of time and how you still relate to and create time you will see the changes you are talking about. But the indecision does truly come from each and every one of you and you are also assuming that Mother Earth as you have put it is taking her time my particular observation is that the consciousness that you call your planet is right there ready and responding perfectly in every given moment is there something specific to which you are referring. Well part of this change has to do with healing I believe. Does your decision create a gradient whereby perhaps individual is unwell will obtain healing and then be well or can you understand that healing as this easy is also a decision made in a given moment. In other words your question implies a process implies stretching out the result from the decision and therefore your experience is the earth doing the same thing. Therefore your willingness to simply be whole which automatically includes the idea of helpful then allow your perception of the perfect response of what you perceive to be earth consciousness to shift to see that the earth is already doing. If this does not make sense please continue. No it makes no sense. Oh right you do not sound that thrilled about it. I assume perhaps I am out of line I assume that once you grasp the idea of your empowerment being right at your immediate disposal that you might just be a little bit excited. You want this transformation that's not for now. No need to be sorry. The transformation that is taking place in third to that of fourth the way I understand it where I have read is that of a galactic human can you stand on that. Well that is simply one way to look at when you are less contracted as an individual and become more expanded in your expression you shift your reality completely there seems to now suddenly be a mass expansion as well. And when you are slightly more willing to consistently be responsible for your actions, not blaming, but able to respond in a self-empowered way, you will be more alike any quote-unquote extraterrestrial life that would quote-unquote make it this far. When you are being a particular way, you attract other individuals with a similar exploration, whether it is the same or opposite, you attract the support to completely explore that idea. What you refer to generally as extraterrestrial consciousness is far more willing to honor your sovereignty as an individual than any of your media is giving it credit for. Therefore, the idea of interference whereby an extraterrestrial would present themselves in such a way where they would seem to be lifting up a less powerful being, where they would seem to be assisting a being who could not do it themselves. That notion runs contrary to the consciousness of the extraterrestrial, or perhaps in this case, galactic community. So therefore, once you walk your talk, once you are responsible for your reality, once you place the invitation out of a desire for mutual co-creation and enjoyment and exploration, you will very quickly see evidence of a galactic community, and then therefore, by extension, understand yourself not to be accepted into that community, but that you already are a part and an expression of that community, and always were. And simply were being honored as you created a contracted process by that community. Does that address the point? Yes. So the galactic community, now forming on the surface in terms of consciousness, will there be or how many races will there be here on Earth? Do you mean from other points, other than your Earth? Yes, many. I will not put a particular number on it, but perhaps you may understand there are many thousands of different civilizations, many of which are able to interact with your society, though it may seem at first to be just what you refer to as two or three. Again, the most likely idea is there will be one particular society that you will become aware of first, simply because you still create a linear idea. But your future is not etched in stone. The decision you make in any now moment determines from the infinite number of probable futures which particular idea you will experience. It's the most likely to form here. First would be that of human looking forms, that correct? There are two particular ideas. One is somewhat human looking. One is not. But I prefer for specific reasons not to be any more specific than that. It will depend upon, this is a play on words, but it is quite accurate, how alien you perceive that they will be, and how alien you perceive your own consciousness to be rather than comfortable and familiar. My perception is there will be many, and it won't be of all human form. But I don't perception. That is my perception as well. Well, thank you. I have done nothing. I'm chilling. Hey. I wanted to talk a little bit about health. Oh, what? I think the manifesting of this is. This is why, if you wish. So I just do this thing out for months and months and months and months and I'd like to make it, you know, something that would be of general interest, but it's pretty specific. Well, the idea is that your sinus cavity is very, shall I say, sensitive to electromagnetic changes other than just ragweed because of a particular substance in your sinus is known as magnetite, which is in that sense part of your sense of spatial orientation. So the idea is that you may now be more sensitive to any changes that are occurring. However, you need not experience the sensation of these changes in negative terms. So you can now introduce the idea to yourself of allowing yourself to be aware of changes without resisting those changes and causing friction and pain. Now, that is the more general idea. The other idea is to not allow any particular event, pain, discomfort to alter your decision. I assume when defining yourself, your definition, your decision includes feeling physically well. Yes. Always. That's definitely true. So when you maintain that decision, any particular sensitivity is very short-lived. When you use that friction, that discomfort, as evidence to create the decision, well, I now must be sick, then you actually perpetuate a process which is generally rather fleeting if you notice it at all. So to keep on subject, so to speak, reestablish and maintain the decision of who you are very specifically. To include the idea of I am not sick, but that I am well. Not running from what you don't prefer, but simply being what you do. And this is why we had said earlier that although you can, you need not establish who it is you are being that you no longer prefer in order to be the new you. I don't have to go lie am I creating this? And I don't have to go through that process. Just decide that I am healthy. Absolutely. And you may wish to even be more specific than that, because if the decision specifically reflects who you are and what you wish to do, you will be so busy that the seeming, shall I say, recovery period will simply be immediate, automatic, and you will forget all about it. Well, what did I get? Instead of simply I am healthy, have the decision be completely who you are. I am this person who enjoys this who expresses that. And in willing to be that whole person, there is no fragmentation or dis-ease in the process. And you become busy being that person, rather than sitting around and feeling your sciences. Does that make sense? Maybe watching me have some. What? Your privacy is completely intact. I mean, I'm sitting around. No, I just see that. By the way, one other idea. If you are sensitive to electromagnetic changes and are physically static, you do give yourself more opportunity to perceive that sensitivity in a negative way. If you are moving about, you are allowing the sensitivity, you are allowing the energy to move through you, rather than well up in that sense of the world. Notice that if I was physically active, that it was so definitely a belief. Oh, then to use your language liberally. See you later. OK. LAUGHTER What actually? Oh, I am. I am breathing in love. Well, you have changed your decision. And you have demonstrated in no uncertain terms that you get that decision. And I thank you. At this timing, we will pause for a short break of approximately 10 to 15 minutes of counting of your time and resume contact at that timing.
