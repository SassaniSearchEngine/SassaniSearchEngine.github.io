 Welcome and greetings this evening of your time as you create time to exist and believe me you do. Allow me to begin this interaction by entitlements, desire and allowance. Very appropone for we discuss many different perspectives with you and we always remind you that you create your own reality and that we co-create realities together. We co-create common experience but it boils down on your end to the creation of your own reality and no matter what effect you create within it, no matter how it may seem in the creation of any particular effect that that is something happening to you, that is the degree of your power and that is an appearance. For everything that happens from you. Now shall I say the mechanics of how you create are very neatly packaged into tonight's type for the idea is desire is one aspect of in that sense grounding yourself to who you know yourself to be. It is in that sense an expression of shall I say your own particular discernment and expression of what you sometimes refer to as your own particular case and in that sense allowing yourself to honor the things the nuances that stand out in your consciousness and begin to move upon these messages, upon these desires. And again conveniently, secondly is the idea of allowance and there may be again the appearance that in your life to create when you begin to look at doing so consciously that there is a great deal of diligence and effort required in order to create your reality according to preference which is the exploration you are now viewing but paradoxically allowing, allowing your reality to unfold is truly the only way to have it in that sense go your way, so to speak, or the idea is your reality always changes and through allowance you can allow those changes to deliver many things through resistance you slow down your own process. So as an overview that will do and we will begin with the idea you call dishonor. Now we have discussed many times that your reality is created through your actions and that the foundation of creating those actions and therefore the foundation for creating your reality are your beliefs, emotions and thoughts. Now when we speak of desire we are not speaking of the connotation that your society sometimes places upon that term of meaning a need or any nuance of the idea that you are not inherently incomplete and that something external can make you complete that form of desire that desire of need out of incompleteness is not what we refer to and will generally be accompanied by what you call great anxiety so it is not even generally the same feeling itself. There is again an avoidance aspect of desire that is not what we are discussing. What we are discussing is that nuance of an emotion within you that allows you to know in a given moment from what is in front of you as either an experience or an option that one of those ideas emotionally stands out as a desire. Therefore again part of what you would refer to as your excitement would be expressed through the emotionality you call desire. So beginning to allow yourself to get in touch with what you truly desire and feeling that desire is actually step one four. The allowance of that feeling remembering that it is an alignment to who you are allows you to key in on who you are in that moment. Now for a moment to simply make the point if you will all close your eyes. Simply now picture yourself in whatever scenario you find most comfortable. Do not be concerned about detail do not in that sense assess your ability to imagine. Simply in that way create any pleasant scene in your mind through which there are things around you that intrigue you and allow yourself to feel the desire that arises from in that sense those options. Create whatever scenario in your mind that you find the doing of simply because perhaps it is something you've always wished you or simply because just because and allow yourself to feel as your imagination provides whatever specific scene that it does and that will vary completely to all of you. Allow yourself to feel that desire to see the thing whatever it is whatever that represents in your imagination and feel the desire just prior to interacting with it. Allow it to come in whatever form it does and should perhaps one or two of you find nothing is coming continue to simply call up comes are up in your imagination something you find most enjoyable that you are about to do. Allow yourself to simply feel desire without anxiety the simple emotional expression of the desire. Oh well now open your eyes. Understand if you allow yourself to participate in that co-creation that is fine if not some time during what you call this evening this interaction you will feel desire and simply what we are doing is initiating or keying you into that sense of desire. So now you can very very shall I say it's simply keep your eyes ears and so forth out for that idea for what moves you literally moves you. Does that design and understand that we sometimes refer to emotions emotion as energy motion and what emotions actually do is take from the mental plane what you call your belief and activated into your physical reality emotions are activating mechanisms themselves. So when you feel that desire not only is it the sign perhaps you can say from your higher consciousness from your higher self whatever you wish to call it that the thing that you are desirous of is most representative of who you are but it also set into motion a propensity a tendency toward the manifestation of that very thing and that is something that you are simply not. So when you move into action having honored having experienced that desire you actually have what you refer to colloquially as a head start for energetically it turns a key within your reality and then makes it that much easier to act but not by denying your desire by allowing yourself to feel that desire and to perhaps again revel in that feeling because once again it is an expression in the circumstances in the specific events it is a direct expression of all you are it is presenting itself to you and simultaneously activating its potential activating its tendency to allow you to them midwife it into your reality. So therefore desire sets up a foundation it sets up an alignment and it sets up an activation and desire is a very strong positively oriented emotion again when you are functioning out of a sense of completeness not means that is an entirely different idea. Once you key in on the thing that truly moves you again energy motion it moves your reality in the direction to allow you to manifest that thing most effortlessly all that is paradoxically required aside from whatever action that you can take is part two a wow for the idea is when you change a belief when you change who you are fundamentally primarily because you are in a physical universe containing linear time some of the symbols that may have been representative of the old outdated idea still have not played out in your present time. Now if you interpret them when they come around that here they come again you lock yourself into the old belief pattern and results of the old belief but if you understand look at this on the surface it seems like the same old reality but I know through my desire and alignment that that is no longer representative of who I am you then can allow that symbol to deliver a different message allowing a symbol to deliver the message according to the old belief yield the quote unquote old negative result realizing that you have changed obviously because you decide to and allowing yourself to see how it has changed even old seeming symbols gives the seemingly again old symbols new meaning and thereby new effect so the allowance once again once you have had a desire or desire to make a change of allowing your reality to be what it already is rather than plugging in a definition that it should be something else that is one expression of allowing your reality to deliver to the new you perhaps again seemingly situations with an old sense but that now have a completely new significant and if you are the new you that you choose to be you will look for the new significance you will look for the difference not the similarity if you are looking for the similarities in the moment you are doing so you are doing so from the old perspective so allowing your reality to be what it is and then acting or moving through that reality with a desire to intend that it be something else allows the reality to change and again change is a universal constant therefore you do not have to make something change literally any making or forcing would make things appear to stay the same so change being the constant it is simply then not a matter of needing to impinge on the natural flow make force divert so much as it is to allow what is already there to serve you then it will change its face when you had an old belief and felt something did not belong in your reality you treated it that way and acted that way and created that effect but now you can choose to allow it to exercise your allowance and allow it to deliver its message when you find that something occurs in your reality which is on again the surface completely negative and perhaps reminiscent of something that you have already explored I again remind you that the new you will desire to look at it through different eyes because again when you receive the service from any thimble particularly those that you label repetitive and allow it to deliver its message then the messenger no longer has a reason to exist and anything that seems to repeat I again remind you is simply a message that you have not allowed yourself to get when you change who you are through your desire by allowing your reality to deliver whatever it is whatever you need to look at will come up you will not need to plan it or process through anything it will automatically and effortlessly come up and when it comes up allow the time that is the perfect timing and tells you that is the perfect moment for you to integrate that idea so allow your reality to be what it is not what you insist that it should be allow for your timing and again remember when you make or force or control and contract you then are not in the posture in that sense to be filled to receive allowing is the loosening of that and opens you to a posture of receptivity it allows you to interpret your reality again through your desire through what you wish to explore allowing the things that perhaps you may have deemed you need to explore to simply come up when they do and allowing that timing to be absolutely perfect so paradoxically you do not create your reality by making anything happen it is literally as though your reality was a great river rushing many hundreds of miles an hour with turbulent waters in a particular direction and you may in that sense weighed into the middle of that stream and attempts in that sense to have your reality conform to your wishes by in that sense blocking the flow but you will very quickly find you are carried downstream anyway by simply allowing the flow and understanding that the turbulence and speed of that flow is the exact perfect expression of what will get you exactly where you wish to be and allowing yourself to simply dive into that stream you will then be carried to the nearest shore upon which is then the circumstance and opportunity that will allow you to do anything you say you wish to do and if you contain any beliefs which are contrary to the manifestation of the things that you desire through your allowance and your say so it will come up in the form of any motion in the form of an action in the form of a mode of thinking but that then hands you back the power to trace well if I am acting in this particular way perhaps negative thinking in this particular way perhaps negative feeling this particular way perhaps negative what must I be leaving and if you are willing to be that much of an owner in your reality in every given moment again the contradictory beliefs that you feel are subconsciously stored in themselves to you upon a silver platter and perfect so when you allow this to occur your reality again power doctorically moves the faster and displays what you call extreme acceleration and the old symbols the symbols that are perhaps again more representative of an older style of thinking will play out and as you reassign them you will allow them to transform when you deny them I remind you you put them back they get in line and when they get to the front of the line they are quite angry but when you revel in the timing when you take it to the opposite extreme and rather than saying oh no here comes a belief I don't prefer I'm going to have to face it oh no you can always remember that when it is presented to you it becomes a gift for when you own a belief you can then choose a new belief because that equalizes it to all other beliefs when you deny it back in the closet close so the timing and the allowance of that timing once you have decided to allow your desires to be acted upon with integrity integrity does not in that sense become elusive in this process whenever we speak of acting on excitement whenever we speak on acting from desire we always mean that those actions include your full integrity if by the way you find that your actions are out of your integrity by your own standards you will allow yourself to see that in no uncertain terms as well so do understand that there is no escaping your for where will you go anywhere you hide is merely a fabrication within you any door you create is made of you any place you retreat is into yourself there is truly no outside and because everything exists within you though perhaps some things will have more likelihood to occur in a particular reality it is simply literally a matter of a while way from the pool of experience the things that you desire to stand out to through that desire be activated and through the allowance of your reality be delivered to you through experience and through your choice acted upon with integrity this truly boils much of what we have spoken down to in yet another perspective to that nucleus of thinking and we will find I am sure many other ingenious ways to say this embellishing many different ideas within but the bottom line for those of you who are not new to these interactions is still allowing yourself to be activated by what excites you and acting upon the opportunity in the moment that excites you with integrity the allowance then just becomes automatic for again anything that will come up will and your willingness to act and use those reflections in a positive way as service will allow them to transform out of your life completely and if they are things that you desire will magnify and intensify the effect that you get from them so when a belief comes up that you no longer prefer rather than oh no thank you thank you how fast your reality always has is all of us allow me to once again thank you your willingness to participate with us is a manifestation of your willingness to begin to allow yourself to meet your self perhaps again colloquially what you have here to fall referred to as the more alien portions of yourself but nevertheless fill within yourself this brings us great joy we also discover many things from your interactions and many times it will be the simplest smallest thing that one will share with us that will be of the most benefit you are an ingenious society absolutely mastering your phase of reality that phase of reality is no longer merely confined to separation and limitation so though you are the masters of those you are now mastering transformation and now are firmly standing perhaps you can say loosely speaking with one foot in each door or one foot in each room but remember you are both rooms and nothing is outside for this willingness to open up to who you are and share that expression with us I thank you I thank you for you honor me with this and once again open up this interaction for exchange setting the timing of this topic of course purpose a few issues that have to clear up on it one and when you're allowing how how do you not miss on taking action well again allowance is an overall orientation it is not the entire shall I say emphasis allowing your reality to be what it is will include the idea of then acting on the opportunity that you have allowed yourself to thank you for the distinction and this is one of the reasons we request clarification in these more intense important does that help well yeah I just see that you know a lot of times people don't wait around for the safe to fall upon their right don't see the opportunities that are all around them well allowing your reality to be what it is includes opening your eyes very wide and seeing what it is and in terms of limiting belief this week did that I you are by no means alone yeah that's my next question but anyway we went through this whole negative thing and a lot of times you know it always boils down to the deserved ability when it's related to the desire do you deserve oh that out of the way pretty easy but by allowing it I cycle through it so fast that it's just you know just one way well thank you for making another point and that is the allowance of your negative emotion now or whatever you are perceiving as negative experience of anytime cutting it off back into the closet allowing it to play out then gives you the opportunity to glean messages and then generally also provide some opportunity for action yeah and then it became like funny because oh my god at the end of it I just started laughing I'm like how does this serve me well you are centered and from that centered state now you will act upon what is available when you lament over what is not available you are still doing something well I'm projecting a negative form that but another way to look at it if you've already done that why bother to do it again okay the other question was with actually Jim now is because from our but it's a good question they're all good it's about momentum when you know group of this side is given a topic if there momentum behind everyone's kind of thinking on it and that's played more into our life because of that our own particular perspective would not be to use the terminology momentum so much as concentrated and organized focus so the idea is that it comes up that is to your awareness as your reality moves on if you are so inclined perhaps you will then see I have desires or whatever the particular subject is so it may bring itself to your awareness from time to time but again more from the idea of an agreement of focus than a momentum momentum is completely illusion of you create what you perceive to be momentum and perpetuate the recreation of it in each moment so it is an apparent see of having its own life but since in any moment you can see to continue to create that momentum that if any moves for the idea of momentum would not allow you to immediately stop it there would be what you call some after movement so then with that meaning that having a group of this side concentrate on that wouldn't facilitate it well yes it would but I would not refer to that as momentum simply concentrated focus so that would though in point make it easier but do understand that I do not prepare what I say to you and in fact have no idea what I am going to say until I say it for it is completely irrelevant until I say to me I do not honor the head of talk that's all thanks a lot well that is not quite old are you reconciled with the terminology we were utilizing in the last interaction was it finally explained perhaps with the analogy of a car coming by splashing you every time you kick that car you will hurt your foot that does not mean that it is the same situation you are always a different person but similar actions can be in that sense under a 50 yield similar results is that clarifying we wish that yeah it is did you hear that analogy at the last interact yeah I heard it it took me a while thinking on it to on my own oh if any idea comes up in this regard please share full we wish in that sense for full clarity all right okay hey sudden nice hi listen um this is a great topic for me I've been thinking since the last interaction I've been thinking about the topic and has focused in my life and I have a very strong desire in my life what I want to create and since I have this desire and vision in a relationship all my limiting beliefs have been coming up well what I've been saying that and some of them feel so painful I believe I'm interpreting it negatively well do you understand that you have the strength to feel the most painful one of them and not only do you have the strength to feel it but completely glean from it completely understand where it comes from and thereby through acknowledgement and allowance completely transforming I have been doing that you have a fear though that there is something within you that in that sense can overcome you and before you answer I proceed that you do now analytically does it truly make sense for creation to hand you anything that you couldn't handle another way to ask that is does it make sense that extraneous things would creep into your life or creation itself oh so are you willing to perhaps acknowledge that perhaps because you are feeling that in and of itself as we had discussed with the desire is enough to tell you you can handle it oh yeah but no I understand but what I bring with you is some very deep truth in myself well how exciting the deeper truth that you root out and the deeper truth that you weed out that no longer apply to you be larger grand or sweeping changes than occur as a reflection in your mind so one way to look at it is oh no I'm at the bottom of the battle and another way to look at it oh sure I'm at the end of the way I need to take a thing to this person of what my truth is in a particular situation well in many of the discussions that we have had with you in particular and many of you when you do that thing then your reality provides the circumstance to allow you to continue to flow where you hang up is in pondering decided thinking running it over and over the paralysis of analysis well you do not have to do anything but if you take the action as in many of the other times that you have first of all the results will not be what you expect and second of all you will then allow your reality allow your reality to deliver the feedback to either keep you in that direction or point you in the straighter direction to your path so the avoidance in and of itself is the only thing hanging you up that is one of the ideas but again when I spoke of happy swimming in the sea of your beliefs that will generally be in that sense preceded by a dive into that sea so have the open posture of allowance to know I am ready to allow my reality to deliver the vestiges of my obsolete feelings and get excited about and in fact if you wish to simply cut through much of this allow what you perceive to be the worst come up after you handle that and show yourself in the uncertain terms how simple it is everything else will fail in context so perhaps in a sense you can use the reflection of the intensity of that degree of negativity as a reflection for the degree of strength that you have if this is a practical sense it is as you say as simple as one of your phone calls is it not do you wish in that sense that I give you the dime or will you move by yourself oh we have no money how convenient thank you thank yourself you are creating your life closely and have now injected the shall I say concept and preference and are beginning to get the feedback that that works as well thank for your great share first of all I want to thank you for the private session I had it's had a tremendous impact they will allow me to thank you for the one that you gave me and now along the lines that you're just talking about who is let's see pretty deep I I believe that I am allowing myself to see reality I mean shift in your perspective a slight shift but as we have said it has made a grand change now the change will not only be in your ability to act in your reality but also in your perception as now you are seeing through the new beliefs which are less limiting and more empowered specifically though there's a situation I'm going through and I believe things are coming up because I am in a position to really a more empowered position to look at things that are terrifying to me and they're coming up oh and I guess I just like some I feel your support when I'm when I'm it has to do with a massage and some terrifying things that happen to me when I'm going through it and I don't know what it is and I feel like something is pushing me to every time I go through it there's a relief and there's a freedom but I feel like it's a bottomless pit oh no no no no no no perhaps the terror is that it is a bottomless pit it is not but the idea is that you are delivering to yourself as was mentioned your own reflection of your ability to deal with it you are fully ready now to deal with this idea but I remind you no matter what you find which whether it is an experience or a concept has no effect on you until you match it in agreement in the moment it has again no momentum it is recreated and that may make it seem like it carries a momentum but in any moment you can simply choose all right I feel this terror find a place a comfortable place wherever it may be whatever is convenient and feel it created imbue it ask yourself wait a minute this is the most terror I have ever felt can I feel more and allow yourself allow allow yourself your emotion then ask while you are feeling it not later in a hypothetical situation what must I believe what is coming to me what do I perceive as happened or whatever and something will come up now if it is something that is from this life or well and good if it is something that would appear to be from a past life or well and good but understand that regardless of what the ultimate label winds up being it only exists now because you recreate without addressing it without acknowledging it and only are you prepared to own that degree of yourself understanding that that is the bottom of the past and once you do there is no longer a bottom the barrel no longer feels for you no longer deny who you are and denial always has filled that barrel and acknowledgement has always allowed it to pour empty but is that practical yeah kind of like this is the ultimate fear of mine so when I can allow it and then I will get through it it is proportionally related to the amount of benefit that you will receive so if it is the ultimate fear then it brings with it the ultimate rule and that is why I am pursuing it that is why even though you may create what you call anxiety or nervous you can understand if you conceptually grasp what I am saying that there is some excitement there in anticipation of the fact that what you are doing is transforming your most living so the very thing that most of you fear the most no matter what that is brings along with it your greatest liberation if you are willing to face it rather than deny it. So some of the feedback you know I get is why bother doing this while you are doing this but my trust in myself is something I need to do to get free well the freedom will simply be when in the moment you decide enough is enough it says done what it has in a sense been created to do I understand the message and I simply no longer choose to experience that then would require you allowing your reality to be that way and treating and interacting with it through that allowance but I can only say that when I am feeling the intense fear right I mean if I say it now okay I allow this you know to serve me and I hear it and it is that is not what you are talking about. Well the point is that when you feel it is part of the point not only that you feel it the timing of feeling it is always for any of you whether you choose to take the opportunity and use it or not it is always telling you right now if you want to you can transform it by its mere presence in that moment and nothing else. So to get really specific if I am shaking and feel you know this terror I can at that point say but I have to really feel it. I do not hold a bit of it back that one bit that you hold back is the embodiment of the remaining denial so perhaps I will be liberal with your language freak out do whatever you are but do not hold back and when you get to the point where it kind of feels like now what will not simply keep pouring out it is not a bottomless barrel and this is one of the things that will allow you to see that it is not a bottomless barrel when you allow yourself to feel that you do get to the point of all right now what the now what stage is where you can question what must I believe to have created and you can then add what must I now believe about myself to think little pat on the back never hurts it is something else comes up to share again that last thing you said what do I have to believe now well I thought it was shedding but all one and who you said a minute ago that what do I have to think now to allow that feeling to come up yes repeated once again there appears to be in context in the last yes in the last interaction with the young lady understood the last thing you said what do I have to what do I have to believe now that I am looking at that before it is this when you are willing to begin to look at the least that you have avoided the mere fact that you are looking at them is an expression of the fact that you now believe you can handle it so pat yourself on the back though you will express some limiting beliefs you are also beginning to express empowering the least as well so the mere fact that you are willing to look at it is the expression that you now believe you can handle it and when you avoid it it is the expression that you believe that you cannot and back into the closet does it go? Thank you. Oh thank you. Shut it. Hey. No. Two questions. Oh what? Number one. First one I think is easy. When you refer before to the word yourself and you say it is not escape yourself does that mean the physical aspect of ourselves? No. God knows. You know way does it mean the physical and in fact you can shift your emphasis or point of view from the physical so far that you perceive that you are out of your own body. What I mean is what you would refer to as colloquially the I am within each and every one of you. What we sometimes refer to as your signature vibration again because change is the only constant and your face your appearance your attitude your beliefs change the only thing that allows you to identify you as the same you is the I am is your own signature vibration. Does that trend? Not really. Oh. I am. Are you in any way physically similar to as you say the way that you are in the way that you were when you were born. Do you think the same way? Do you carry yourself the same way? What allows you to know that you are the same person? Now before you answer the answer to that question is the answer to your question. That is what I mean by yourself. It is the infinite and eternal yet multi dimensional portion of your soul or over soul or higher self is one way to look. If this is not clear please continue to ask. I understand what you are saying but basically saying how perceptions all emanate from the I am vibration therefore we can't go anywhere. Thanks. In any way in this physical universe which is what we are discussing that you choose to express yourself where you hide pieces of yourself from other people in what you colloquially call subconscious. You may understand in that way one moment. The beliefs that you create will always make themselves obvious in your reality. So therefore you cannot escape who you are or who you are expressing yourself. Ah perhaps another way to refer to this is you cannot escape what you truly believe for it will always in some way make itself obvious if you will in that sense deny that belief and put it back hide it from another portion of yourself. It will still again get in line get to the front and will present itself to you. So never can you escape the beliefs within you is that clear. Second question. Number two. The two previous discussion. At least I think it refers to. When we experience emotions such as anguish anger pain sadness. Are those emotions manifestations of non allowance? They are the manifestations of the lease which are generally limiting the lease. So sadness or what you call green would be an emotion that would in that sense only result if you had the belief that you could lose something to begin anger is a little bit different for anger is an emotion of alignment anger allows you to see in any given moment this is who I am and this is absolutely who I am not. So therefore it allows you to define yourself through differences where individuals then usually will allow it to beg your date is to what you then call invalidation and judgment for the thing that has just shown them this is not me. So anger in a sense would be a little bit different. Was there something else you were inquiring about. So further this. If one is experiencing these emotions but chooses not to follow the desire and allowance as you go. Well the idea is to allow yourself to glean what you believe to be feeling and if you are willing to hold acknowledge that belief and change it the new belief will have emotions that will replace the old if though you deny that belief once you have traced it again perhaps you will continue to create so to answer your question directly allow yourself to feel the feeling then allow yourself to plug in specifically in that situation specifically in that moment what you must be leave to feel that then look at the belief I do believe that that is a limiting belief now you can begin to talk about changing or alternative beliefs because you have brought to your conscious awareness the limiting belief. Okay thank you. Is that usable or more confusing. It's complicated but using it. Well it is really quite simple as you glean what you believe from an emotion and you decide I wish to keep that belief go right ahead if you once you acknowledge your belief decide you do not wish to have that belief you simply having acknowledged that old belief call forth the new belief allow your imagination to turn it the set of actions of how one with the new belief would act and then walk into the situation that you usually would have acted the old way and act the new way it will get a different result and your emotional feedback will then change it. Perhaps that makes it more confusing. Sometimes there's always something holding me back to the original belief. Little interesting idea of what could hold you back since everything is you. Oh wow. Now that you are holding you back it is simply a matter of ceasing to force and conform and letting go and allow you. Now that I know this is a concept now that this makes sense to me I will do this. Now once you trace through what I have just described experientially it will make a lot more sense to you or then a belief will come up that is relevant to that moment rather than the general outline that I am laying out for you then perhaps again you will see experientially that what I am saying makes sense. But it is at least concise and clear. And if not is there some question that you can formulate to clarify. I think I got it at this point. Well again if not check back in. Alright. Thank you. Over there. Hello. Griefing. This topic was a corporate for me tonight and then what I want to ask you about deals with initially a book that I just read by Alice Miller called The Drama of the Giffley Child which pointed out to me I think the source of belief systems that interfere with my creating a life of reference or seem to continue to end the what this book said was that a parent who for whatever reason sends signals to the child that certain portions of them are not acceptable to the mother then the child girls are feeling that only part of them is okay and I see that that feeling that I am in some way flawed or not okay or not good enough. It gets in the seems to be getting in the way well only when you for and again now that you have some insight into the mechanism this is not something stored in your cells that you're stuck with that is a perception and there is some accuracy to the mechanism that that involves however it is not the only explanation what I am saying is that each time you feel it by definition in that moment you are re-creating you are matching you are aware of an infinite number of things in your reality but they do not all evoke what you call a response from you when you have a response evoked you in that moment are matching that so you can always ground yourself back into that moment and ask yourself all right what am I perpetuating right now and generally we'll find an even asking yourself that three quarters if not all of those dewis no longer apply to them that is simply a matter of dialogue. Okay I do I think that I work really hard in trying to identify what the police are that don't serve me and often I'll bring them by the way I will not allow it to slip by that you have worked very hard at trying well do not apologize but the point is that is exactly what you are doing and in wording it that way continuing to word it that way you are reflecting to yourself I am still trying I am still not 100% diving in. So if I try do you mean when I say try it's like a belief that I can't succeed? So you are not even trying you are working you are trying you are one step removed from even trying so push that all aside and do it period it sounds like semantics sounds like a lion being a cosmic wise die again and you can interpret it that way if you wish but it is literal as well. Why reflects the belief that I can't succeed? Why reflects an incomplete commitment it reflects incomplete conviction therefore fully commit fully then act with full commitment and full commitment and that little light shift is the pump that you are cleaning. Well let me use an example. I am doing a consulting job right now this doesn't really excite me it's not really exactly what I want to do but I think I created it to give myself the means to give me time and money to do what I really like to do. Well while you are doing it are you also then keeping your eyes very open for other opportunities that come along or are you so engrossed in the process itself that they are passing you by? Well the process itself requires a lot of my time and attention. That is why I am asking. One of my fears is that that might happen and I don't want to I don't want to shut myself off for more exciting opportunities. Then state to the universe I remain completely open and do so and that is all. I assume that you then mean that there is a date set for the completion of the world. Then what will you do? Perhaps that is more the point. Oh yeah something more exciting. Okay well the understanding that you have chosen this situation and understanding that perhaps you have slightly sold yourself short of your excitement but you have entered agreement and you have in that sense exchanged integrity with other individuals. Are you willing to entertain the thought that within the foundation that you have laid down are some exciting things and begin to work within your structure of the things that do what you would say. There are many things that I could do that excite me but there are more specific things but I have a real sense that the way the world is changing now rapidly that it is almost like I want to look and understand the big picture more before I pick any specific area to get involved in like solar energy or something like that before I get perhaps involved in that I wanted to write something on the world economy integrating the concepts that you are talking about before I felt comfortable as to where I was feeling. Well that is one approach but the other approach is to simply say alright here are my options this one excites me and dives in and then the other ones because they are representative of who you are will become more available as you are acting on the things that do excite me. Again I remind you simply grounding yourself and from what is available even with this agreement that you have in place begin once again to factor in your excitement and not work on it or try to do that but simply do it. It has got a little more exciting as I got some positive feedback on it. Well as in that sense you honor what does excite you from what is available and will get much more exciting not just a little. Well the example that I wanted to use was I have the lots of times I have to work on this during the day and I feel when I sit down and start to work on it I start to get the belief that I am going to be rejected and that makes me want to eat cookies or watch these. Well in that moment that you are doing the working is there someone there evaluating you yes or no no therefore it is irrelevant to that moment and you are simply not reminding yourself of it you are hugely. I understand that and I really know what you are not understanding completely is that all you have to do and I again understand this sounds too simple to be true in stop. When you find yourself doing it acknowledge it remind yourself all right can someone evaluate this right now well obviously not then why am I thinking about what someone will think about this it is not relevant to what I am doing all right well I have this idea I entertained it I push it aside then you will be regrounded to what is available. I see how you know how you say that all the beliefs are equal and I know that I can choose to believe that I will be rejected and that I won't be rejected and I would work better if I believed I wouldn't get rejected but it seems that the belief that I will be rejected somehow is more powerful or more compelling and I was thinking perhaps because I had already experienced rejection that it somehow seemed like that belief was wrong or congratulations will you have just nailed it now is that what you prefer to continue to win by absolutely not but I will be getting away from it well if you understand the equality of all beliefs then you understand your equal access to acting according to either belief so what you are not perhaps doing is calling for the referential preferential in those circumstances. Well I have a heart when I try to visualize but I can visualize the preferential meaning that I want to be someone that loves myself stands in the moment looks around and loves what I create what I create and without feeling of reservation just you know diving in experience life but the way I visualize myself I find is that I feel incomplete or you are not in that sense expressing the mechanism that we are just going to use your example you are sitting there writing your report an idea occurs to you that in that moment you may be rejected and you begin in that sense to create what you call a paralysis then you remind yourself one moment this is not what I prefer I certainly don't prefer to go eat cookies either therefore who am I well right now I am being a person that acts hesitatingly because of the belief from rejection but ultimately what I am doing is stopping what I am doing I am hesitating now the referential preferential me have these characteristics that you have just so illustratively named what would that referential preferential me be doing sitting at the same desk having that same notion well it is entertaining the notion ah it is understanding that it has for that moment expressed the belief it is now formulating that it will if it were to express the new belief continue writing the report and continue writing the report you are assuming you do not have that much talent when you do that one single time you will have overcome much of what you always in that sense in different forms discuss with understanding you have complete power in the moment but the action is the ultimate expression nothing is stopping you from completing that report but notion and belief that you are handing it to things that I get overpowered by these feelings of rejection and I say ok I know I don't want to I want to work on this and I don't want to go turn on two beauty cookies right now then I get up and do it you know the cookies it's almost like well you are saying that I understand what I do not want to do and I will do that is also a choice that is also conscious creator but as well but set up in a way perhaps we are using it as an excuse to perhaps again deny that what you have set up does not exist. Okay well there is preferential preferential use not just as a notion but as a model for action is the true answer to your question or even demonstrating it to yourself but once you can in a sense seem to reverse attendance and show you yes I can write this report rather than watching television and eating the cookies and still feel fulfilled. So you are saying at the moment when I am feeling like I am going to get up and eat cookies but I don't want to call forth the preferential preferential use see what that you would do and do that. Call someone or something like that. Or take a walk or finish the report. Okay. The preferential preferential you might also determine that what this is telling me is that in this moment I need a break. Therefore my options are to watch TV and eat cookies to in that sense complete this report to call a friend to go for a walk well A and B do not excite me as much as I will call a friend. Ah I am done talking to the friend. Do I wish to do this report? Well here are my other options. None of them are very exciting. The report is actually the most exciting option. Your report is now done. But the point is to trust and allow your reality to be what it is. Not what it ought to do. I will do that. Can I use one more example? Regarding women. I really feel that at some point I would like to be married and have children. Why? Why? Because I love kids and I just I sense on some level that I would really enjoy being in partnership. You have something to share in that. Yeah. Yeah. I would like to enjoy life with her as a child. Good. The thing that blocks me though is when I try to visualize myself being married to someone I can sometimes see the preferential me feeling grounded and solid and letting life come from me choosing what I want and then sharing my life with someone as an equal partner. But a lot of times what I get afraid of or what stops me or the alternate vision that I often have is of me kind of standing there alone in the world and meeting someone to come and take care of me or completely some way almost like meeting another. Well those are the those are the beliefs with the as you have just stated it would be inaccurate to say you believe one or the other you believe both and believing one gives you one reality believing the other gives you another reality believing both gives you a third reality for you act both way. Ultimately you only get the effect of either belief when you are acting like you believe. So it is always in the moment to cease the continuance of those actions called for the preferential you and in certain new acts according to preface it would be inaccurate to say that I no longer contain the belief that I am needy you always contain all beliefs so knowing that you contain them all and they are all equal then allows you to see it is not a matter of getting rid of one belief and choosing another one but that by focusing on one the other is just simply now out of your experiential reality but it is not gone anywhere ultimately though what gives you the effect in your life is how you are acting so when you picture yourself standing alone understand in that moment you are acting like that person and if you will simply call up the preferred reality plug in those actions and begin to act that way you will then feel that. Like as soon as I visualize the weak me or the needy me I start putting myself down and say I have not done it wrong or you know well that is the weak and needy you doing that but in the next moment you can simply shift your focus to the empowered you and have a little conversation your preference factors into it there is no what in what unless you create that appearance. It seems like every time I hear the disapproving parents of voice in my head I put myself down and say oh you buy into it you buy into it. How do I get it's like it. First of all understand that you are buying into it. I am buying a bill of goods that in and of itself can shift the impact for it brings it back to you. If you are feeling that way you are buying into that and it is simply then a matter of realigning to preference do I prefer to feel this way no do I really only disapprove and dislike myself no. There are the other ways that I feel call them up bring them forth and then watch feeling that how the preferential you now act it hands you a new set of action the performance of the new set of action gives you new results and you no longer can say this keeps happening. You are a sponge you are absorbing and trust and begin to understand that you are power wise not in speculation not in preparation but in the moment that it occurs when you feel most helpless that is when you have the most power to change. Why do I continue to feel like the world is in a state form like it's not because you have not fully embraced what I am saying but now you are beginning to enter. When you feel the most vulnerable you are displaying the most strength and showing yourself that you can handle anything. So remind yourself of that when you do so while you are berating yourself you can talk to a couple of compliments. You may all enjoy a short time.
