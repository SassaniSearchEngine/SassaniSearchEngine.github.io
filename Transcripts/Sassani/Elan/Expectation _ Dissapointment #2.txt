 Allow me to say, before we continue, it was the day or night after Christmas. And everyone was stirring and having a good time. We had discussed briefly prior to your break the idea, and perhaps this is timely with your holiday or holy day, of the second coming. And discuss that this second coming, so to speak, would not occur through a single individual, though it may be expressed by single individuals, but would be the expression of that energy, the Christ energy, within each individual. Now allowing an expression in a more full way. Allow us, before proceeding, to shall we say define just a little bit more the idea of how this would present itself, and at the same time maintain complete and utter simplicity, for it really boils down to three overall ideas, which again have many branches and many shall we say offshoots. But basically, three ideas will embody the Christ within you, will allow you to know if you are acting from that particular aspect or center of your being. Number one will be unconditional love itself, for the Christ energy that we are discussing with you now, is unconditionally loving as it is a direct reflection of what you call God, of all that is, and all that is is the embodiment energy, so to speak, colloquially speaking, of unconditional love itself. So expressing that in your physical reality, through what you consider to be your personality, takes the form of being willing to express unconditionally, unconditional love. No conditions, I will love you, period. I may not particularly like what you are doing, but I will love you, I will understand you have the right and reason, I may not choose to interact with you, but I will not forsake you, for who you choose to be. Simply establish an alignment, I agree, I do not agree, and have it be all right either way. That is unconditional love. Again, this need not mean you condone a reality you do not prefer, but not condoning something simply takes the form of not acting that way, not embodying it, the utter condonement, so to speak, is being that way yourself, giving them all right, a dose of their own medicine, is being that same idea, and matching the thing you say you don't prefer, and acting that way. So your willingness to acknowledge and then simply choose the actions that correspond to your preference is unconditional love, in action, in effect. Number two is excitement itself, for the expression of your fullness and totality is the expression of your excitement, of your passion, of what moves you, of what brings you joy, and allows you to feel as though you are expressing yourself utterly according to preference. And so therefore, unconditionally loving, excitement, and the third shall we say idea is integrity, which links very strongly to the first idea of unconditional love. For integrity is the complete, the complete willingness to acknowledge the integration of all things, the integrity, the integral connection and interwovenness of all creation. It is all within you, even the ideas you say you don't prefer, must be within you, or you would have no ability to perceive and see them. Since you are choosing point of view and focus, you still get to look at ideas that are within you, which are no longer representative of who you are. But this is a gift, this is sight, this is expansiveness. Being able to see things that were, shall we say, expressed from you and now simply are being viewed, allowed to be expressed by others. Integral, all one thing, all is one, one is all, this is integrity. Therefore, if you are willing to express unconditional love, if you are willing to determine and act upon your excitement and express the actions of your life with integrity, that is all there is to it. You are expressing what you call the Christ within you. By simply, shall we say using that triadic template. That's all there is to. Now again, you can add many details, but you will find it all boiled down to these three ideas. That encompasses it all. That is what your Jesus, the Christ, was embodied, was showing to your society. Look, this is possible. You can do this. I am not saying it is the only way. I am saying it is one way. There have been many misinterpretations of this. But none of them direct transcriptions from the mouth of Jesus himself. Who would be colloquially speaking, perhaps, a joke rolling in his grave. Were he to see many of the ways that his ideas are being, shall we say, misinterpreted. To actually mean the exact opposite of his clear intention, which was simply to walk his talk, express his unconditional love, which took the form of appreciation, which took the form of willingness to forgive, even what was considered by the society to be the most despicable of characters. That is the removing of the condition and demonstrating in no uncertain terms that this is possible, and that the individuals respond to this. When individuals are not invalidated, they respond. They look, they turn within, they use it as a mirror. They see, if someone else is willing to validate me at all costs, I may just be willing and able to validate myself. Living through examples. Living by the embodiment of the ideas you say you prefer with unconditional love, excitement, which adds some spice and makes it a little bit more fun. And integrity, which is a recognition, not a moral standard, a simple recognition. As you say, sometimes it can be summed up simply by your terminology, do unto others as you would have them do unto you. That statement is the recognition of integration of all things. Let that sink in for a while. In any given moment that you are expressing this, you are expressing the Christ. You are picking up the ball and running with it. You are being applauded by what you call the angel. And what you would perceive to be a singular expression of the Christ, Him, Her, but that is only one expression. You are each and every one of you, another eye of all that is. Eyes of creation itself, a facet, a point of view. Distinct, complete, and absolutely utterly worth it and deserving of your unconditional love, of your excitement, and of your integrity. Therefore, Merry Christmas. Before we proceed, we wish to also applaud you all once again for your willingness to begin to participate in these interactions by being willing in that sense to define what it is you wish to discuss and begin to focus. Not in an exclusionary sense, but for the purposes of furthering your understanding, for the purposes of increasing clarity to singular subjects and ideas, for now, perhaps for a while, as you say. And we will also allow some spontaneity about this. We will concur with the idea of you discussing at the break many subjects, and then unless there is an overwhelming consensus, perhaps we will, in sensing much of the energy, pick one. However, nothing is etched in stone. And should you find in that sense that the one we pick is simply not the one you wish to hear, please share that. For that is an expression of your willingness to continue to contribute and to assert who you are understanding that you deserve it. So our particular choice in this instance to get the ball rolling, as you say, will be the idea of expectation and disappointment. Is anyone disappointed about that? Oh, I will take that as a no, and it simply does not matter for when it was stated, there was, in that sense, a consensus reached. Therefore, again, if someone disagrees with it all well and good, simply stand up and speak. If not forever or perhaps temporarily, hold your peace. We also will mention that if in anyone's interaction, someone else is unclear about a particular point, you can feel free in that sense to ask for clarification, not in the form of stepping on who is speaking, not in the form of, shall we say, grabbing the stage for each one is, in that sense, worthy of attention and of direct interaction. But in the form of, in that sense, consider it request for clarification. This will be most useful to all involved, or understand if you do not understand something about what is being said in a particular interaction. As you say, chances are there are others with the same question. Simply trust this. One other idea. Many of you seem to have an issue with you. When a topic comes up, a question perhaps is asked. Whereby you say what a dumb question is. It is our strongest suggestion. And that is all it will ever be. There is no insistence from us that you do anything. However, it is our suggestion that you perk up your ears and listen to that answer more closely and carefully than any other answer. For if you have such a button to be pushed, why do you have that button? And what is the actual relationship of what you are invalidating when you say that? So therefore, simple suggestion is up to you. You can judge away, do whatever you wish, but you will find service. And many times, the greatest advantage in what you call these buttons that are pushed, and where you choose to think that something is extraneous. Well, how did that get in there? Perhaps that is the point. So again, it is up to you as it always will be. We thank you for your willingness to not only contribute and co-create this interaction, but a wow. For the channel to express himself as he is, for this to us is of great service to us. As any particular channel begins to embody and begin to take responsibility for who they are, it makes it that much more, shall we say, easy and flowing and simple. For us to express that much more through that channel. There are no conditions upon our arrangements, and there are no conditions upon our agreements with channels. But there are certain facts to how things unfold, and again, the more a channel chooses to act and embody what we are speaking of, the more of like vibration can be created for us to match, and then therefore ease. And increase the flow of our communications, the clarity of our communication, and interestingly enough, the amount of information that we can bring through, which again as a channel embodies, not talks about, not says it sounds nice, but embodies what we are saying. That much more can we then slip in things which the channel would seem to not know, which is of great desire to many of you, and as well, no less believe me to the channel, that we can now begin to bring in information which may seem on the surface to be quote unquote new. It is all new anyway, and you already know it all anyway, so this is rather arbitrary, but I believe that we have made ourselves clear, and I thank you for your willingness to allow me to ramble on. I am setting you on. What I want to ask is, it deals with this whole thing of ascension, which was asked earlier, and I have got my excitement in many areas, and one of them happens to be, we did a show with this Agedar Command, we did a four-part series, and one of the shows, one of the things Agedar asked me, who was coming through the inviting of the Agedar Athena was, how do you want us to come into the studio? Now, the question was asked me, would you like us to physically beam down? I said, well I don't know how you do things on your end to it. I said, but whatever you feel comfortable doing is fine with me. What ended up happening was there was an agreement, an equal agreement for a beaming down on their end, however they materialized, and we had an extra chair in the studio set for that to occur. What I was told before the last show was to start, the night of that show, that the Lord Sinanda, as you talked to Jesus Christ, or the Lord Sinanda, who they call the chief commander of their fleet shifts, of their fleet, would do a transfiguration. The first thing with transfiguration is to have the figure of the Christ himself, or the Lord Sinanda, or whatever other names you might have gone by his ancient terms, transfigure into the form in front of the body that's in the chair, sitting in the chair. Am I correct with that? First of all, our particular understanding is that what you call Jesus the Christ is not precisely the same as what you call Sinanda. What you call Sinanda is an individual expressing the Christ, so therefore the Christ, but not necessarily what you call Jesus himself. I understand that there are many separations within this concept, and that at the one shall we say, hand, Jesus and the Christ are synonymous, but since this is generally presented in an exclusionary type of way, we wish to draw the distinction, so therefore there is a difference in the two energies. So what Sinanda basically has the same Christ energy as you do, as we all do, so there's no difference obviously. Okay, well, they've made a change of plans, and what's Sinanda, as I was sitting in the studio, normally I interact with questions, my guess. I was just looking, I didn't know what to do, because I was in a situation where I looked at the eyes changing in terms of the eyes, when you look at somebody's eyes, it is said you can see into their soul of their being. And looking into the eyes, I can see at least the difference in the transmittory of the eye process, not necessarily this what Sinanda himself, they said that when people view the show, various people see different things. Well, that is a given, well, is that depending on the openness of their consciousness to the other realities of existence, or just not having limited consciousness to order to see that? It is strongly related to what would in fact serve them, so therefore will vary greatly from individual to individual. So some people might not see anything. Perhaps you can say most. Okay, so therefore that brings me to a frustration. Oh, because I was told one thing was going to occur, and actuality, what occurred was not in the agreement that was made. Now, may I ask you a question? Yes. How does that allow you to feel? What did you discover, and what choices did you make? You feel frustrated? Well, I felt frustrated. I don't feel that necessarily that way now. I felt frustrated because I was putting myself on the line, basically I felt with the viewers. Oh, so I felt that that connection was being put on the line. My integrity was being put on the line. Oh, and did you feel that it was breached? Yes. In what? And how was that? I didn't even question up the door, so to speak. And the door was a multitude of options. And the option, I said, okay, we'll go with the bean-down process. And then you feel that they did not deliver this? No, and it wasn't necessarily for my deliverance as much as it was for the audience to do that. Well, do not factor yourself and your own expectations out of this by any means. However, what will you now do in a similar circumstance, having learned and integrated from this experience? Will you put yourself out on a limb again? Not so quickly. So, therefore, you have defined your sense of discernment. You have become more discerning. Correct. Oh, what's your most definitely? Oh, does this not serve you? It does. I don't. I think that there's a lot of controversy over the ash tarp come in. Much of it has to do with what you colloquially call grounding and remaining grounded. Therefore, now you get the opportunity to decide to what degree as you are exploring spiritual realms as you are exploring extra terrestrial realms, just how firmly it serves you to keep your feet on the ground. That sounds much much better to keep my feet on the ground for my own integrity. And for your audience as well. And then seeing how you will choose to use this and how you will then, shall we say, alter your behavior to now embody your new sense of discernment and understanding will be a learning experience for all. Also, your willingness to allow it to be all right that you were in that sense, that's frosting in a particular circumstance. And you felt slighted. Allows your audience to see that they are dealing with a human just as themselves. So therefore, you have increased your rapport with your audience if you choose to view it that way and enter the situation with the shall we say, alterations with the changes embodying what you have learned and perhaps sharing it with them. I feel like I want to share with my audience because I feel a sense of disappointment because it was leading up to a mountain top, so to speak. We started from the bottom of the mountain and we went gradually climbing up to the top to see what was happening. But the point is rather than there being an embodied extraterrestrial being at the top of the mountain, your sense of discernment was what you climbed up to see. So therefore, you are at the top of the mountain. You can sleep back down to the valley or begin to yoke into shall we say, the depths of time and space. And now express who you choose to be. Well, audience, perhaps I was wrong or whatever, not necessarily that you were, but the idea is what you are feeling and your willingness as an equal to share that with your audience. Allow them to see that you are learning to, that you too are willing to perhaps explore beyond the shall we say quote unquote normal boundaries and you too are also willing to see where it does, but also does not work for you as well. We see opportunity and advantage lining these clouds upon your mountain top. I also felt that, I mean, we had good dialogue with AASHTAR and with Athena on the program when they embodied AASHTAR Athena, they co-opted the instrument, the embodiment. But if I had gone in that direction without bringing up the possibilities of the fourth possibility, which was the physical presentation, I might have been better off directing my energies in that direction. Well, not really, for you learn something very important. Again, given a similar set of circumstances, I assume you will make a different decision. I most definitely will. I have one other question. One moment. Not yet. There is also, again, what we will discuss in more detail in the future, so to speak, since it is the path to me anyway. The all are nothing principle. If there are things that you truly enjoy from those sources, take them. If there are things that don't work for you, push them aside. But you do not have to push it all aside unless you choose to. That is also an option, but because some of it did not work for you. So your willingness to see this works for me and this absolutely does not make you that much more clear. Makes you that much more defined, serves you to explore and define yourself very, very pointedly. And also allows you to see how to proceed from this point forward in your shell. I clearly did that. I clearly define a lot of issues through that one program. I have one other question about the ascension process, and that is, in terms of the way the AASHTART command presents this whole thing, they talk a lot about it. I went to one of the workshops to talk about the God, and AASHTART team was on two radio stations recently, a few weeks ago. When she was in Connecticut, AASHTART came through the environment and then they had Athena. And there was a lot of people calling on this talk show that were religions that were coming from very religious angles. Before you proceed, understand that the source that you call channel or whatever you wish to call it had religious background. I understand. And expressive and interprets the information through religious terminology, whether or not that is its original intention. Therefore, it can automatically only attract other like oriented, religiously minded individuals as well. Right, but is it the AASHTART commands to have this program as a willing instrument to communicate their information and dialogue to be religious or spiritual, or is there a misinterpretation from the general society when she communicates on, let's say, a radio station? Our perception is that the misinterpretations are through the individual channel. Now, we do not take this in any way as a chastisement, or as a deratement. Now, simply that there are certain, shall we say, background perspectives that get thrown in there which are not necessarily intended. Therefore, there is coloration of the material in this regard. So it's filtered to some degree, perhaps you can say that. And then the body means that information can be filtered as opposed to channel information, or is it? In varying degrees from almost non-present to very filtered. There are many examples of filtered communications in your society. Well, they talk about the ascension. Also, do not assume that your individuals upon your planet choosing to function in this regard do not have free risk. So you need not necessarily come from the perspective of why would they choose someone who would do this? Agreements are made, but the individuals then have the free will to embody the agreement in whatever way they will. Again, walk down that hole they will, but how they walk down that hole is completely up to them. And this is understood going into, so to speak, the arrangement. My understanding of the ascension process is that we are going, we are in fourth dimension going into fifth dimension. The veils are being so thinner now to the point where we will physically at some point interact in the fifth dimension where we call the ending of the older, which we would be considered the older, to the new earth, which is a template that has been set in the fifth dimension. The new earth would be a much different earth. We still be part of the earth. We are always a part of the earth. But it is so to speak. But the earth would be a different earth in terms of the fifth dimension. And is that your understanding of that? Well, in a sense, yes, though our terminology differs slightly. We prefer again to come from the perspective that you are now in third density. Perhaps what they are referring to as fifth dimension would correspond to what we present as fourth density. For to us in our particular explanation, fifth density is non-physical. And we will then therefore, generally, not associate with what you would call a planetary body or symbol of that type. So it is similar to what we call fourth density. We understand also that as the individuals upon a planet undergo a transformation, so does the planetary vibration itself. What you call your earth, perhaps you can say in all right, again, this is colloquial. But in second density awareness was referred to as a cation. So therefore, even the name may seem to change. But it is a pivoting point, so to speak, through many overlapping dimensions of experience. I understand. The thing about before, when we're mentioning about the question was raised before about the wave of ascension. And the understanding is that that wave of ascension is an ascension of total consciousness, am I correct? Well, what we are speaking of as transformational age initiated in your 87 year with an occurrence you call, or colloquially referred to as harmonic convergence, is again a wave of conduciveness for the unfoldment of the unlimited nature of consciousness. Okay, I understand that. From what they say, or Ash-Tar says, is that the first wave of ascension, 144,000 eagles, I'm not quite certain about that. They mean by eagles, but that there would be this first wave that would actually be under free will if they want to be beamed up into this Ash-Tar command shifts for further information and other things on the shifts and have use of the facilities on the shifts, not to get away from their planet, but to interact there and then come back to the planet as the first wave and then go into the process of the being basically teachers, having other people. We have discussed this. The idea is that much of what you are understanding and receiving is cloaked into what you would perhaps colloquially call biblical metaphor. Huh. The biblical metaphor. Ice. The reference to the 144,000 and so on. The 144,000 eagles is a biblical metaphor. In our perspective, it is more representative of the idea of oversold, which can be literally millions or billions of individuals that are reincarnated onto the planet at any time. In a sense, yes. So therefore, the star-stated connections are that they are in physical bodies, which maybe we can say in a sense we all are in a sense, only not. You can say that. I am not exactly sure. I am catching your drift. Can you be more clear? Well, if you say they are oversold, my understanding is that if we have reincarnated into physical bodies, we have reincarnated from other experiences, other lifetimes, other dimensions, other realities. Ice. But many times an oversold will not only manifest in what you call path life and future life, but also multiple contemporary cells. So therefore, one oversold can embody anywhere from several to hundreds of individuals upon your contemporary timeframe on your planet. So 144,000 oversold, and again, this is rather arbitrary, can represent, again, anywhere from thousands to hundreds of thousands to millions to billions of individuals that are living upon your planet right now, interesting. Thanks. Okay. Are we getting some? Yes, we are. You've pondered a lot of thoughts in my mind. I like the question about that. Oh, right. Please do. The oversold that you're talking about are one of those tenors, but aren't there any oversold of people that are existing on this planet where they, where the oversolds are not existing here or existing somewhere else? In a sense, you may understand this to be an arbitrage for every question. For what is strongly associated with your planetary sphere is what you would call the embodiment, and the oversold itself is timeless and spaceless. So this becomes a bit confusing. It can be seemingly associated strongly with the planet in one sense, but in another sense completely transcends physicality. So it becomes an arbitrage question. Again, I refer you to the fact that your body exists within your consciousness. Therefore, so does your planet. But if you wish to get more technically accurate, so does your solar system. So does your galaxy. So does your universe. So time and space become quite arbitrage. I do not mean to add more confusion, but sometimes accuracy about infinite knackers will do just that. Does this however give you any answer to your question that you can use? Oh, thank you. Oh, hugely. It's simply taking many portions, rearranging them, looking at them in a new life, and then making a new commitment to who you are. However, if you wish to clarify, ask a specific question. Well, what I wanted, what I was going to ask, I'm reading a book that Rudolph Stein, or a heard of him as a writer. Well, not personally, but you proceed. He translated the Kashi records. All right. A translation. Okay. One of the things he said was that the consciousness of a female person, who was a writer, the consciousness of a bee hajjist, is in another realm. And the bees, the bees are physical organs that are in the physical realm. So what I'm thinking is that this is a direct analogy to the oversold and the physical self. Yeah. Hey, perfect. Proceed. But our oversold, but you just said that our oversolds were in our realm too, even though they may be in another realm. Hey, it may present that way, but you are again speaking of a transcendental idea. So though you may, in that sense, sense projections or extensions of it, never in a physical finite sense, could you completely house the idea of your infinite over it? Oh, that's clear. Oh, thank you. Are you through? I thought I was. Oh, thank you. It would be encouraging and making sure. Thank you very much for all your answers to. Oh, and to you, for your marvelous answers posed as questions. Shutting your arm. I had a question about the agreements. When are the agreements made and how do we know what they are and when we are supposed to act on them? Does it come to us from the end of the knowledge that we have? Well, sometimes it will present that way. Agreements of a specific form may be made between what you colloquially call lives, between lives. Other agreements will simply be embodied into your overall essence. Many times you will, shall we say, proceed from within when the playing out of an agreement is most timely. However, remember, you are not within a reality. The reality is within you. Anything that you proceed within that reality is also within you, though it appears to be external. Feedback from the external reality is also another form of understanding the unfoldment of your target. One other way to put this is simply to what the situation be obvious. If something is not forthcoming, if it is not right there, if you cannot act upon it, it is an external expression of your internal agreement. Does that make sense? Not the whole line. Oh, oh, what? Then continue and do not settle until it does. In other words, can I make an agreement now? Yes, absolutely. And the nature of unconditional agreements is that you can also choose to not do it. But yes, you can make an agreement right now. Do you wish to? But then the other person has to agree also. Well, in general, your desire for the agreement tells you it is available. Do you wish to make an agreement right now? Yes, and I have expressed that, of course, in my own mind. And I just wait now, and now again this connects to your talk about intentions, intending something and not. Is that what one is supposed to do? Make an agreement sort of, in your own mind, and then say this is my intention. Is it the same thing? Well, there are no supposed things, but yes. Simply having the intention and then looking around very astutely and seeing, and I do anything about this particular intention right now. If you can, there's your external, so to speak, indication that this is the timing. However, if you cannot, there is also your external indication that this is not the timing. However, by then focusing back into the moment, seeing what's available and choosing with your excitement, you steer yourself toward that clear intention. Standing around and going, oh darn, it's not there, doesn't steer you quickly in that direction. And in fact, lengthens the process. Do go on. I kind of had a problem understanding intentions. I'll give an example. If you say I'm going to finish this degree in within two years, that's simpler, because it's up to you to finish that, to go to college and get the degree. But what if the agreement or the intention includes other people or other beings, then you have to wait for them to feel the same way, or if it includes other people on your planet, perhaps sometimes you would then rely upon the feedback from them. If it includes entities that you are channeling, you will understand that your desire and your understanding of your timing tells you that it is their timing as well. It is your timing, I assure you. Do you wish to boldly state the agreement you now wish to make? Place the order so to speak to the universe. At this point, I might have said I have some time back, maybe a couple of months, like I have placed the order, and I thought it happened and now I'm not sure if it did. Oh, it did. But what you are also learning, and I trust you are listening up, is about discernment. You get choices. Choices that will agree with you and will not, so that you can decide and empower yourself to decide, this is what I wish to have and intend to have, this is not. My reference to you in interacting with you internally is one with expanded sense. Your interpretation of that reference was what you had shared in the last interaction, because you strongly associate with the sense of smell. It was not incorrect to assume that I was communicating with you. Simply you were given the opportunity to discern where you had plugged in something and where I had offered something. It turned me more sensitive. Oh, if you say something, create all the time you wish, but understand, the agreements are in place. You are being given the opportunity to prime the pump, so to speak. And by deciding what you wish to interact with and what you do not, you become clear. That clarity allows the agreement to be fulfilled with laser-like precision. So, therefore, you are, shall we say, approaching the completion of the process of perhaps getting some information that may not agree with who you choose to be so that you can decide and state, no, this is not what I choose to channel. This is not what I choose to express. This is, that makes you part of the process, rather than thinking that you need to remove yourself from it. And this expedites or speeds along or accelerates the process itself. This will become more obvious. Yeah, I understand which pressure. And I'm getting there. I can feel it. I'm getting there. Oh, well, after interacting with me, do you feel better or worse? More confident. Oh, thank you. Now we're getting there. Is that all? I wanted to tell you, my daughter, my younger daughter, the 17-year-old, is here. She wanted to meet you and she's very excited and she's having a good time. Oh, thank you. And she would like to say hello and I think she would like to ask a question. Oh, please do. And my unconditional love and welcome to you. Hi, why? I don't know what's there. Perhaps you will ask, what should I ask? What should I ask? Oh, please. Can I ask you a question? Sure. What truly excites you the most? I don't know. Being here is really exciting. Oh, do you in that sense like the idea of expressing yourself and creating the life that you prefer? Yeah. Are you attracted to the idea of unconditional love? Yeah. Do you, shall we say, gravitate toward the idea of excitement? Yeah. Integrity. Merry Christmas. Thank you. And should something come up? Something seemed like a curiosity. Do remember there is no such thing from our perspective as idle curiosity. If you are wondering about it, it is worthy of being expressed and shared. And we thank you for saying hello. Thank you. Thank you. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. One more. I am choosing. Over there, my love. Greetings. Oh, imagination. Thank you. Greetings to you, my friend. You to draw upon great strength, great conviction. So perhaps you may wish to toss that one out. Thank you. And remember, that was colloquial. You can't toss anything out. I have that appearance. My dear was that my excitement about helping the world and developing more sustainable economic systems. If this is background and perhaps problem solving ability, then I would be able to help develop solutions to those problems. Now, before you go on, that feeling and the desire and the excitement about this tells you in no uncertain terms that you are able. Otherwise, it would be extreme. It's in you to draw upon great strength, great conviction. So perhaps you may wish to toss that one out. Oh, thank you. And remember, that was colloquial. You can't toss anything out. You cannot get rid of anything. But in transforming it, it may have that appearance. My dear was that my excitement about helping the world and developing more sustainable economic systems might have been coming from a place that's from grandiosity or insecurity rather than being my pure excitement. Well, which is it? Tell me that. Don't hesitate. I've had the question. It's my excitement. Oh, why? There's your answer. In developing options, job options, some are opening up in different parts around the world. But nothing has solidified yet, and it almost seems like I'm becoming less clear on what I should be doing now. And I'm getting scared because my money's going to run out in about two months, so I have to start working within the next month or two. How often do you say my money will run out in three months? Oh, now it's two months, so now it's one month. Well, I've been saying that for about a year or anything. What you ask for and what you assert, you get it. Yes, but it's been expanding through yet, and I'd rather not have it go that way anymore. Oh, is there something that you can immediately act upon that I'm serious? Not something to keep you busy while your excitement is. Shall we say while you are waiting? Not that I'm aware of. There's one partially exciting option, but that's only an option. Oh, partially? It's not manifested yet. I could maybe do a consulting contract for utility in the bottom. Is that exciting? Not really. Oh. Do you really wish to do that? No. Oh, right, now that that's out of the way, what had you just... Well, I would like to somehow... I've been trying to write a letter or a physician paper on what's my idea of expressing my ideas on... Stop. Stop. After all we've just got... You are still trying to write a letter? No. No. No. I am not making fun of you. I am simply pointing out, sit down and write a letter. Stop trying and start doing it. When I have sat down and begun to write it, I haven't been consciously clear and I felt more like going out and taking a walk or reading a book or something like that. Oh, a suggestion. First of all, do not sit down to write it unless you are initially excited about doing so. But once you sit down for there have been many times where you have had bad initial excitement, yes? Yes. And you begin to, shall we say, create a similar seeming pattern. Stop. Take a deep breath. Take three deep breaths. Think about something that does excite you. Drum up the vibration of the excitement itself, till you feel it in every fiber of your being. Open your eyes, write the letter. Connect with your excitement first. If it wanes, do it again. If it wanes, do it again. If it disappears, get out of there. Okay, my fear is that if I express those ideas, I'll be rejected or labeled as a quack or something like that by these standards. Ah, fear of failure. Will you still have the clear intention even if they say get lost, target? Yes, because I feel like they're going to have to face it sooner or later. Well, can you then truly ever fail? No, but... This is one of the reasons we discussed in the beginning of this interaction, that particular perspective on failure. Failure is simply selling yourself out of your clear intention. So, remind. Remind. Remember your clear intention. Assert it. Call it forth in these moments. Do you have a fear of success? I think so. Oh, all right. We've also discussed this. So plug in what we have shared with again, allowing the feedback of your reality to simply be completely obvious. I desire this right now, and when it comes along, the coming along is my indication that I can handle it. Remind yourself. Simple. Remember. So, if I act on my side, I mean, I'll keep my abundance. I will continue to be abundant as I have been over. Well, you will express that abundance in positive, exciting terms. Okay. Okay. Another question. I've been applying the concepts of choosing to follow my excitement in the present moment, and I've been creating some wonderful things in my life. However... Oh, here it comes. I don't do it in the whole time. Oh, then however... I don't know why I backed up from doing that. I mean, I'm like, it's fun, it works. Question. Why do you back off from doing that? Fear of failure, fear of success. Again, plug in what we have shared. It will come in handy. It comes in the most handy while it is happening. Sounds nice while you're sitting here happy, having eaten some nice food, and interacted with many lovely individuals. But comes in the most handy in the situation. Remember, remind, use the tools. You have them all. Your toolbox is unlocked. Your tools are shiny and ready to go. Thank you. Thank you. Another question is, last night I drove through my hometown and was feeling a lot of luck for me as a child. I reminisced about all the places that I recognized. But when I drove down my street and remembered the kind of unloving abuse of childhood I had, I was overcome with sadness and I cried for quite a while. Well, did you let it out? Yes. What did it feel like? I was trying to analyze it while I was doing it. What did it feel like? Analysis is not feeling. We'll get to analysis in another interaction. It felt concerning. What now will you do? Because that happened. How will that affect your actions? Well, I want to try and... Oh, I'm not letting that feel like that. I intend. I intend. Remove, try, replace with intent. That is power. That is certainty. That is, I don't know when the heck it's going to happen, but I will have it happen. I intend. Now, what were you intending to do? Well, I feel that the limiting belief system that I got partially from that environment has been keeping me from following my excitement and my intention. Is to perhaps reinterpret my childhood in a way that's more empowering. Oh, right. But more directly. Because of this, you will be an excellent problem. And that is the point. Oh, yeah, I love children. Forgive your parents. And be the parent you choose to be. Having had a blatant example of what you did not and will not choose to be. Oh, thank you. One of the benefits of following my excitement is that I've been having a bit... One more. Listen up. Proceed. One of my... Okay. One of the benefits of following my excitement is that I've been having a much greater number of very fulfilling relationships in my life, mostly with women. And for the first time, I have a lot of women friends that are just friends where there's no sexual aspect of it. And I feel a very... a greater level of love, like a brother and sister type of love, just hanging on. Ah! Stand up. Hey. Place your right hand over your head. Pat yourself on the back. Oh, thank you. Are you bad? Stop taking me. Thank yourself. Go ahead. It's been very fun. Oh, my... Understand. This is a blatant external reflection that you are now beginning to unconditionally involve your staff. Thank you. Thank you. It's felt wonderful. It's still with... Yes, I love it. It's celebrating. It's rapidly with the needs. Oh. The question I have though is I've been setting the concept of anima a little bit from... Carl Jung. And as I look at women that I am attracted to, I seem to project... They'll reject me and therefore I feel some anger towards them and kind of push up safety nets so I don't need to get close to them or whatever. Are you sick and tired of that? Don't like it at all. Stop. I want to make my attitude to other women. Oh. Then go right. That's all there is to it. You feel the old voice coming up. You say, I'm through with that. Period. Decide. Be certain. Command. Consciously. With integrity. What you wish to occur. You're already doing it. Simply extend it in this area. Okay. One more. For now, that will be. For now. But listen up. You will hear more of what you are asking through others. And I thank you. Thank you. Over there, mate. Be lying. I have a question about the phrase I had in Egypt of a guide coming through me, Daniel. Ice. And I've been connecting with him quite a bit in meditation. And Bashar Fudero said that he was someone who was very ancient, or an ancient aspect of my own consciousness. And all I had to do was think about ancient times to tap into his energy. Perhaps as a metaphor. Yeah, exactly. It's a symbol. Can you give me an update on how that has been going for me and anything else I may add to that? Oh, yes. This is going to be fun. Close your eyes. Picture an ancient scenario and allow Daniel to speak. Breathe deeply and drink from the sea of life. From the sea of love and knowledge. And allow that aspect to come through smoothly. This is Daniel. Greetings, O wise one. What did you wish to express this evening? That we all are ancient, have ancient aspects of ourselves available to us. All we need to do is believe that, trust that. Listen to that part of ourselves. Do you have a suggestion for how one may ground this knowledge into the here and now? Try trusting and believing in that possibility. And that ancient knowledge by remembering who you have been or you can be. Is there not something else? Yes. By breathing, by finding a unique ritual or symbol for tapping into that energy that is unique to you. Try trusting whatever comes to you. That is... That's all. That was quite a bit. And I think you do understand each and every one of you what has just been shared. As we have often discussed, your imagination allows you specific access to your totality. Specific connection and perhaps you can say expression of your higher self through physical terms. Therefore be mindful of the symbols that you attract. Be mindful of the symbols that appear in your mind's eye. They do so for a reason. They are triggers. They are catholic. They will be different from individual to individual. Certain individuals will gravitate toward an extraterrestrial symbol. Certain individuals will gravitate toward an angelic symbol. Certain individuals will gravitate toward historic symbols. Whatever it is that truly attracts you is a direct reflection of a metaphor. A identification vibratory energy that will allow you to unfold. So therefore begin to trust your imagination in that sense. You already trusted fine and dandy with what if negative scenarios simply take that same trust and apply it simply because you say so. Simply because you wish now to also allow it to serve you in a positive way. That is one of the reasons you have an imagination to begin with. That is, shall we say, the meeting ground between yourself and all other aspects as you create within the separations of your understanding aspects. Your imagination is the key. Your imagination is the meeting ground. The imagination of the channel is where this interaction takes place on your plane of existence. From my end it is taking place in my imagination. However, I trust you are there. For I trust my imagination. Your willingness to do the same. No different from what I myself do, not that I specifically am important in any way, gives you the same effect. If you feel something is there and it creates itself for your imagination as a symbol, that symbol is significant. If you grab that symbol, if you wrap yourself around that symbol, if you keep your eyes open, it will pop up all over the place. It will attract you. It will be a barometer. It will be a compass needle pointing you from idea to idea to idea. So you no longer shall we say have use for the removal of responsibility to a symbol, but I do not mean this in any way, in a negative way. You are in a reality whereby you express in symbolic terms. Therefore be willing to use the symbols you call for. Be willing to also allow this individual a walker upon fire as an example of what you are all capable of, for he has directly tapped into an energy that is perhaps on the one hand part of him, but also distinct and discreet from him in the way you create your reality. I was in full perception of the message, quote unquote, prior to its delivery. Perhaps I then shall we say drew certain ideas out, but his perception and deliverance of the ideas were extremely accurate. You all have this ability. You can express it in whatever way you wish. If it does not excite me in that sense to go in front of people and channel, you can do it in whatever form does, riding your bike down the street. Anything. There will be but a few moments remaining to this interaction. One moment. Do you proceed? We had this ongoing conversation about future counterparts. Bashar said that Daniel would just be a precursor to other energies coming through. Is it possible that I would be channeling these future aspects or counterparts of myself? Anything else you can say about that? Have a good trip. Thank you for your assistance. Oh, thank you. You have done it all. Hey, Daniel. I wanted to apply. Many? Why are people here? All one. I wanted to add something to the introduction to the second half you had said to do unto others that you were sent to do unto you. Well, cool. I wanted to add to do unto yourself as you do not. Oh, understood. Very astute. Again, loving others as you love yourself pretty soon with that you do. And also is prerequisite to expressing the ability to love others. So thank you for the distinction. And I wanted to share that I'm... Relocating? Yes. Thank you. Preparing to relocate and... Are you attracted to the area you are going to? Yes, very much. And the energies that are there. Trust that. Everything will unfold as a red carpet before you. If you concentrate on the excitement, you will accelerate the process. Oh, right. And I extend my invitation to you and the other friends of mine associated with you and Esipani to visit and be with me. I know that there is no distinction, there is distinction, but no real big difference. Es, but do not be too surprised if in some way shape or form, perhaps at a distance, we take you up on this physically. Okay. I invite that. There is increased activity in this regard upon your planet from our society at this time. In the waters of the Palmas and Florida where I will be, do you have anything to say about the energy working in the waters there? Hey, go play. Have a good time. Bring a ball. Well, if you wish. I love this. And thank you. Oh, thank you. For sharing with us your dreams. And your waking dream, which to us are one of the same, but we understand you still as a society draw the distinction. Do you have anything to say about the tiger sharks playing in my dream, wanting you to come into the water with us? Hey. They were only interpreted as sharks. Directly after that, dolphins jumped up onto the rocks. But what you were perceiving is the hesitation, the fear in that sense, that something you do not prefer may occur, but understand you may come on in the waters just fine. Thank you. Oh, thank you. Shut it. Come on. Hello. Hello. Hello. I have a clear intention to try and not try to present a different viewpoint to a friend of mine who is rather suddenly under an attack with cancer. Her name is Sherry. Good timing. There are a lot of our friends, if all tennis friends, that are very, very upset and very frightened with what's going on. That will be one of the options available to her as well. I'm sure that's what she's experiencing. But when she comes home from Sloan Kettering Hospital, I would like to go to her and share with her how I would think where I in her position. And I was hoping and then present her a copy of this session. And I was wondering if you could sense anything, if there's anything you could add, that would be helpful to her. First of all, compassion is identifying empathically with someone. What you generally refer to, and these terms are somewhat interchangeable, but for the purposes of drawing some delineation. And the sympathy is in a sense a reinforcement of powerlessness. So you can express compassion without feeding into and reinforcing the options that that individual will have to express powerlessness victimhood. The unconditionally loving, be sincere, but do not be insistent and allow the perspective to be very loving and gentle. All right, I understand, you may say, what is overwhelmingly negative seeming about this. And you will have plenty of time to think about that. However, just as a counterpoint, just to, shall we say, view both sides of the coin, what does this force you to do? What does it force you to look at? And what does it actually allow you to do that you had not done before? This is not the general approach, but it is a valid question. And if asked in an unconditionally loving way, something will come up. For willingness to look at what it allows or perhaps forces her to do, and think about consciously simply looking at that, or doing that thing by choice out of preference, then shall we say, make the symbol obsolete. This ease is simply an embodiment of a symbol delivering a message. Get the message, then the messenger has no reason to hang around. Deny the message. The messenger rings the bell more loudly, knocks on the door more loudly. Eventually get the battery ramp and breaks the door down. You cannot deny what is within you and you need not deny what is within you for. There is nothing within you that can destroy you. Things you do not prefer, yes. But that can destroy you without your permission? No. So therefore acknowledging what you are denying does not give it any more power over you. And in fact, decreases its seeming power over you. Acknowledgement, acknowledgement, acknowledgement. Then you can see what your choices are. Deny one choice, and you do not have all the choices before you. For now that will be a beginning. That's great. Thank you very much. Oh, thank you. Is that all? Yes, that is. Thanks. Shut it. Hey, smile, back there. After the last session that we had here. One moment. And to you. Good day. You are very present. And after the last session here, I have some very different feelings than what I usually do. Paying this stuff. Oh, it's heavy. Yeah, well, it's heavy stuff. It's heavy. How much did you have to drink? Just checking. Yeah, it was different than that kind of anyways. I went home and had some very strange dreams. I had a, when I figured it was a physical encounter. Describe? Describe? I don't know with who. I didn't. Well, do not describe what you don't know. Describe what you do. Actually, what it was, was a very sensual dream. But then the face became. And by the way, one moment you missed nothing. Do proceed. Well, I can get them down. One bigger point of the dream was that they were taken to see me from my taken to see me. I was donated. Well, quite a difference. Yeah. I mean, I don't mean it to this. Understood. Okay. You proceed. All right. After that, there was a scroll of colors that were going by my third eye. There was a cream and whiteish color and green. They would change formations and then go into what I was judging as the in the hideous spaces. And then I decided that they weren't idiots but they were beautiful. So it was just a taken to judge me off the other ones. And they changed after that. And it just kept going. I had this wonderful sensation at me. And woke up. At this point I was actually awake. But the colors continued. But I didn't sense the beings as actually being there anymore at that time. I knew they were with me but not because of the way you know. I'm just wondering who to this is. That will do as a label case. Okay. Why will that do as a label? Well, for that is all I will share. But the idea is they are rather all right, heavy. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Is there anything else? Isn't that enough? Yeah. Oh, you think? Wasn't it? Okay. Any more than night? You will see. I assure you. At this time, allow me to once again compliment you on the astounding success of this interaction. By maintaining clear intention, it could have no other shall we say turn out. This is a simple analogy to your life. If you are willing to dig, you will get what you want. If you are willing to maintain your intention, you will get what you want. Perhaps now, apropos will be the idea that you always will get what you want. Perhaps not always when you think you should, but always in perfect timing. And as you begin to flow with your timing, you will get a better sense of when things will come about and they will seem to manifest more immediately with less time as you acknowledge within the separations that you create that everything is part of you and pull it all together. You create less time for you no longer need that time to view each and every part. So your perception of time will begin to change. It will seem in that sense that it is flying by. You are creating less of it, but only as you flow with your life and allow your reality to be obvious. Reestablish and maintain your clear intention and you will never fail. I thank you. Did you a most fond and loving? Good evening.
