 Greetings this evening of your time. How are you? Oh thank you very much. Allow me to begin this interaction with the entitlement. Remember the association with a little bit of hyphenation between re and member. Allow me to first explain that we have from time to time shared with your society the notion of an association of many planetary societies. Do understand that this is in no way shape or form what you would label an army and in fact though it may appear to someone viewing it from quote unquote outside to have a hierarchical structure within it from within the structure there is no higher one of the shall we say motto's perhaps you can say since that translates adequately into your language that in that sense applies very strongly to the association is the idea in and of itself of unity in diversity therefore allow me now to express and extend to you shall we say a degree of individual membership to the association. Now do understand planetary membership global membership is something which is just that and agreement by your inside society on mass to participate in that way so in that sense I am not at this moment extending to your entire planet shall we say global membership but there has now reached the threshold has now reached the point within many individuals whereby you may simply in that sense individually so to speak enjoy shall we say what you might call somewhat colloquially a limited membership pun intended now this is all that there is to it this is really quite simple again unity and diversity would perhaps be the banner that you would fly and this will translate in many different ways into many different society the way that it would translate into your society the method that we will use this evening to shall we say make the point will fall into basically five ideas that we have discussed before when in that sense you are the embodiment of these five ideas any moment that you are you are in that moment a member virtually virtually because you are acting like one and in that sense perhaps you can say for the limited individual membership that we are extending all you need to is act like a member when you do you are a member perhaps in that sense if you do not then you no longer are but you are activating and perhaps you can say sometimes deactivating your own membership this is solely from you in that sense number one unconditionally love yourself and others very simple it is simply the understanding of unconditionality and again you can only do so in response to others to others in your reality when first you will afford yourself that unconditionality removing the conditions to your willingness to love yourself is really quite simple where we perceive it as difficult is in the imposition of the conditions themselves and the withdrawal of the love the self love when you in that sense do not meet the conditions so simply becoming unconditional is a matter of simply saying no matter what I will love myself there may be things from time to time that I explore that I do not prefer but I will use them and not impose the condition that should I explore them I will remove myself love as in that sense you do so as in that sense you afford yourself that complete unconditional self love you also then extend that to your ability to unconditionally love others in a sense you can say you get practiced there is sometimes a notion that if you just love others enough perhaps you will then love yourself but that is a bit backwards and to the degree that you are not willing to love yourself you will always have the barrier to loving another to that same degree for your willingness to exercise your ability to be unconditionally self loving reflect in all your external relationships so number one is simply unconditional self love and love of others number two is the recognition that everything is synchronous and acting that way for regardless of whether or not you do choose in that sense to see that everything is synchronicity it still is that is automatic everything is synchronicity they are inseparable when in that sense you are willing to view that it must be synchronicity you will allow yourself to see why you created it you allow yourself to see how it serves you and that is positive synchronicity but when you deny it it is still synchronicity though perhaps your experience of something you are denying will be interpreted along negative lines which we will get to number three perhaps this is new to some perhaps not from what is available in every given moment do what excites you the most with integrity and we purposely in that sense presented this in the middle of the five for it is the hub around which all five of these ideas in that sense revolve and it will always be the action that when and if you take in a sense you may understand the rest to be automatic so number three do what excites you the most from what is available in any given moment with integrity number four everything in your reality all events are a set of props with no built in meaning you supply the meaning and the meaning that you supply determines the effect you get out in that sense this is in somewhat two number two that everything is synchronicity for your willingness in that sense to begin to understand that the meaning is assigned by you and not inherent in the symbol is generating your willingness to act as though everything is synchronicity so they are linked very closely interlaced very closely number five the present is not a result of the past you create the past from the present you create the future from the present and in fact you only ever create in and from the present the present is the only time that ever exist it is the only time you ever experience all events are simultaneously occurring all events are right now but what you perceive as the secession of moments is the playing out along the linear timeline of that totality but it all exists as one unit right now and it is simply your willingness to explore your style of timeline reality that allows it to appear again to be a success shall we say progression of moments your understanding and willingness in that sense to understand that the present is not a result of the past is a key that literally in and of itself will unlock you entirely from third density and allow you to walk as a fourth density being upon your world or what in that sense individuals will generally use to bind themselves to time is the notions of having an effect having an ability to have an effect in a present moment now when you create that the present is a result of the past yes it feels that way yes you will get the evidence of it but what we are speaking of is that that is only an option one option and your other option is to understand that the past has perhaps led to the present but no longer has any effect in the present other than what you assign so therefore you are the ultimate assigners you get to assign in that sense the timeline and you get to assign positive or negative meaning to all symbols that have no built in meaning these five ideas in that sense five representing many things it is the human form number you have five races upon your planet you have five shall we say electrochemical senses you have at least at this time five races upon your planet and therefore for the purposes of this convenience for this symbol that you have created as a representation of you matter for we render much of what we have discussed with you down to these five ideas understand the following when you act according to the parameters that we have just discussed you are a member of the association you vibrate as a member of the association and thereby can be seen can be found can be perceived by other members of the association again there is a distinction to be drawn perhaps between individual invitation and global invitation when in that sense your society as a whole decides that it may wish to join the association it will be doing automatically the things that we are already discussing and the vibration of your society itself shift in a way that you are now within a different vibratory reality where you right now as a planet to as you say explore space you would find many and uninhabited planet and perhaps find right now with the vibration of your society right now a rather barren neighborhood but simply the slightest shift in your vibratory awareness by acting as a self-empowered being which is what all in that sense association members are you literally shift your vibratory reality when you do this as a planet you then begin to explore shall we say areas that may now appear to have life where there was none before but the idea is you have become the vibration to now be able to perceive that life and again globally this will occur to some degree you are crossing a threshold in the global sense both today and tomorrow of your time whereby you will find as individuals it will be that much easier that much more effortless for you to begin to act in this way for there is now enough momentum within the map consciousness to so to speak so to speak you still are active this is not a path in process but so to speak right on the coattails of your math consciousness such is the power of the momentum that you have created when you are willing as individuals to act as members of the association you will find you will begin and many of you already have to literally see things that weren't there to interact with other levels of reality that your society has not agreed on math to interact with sometimes perhaps you will see things as you say out of the corner of your eye this will not be uncommon and has already again to some degree already begun do understand this is a very exciting time upon your plan you have already began to transform as individuals particularly those present and have done so without shall we say the benefit of the gate you are about to walk through so you will find that many of the areas that you have formally created a sense of difficulty in will begin to smooth out will begin to make sense will begin to fit will begin to piece together the puzzle that you are in a very blatant way understand as we speak we are meaning myself what you would label best on and a female individual from my planet in your immediate solar system therefore this is a very strong shall we say area of time also to communicate with us now not that there really is a difference from our end how close our far we are approximately but there seems to be from you so therefore you can remove any of these particular conditions and understand we are nearby and welcome from any individual the willingness to interact as you say in your consciousness as you are willing to embody the five ideas that we have discussed flawlessly simply because it makes sense to you simply because it represents who you are you will again begin to notice differences in your perceptive reality one particular shall we say prevalent change in your perception will be the idea you call your perception of the passage of time itself for again you do not exist within time but literally create time and this gate shall we say one of the characteristics of it will be that it will now enable you to begin to loosen up your grip on your creation of time you will find as you are beginning to be the person you say you prefer to be you will literally create less time which will appear to you that time has flown by as you say but in that sense you are literally creating less time for you are integrating the many parts that you are and now that you no longer have so many parts to you you no longer need to create the time to do so and as you integrate your perception of time will in that sense exponentially seem to in that sense accelerate you are literally creating less time if in that sense and we have shared this before members of your society perceive the passage on your clock of one hour but you experientially perceive the passage of approximately fifteen of your minutes understand that you have created less time in relation to the creation of time of your mass consciousness and though they have perceived the hour and have aged the hour you have only perceived and only aged the fifteen minutes and you will find as a direct result of being aware of this for you do it automatically anyway that you can accelerate and enhance that particular ability which will literally prolong your physical life literally one thing that also as well ties into this most strongly is again your willingness to release what you perceive to have created as the chains shackling you to your for that past only has the ability to hold you in such a way because no one ever told you anything else now we are sharing that and it will always in that sense be your option to choose your old reality or your new and we are not even saying that the new is any better simply that it may enable you to create your reality according to preference within a time frame that you find most desire because you literally again create less separation and then therefore create less time in which to experience yourself and begin to simply be in the moment simply be part of being is looking around and seeing what is right there each moment is unique each moment is a gift each moment is a present if you will you in that sense get to unwrap that present moment but you only do so by firmly grounding yourself to that moment and only express that by seeing what's right there living in the moment is that simply simply factoring out what you cannot act upon and choosing with your integrity and with your excitement from what you can act upon before we proceed to interact allow us to also say when we say do what excites you with integrity and have explained many times that we mean integrity means your recognition of your integration with all things this would always mean doing what excites you while still maintaining your agreement now understand part and parcel of the idea of agreement itself is the ability to communicate the ability to perhaps you can say change or alter the agreement if it no longer works for you but integrity again is cognizance of the agreement and not willingness to move unilaterally in that sense so therefore you can still do what excites you and be cognizant of what it is that is within your integrity of the agreement you have made therefore nothing is being breached and there is no reason in that sense to create what you call guilt about doing what excites you for when you are truly doing what excites you with integrity it is always only of service to you and only then of service to everyone else for when you are willing to be who you are most firmly without any hesitation you are then that much more a clarified clear sparkling example to everyone and that is what they see the example perhaps you can say they see you as an example more than they actually will hear what you have to say so your actions truly do speak in that sense louder than your work therefore because you are eternal though you are expressing that eternal mess through timeline you may understand though we are speaking about becoming a member of the association in the ultimate sense you already are and in the sense are simply now reactivating your membership remembering yourself to the association as a member willing to act in the way that expresses two individuals in your society so that they may see that it is possible and quite pleasant that there is such a thing as the unity by the granting of validity to the diversity and only in the situation that you have created your planetary situation can this be conveyed to individuals at this time by example for there is shall we say quite an abundance of promises quite an abundance of realities that one can partake of in your society in your political structure in your economical structure in your sociological structure but in that sense understand that you created all you are in that sense the ground breakers the trail blazers for you will enable individuals to see to whatever degree you succeed in being self empowered unconditionally loving willing in that sense to assign meaning according to preference willing in that sense to free yourself from the bondage of what you consider to be your unpreferred you will literally provide and service in that sense that is unprecedented on mass in your society within your recent history so as you act like a member not only are you more visible to us and to the many other members of the association but you also become a more blatant gift and symbol of the association to your society and again only you can prove it but if you decide to it does work so therefore it is an example of a system that works but only when you apply it and you will begin to find an increased interest by individuals in your periphery to these ideas not as you speak them not as you display enthusiasm about them but as you embody them and remember the association therefore allow us to express our unconditional love and ecstatic joy at your willingness to begin to interact with us at equal to begin to unfold into your own diversity without in any way taking away from your notions of integrity integration unity you are in that sense a mini mass consciousness and you have in that sense an impact on the maxi mass consciousness truly this is you will begin to see blatant evidence of this and it has already began but will find as of tomorrow of your time a blatant acceleration therefore allow us again to thank you for co-creating this gateway with many other consciousness and with members in that sense of your own ancient times we thank you and ask now how may we be of service to you this evening I would like to talk to you along those lines about control always I was a little girl being sexually abused in my family I felt very out of control and then later on being in psychotherapy for about six years trying to learn how to integrate my feelings and how they work I began to understand that you have to accept your feelings but at that time when I was in therapy it was a very hard time of feeling totally out of control well again relating not being able to breathe and being totally fearful with no control over at all they called it free floating anxiety you know with no control over what I was feeling and after I learned a lot about feelings I still didn't feel that I had answered all the questions when my parents killed and I felt totally out of control again and I would just like to know where does this where does all this fear come from well again emotions are always a reaction or response to a belief and this isn't enough itself a liberating notion where they do not exist in a void do not exist in a vacuum and only can you use them by first granting that you have created them and feeling them allowing them in that sense to run their course where you feel the lack of control is in trying to in that sense stop the course of the flow of your creation which in that sense is impossible you cannot get rid of it where will you put it but what it allows you to do by coming to the surface is to look at the belief and decide whether or not you wish to keep that now this was not necessarily your approach when this would occur but now that you have become familiar of this through these interactions do you now see where they are the windows to your belief themselves I understand that but is control the same thing as our creating in other words what we create is the same I feel like you can't control anything really I can't control what I'm going to feel five minutes from now what's going to happen to me five minutes from now but is it what you are speaking of of control is controlling in a forceful way having it be just this way melding it forming it to be exactly this way that is one form perhaps you can say a control that is the form of control however that presupposes within you that you are not in control and therefore need to make or force something or have something conform as the evidence that you are in control you set up a resistance which you then overcome as external evidence that you are in control but understand that you can simply realize the notion within you that you are already in control and that therefore to express that control is an allowance and not a forcing part of your particular reasons for choosing this style of reality with the forgetfulness that you impose of the other lives and portions or portions of your totality is the idea of the unfoldment and the joy of the discovery but this is an allowance and this is also truff in what you would call timing whereby many times individuals who feel out of control simply insist that a particular timing is the only way that they will accept it and if it does not come at that timing they are out of control for they have not gotten their way but understand that you can trust in timing and you can simply say this is my intention it is my clear intention therefore because I desire it because I am excited about it it is a representation of who I am if I am simply willing to continue to blatantly be who I am it will come along and manifest because I say so and because it is a representation of who I am but it will only do so in the exploration of timeline and timing in a particular timing which when that timing comes you then find that it had a particular advantage in being in that time so basically what we are discussing here is trust and understanding of timing and allowance rather than domination does that answer the question yes that helps a lot and I would like to just ask you on your planet do you have no fear no anger no sadness is just total unconditional love yes we do not experience it quite in that way and you will find as you allow these emotions and use them and glean and find that a particular set of beliefs which are generally disempowering beliefs lead to fear lead to the helplessness of the invalidation of anger you begin in that sense to simply choose not to believe that and when you no longer believe something that has the corresponding shall we say result of what you are labeling these types of emotions you no longer experience those types of emotions now understand you do not need you do not need negative emotion in order to experience the positive by standing out in really now that is one way obviously but it is not the only way there is sometimes arises the notion from members of your society that you need to have some misery to appreciate your happiness and yes that is true but it is not the only truth what I am getting at is we are not born and we do not feel any diminution of our happiness because we have no sadness to weigh it again we simply revel in the ecstatic joy which has many nuances many what you may consider emotionality but none with negative interpretation we also have no not one little bit of what you would call doubt in our conscious man we always are 100% committed to what we are doing for we understand that only can we attract a representation of who we are so we are always firmly ready and willing to dive into whatever we create for we know that there are jewels to be discovered within any is that of service I have one other question I'd like to ask you all the space probes that left the print and my mom my father cabin in me if he had been there could he have seen them what do these probes look like and are there people in them and if I just had coming down and taking pictures of us now understand that there are many civilizations and many many different styles of probe the one that we are perceiving you are thinking about is in general spherical and we'll have particular protrusions upon quote unquote landing which is not always in that sense you will in general in flight perceive it to be of a reddish life is there a spaceship right close and approximately that drop down from not exactly in proximity in the shall we say sense that you mean it perhaps from our perspective where might it have come from our strongest perception of that particular probe would originate from what you label reticulate they to reticulate one more thing I've been working very hard on I'm trying not to be fearful and to stay grounded are you tired only to work so hard simply feel it allow yourself to understand on some level you know what you're doing feel it create it dive into it oh this is only fear not yet at terror get into it feel it whatever you're going to create as you say go for it then you will be in the frame of mind to very easily understand what you believe I want to share something we are I thought with part of possession of my part the whispering that were in my bedroom you told me you thought we're data or whatever and they had just continued trying to get in touch with me because I was too fearful so I thought to myself well next time something like that happened I don't force myself to keep my eyes open and see what I see now in that sense relax you don't have to force yourself can simply do so from the curiosity but do proceed well going out of my bedroom the other night to go to the bathroom I came back in in the corner of the room I saw this face with a black planty eyes and I shut my eyes and I opened it again and I looked and I thought well maybe not this time they ran around Tom's under dead made him push over so I could get in and just say what somebody really they are always that just a way of my projecting it in my dream state to see if I could really handle it yet now perhaps we mean to unsettle you with this answer but both you get to choose in a sense you may understand that by not having made the choice you are within a universal reality whereby either can shall we say become true if in that sense it serves your purposes to disengage from the interaction it will in that sense be simpler to have it have just been fantasy but if in that sense you choose to progress and continue on with it then it will become most obvious that it quote unquote was real but this is the degree to which we will allow perhaps you can say to the last moment you to believe that we exist or not believe that we exist so that our interacting with you does not in that sense interfere with that decision you will always perhaps you can say until we blatantly physically face to face interact have the ability to choose not to believe in and then therefore create a world perhaps you can say whereby we do not interact with you integrating that fear seems to be the key here where they just allow the fear to come and then try to put some you know conscious decision about it in my head or like Tony when he had him appear in his bedroom or whatever he said it took him a few weeks to integrate the fear and I just don't know how to do that well again it can be integrated in the flash of the moment that you are willing to experience it and allow the fear to deliver to you to hand right to you the belief that causes the emotion for that belief will be number one a belief with which you will say yes I do believe that perhaps you will also say wish I did not but yes now that I have brought it to my attention it is most obvious that I believe and here is your religion for you cannot change it till you own that I really do believe it but it's that fear of losing control you use the fear and understand that you can only in that sense have the control you are speaking of by letting go and allowing your reality to be the reality reflective and supportive of who you are oh thank you have a good time Leslie Trie hey thank you and thank you for being there I had a very interesting week I had a visitation from members of the white brother and members of the Purple Council of the play these that over the amount of patience well how well it was beautiful and they spoke with me for a very long time and community a lot of things to me I want to ask you about that do she they told me a lot of things but one of the things is to remember the healing capacity that I have in my hand oh I believe that and as they as they were speaking of this golden students of light report on my hand and I was remembering a lot of it they also told me that I can change within me a scroll of life that cannot be taught and cannot be done in a sense you may understand not to in that sense denigrate what you are saying that you all can and in a sense you would not be able to perceive of any knowledge or learn anything lest you first did but now you are at the point where you will be willing to unfurl that's good they often tell me that I have different DNA structure which I've been told before can I stand on that simply that your body is a reflection of your consciousness and not the other way around so therefore when you are willing in that sense to choose to alter to choose different styles of perception you then have physical literal physical corresponding changes this in that sense is simply the degree to which you have been willing to change your consciousness being reflected in your physical vessel so to speak that is perceptible by individuals it is in that sense shall we say an earmark of your willingness to integrate yourself I would like to increase the communication or go right away go right away that I said it that way is that is all there is to it now perhaps we can expand a bit but wish to keep it very simple simply precepts you seem to like small number three steps relax breathe oh wow that is all then perhaps as a nice touch you can add the four step of validate what you get which you already have I was also made aware of my name that will simply be shall we say more of a representative translation into your language of shall we say what you might consider your signature vibration itself your soul essence so I resonate very deeply with that sound of that thank also if you will simply look it up you will find the word Elan which is contained within there to have many meanings that are quite relevant to what you are exploring can you tell me anything about the tones that I heard with the colors in a sense they are simply the audio representation of the overall vibration which many times when the vibrations will be communicated to you in this way it will encompass in that sense more than one physical sense and to you hey I'm greetings to you I'm very excited I have so much like material I want to share others I have time of course in my sharing I don't think but I am I'm gonna follow up on the white brotherhood because I've been receiving some messages from there also oh well what house thing yeah it's well I'll just say the message is I've been getting and I have questions with them is I've been told to build a pyramid oh why how exciting I went yeah and I've been seeking out some sacred sites that are local yeah on earth here because I think that there's the knowledge is there at these sacred sites and in particular it's one at the Dolman that's locally here in Connecticut ice and I think you know tune in on it may I have some questions about it describe well it's a boulder that is on sitting on six supports it's a north sail on all do proceed okay basically I just want to know I don't really think I care too much about the origin of it because I think I know about the time of where I came from and I just believe that the it was created through using the energies of the earth well in a sense well for example using the the tachian energy that Tesla invented years ago I feel like it's using that levitation the powers of it's just confused about a little bit but I'm trying to retain the information and there's so much well simply that which is shall we say essential for you to retain you will simply retain so first of all cease try and allow what needs to be there to be there and what isn't there as to simply allow you to refocus to what is the symbol overall perhaps you can say as a representation of balance in and of itself balance of nature balance and harmony in that sense within reality it is our perception that it was physically put there not as you say through the energy you have mentioned and in that sense that spot will represent to some degree what you sometimes call power spot vortex so it was humanly put there levitated up using other powers there were shall we say ingenious methods of leverage in that particular instance as compared to the great pyramids in Egypt basically you may understand leverage in shall we say methodologies that are no longer in the awareness of your society were utilized for that symbol but many earlier ones what you would label at land in one were in that sense created from what you might call the sonic nullification of gravity in a sense they were played into place by certain musical vibratory pattern this is something that still occurs on your world today in the area you call Tibet. So isn't this a secret that we're trying to re-know the knowledge that will say supposedly save this next generation. Well I understand that much of what you are labeling the quote unquote secret is sitting on the patent shelves of your shall we say special interest. The knowledge is now beginning to diffuse from the mass consciousness itself and will simply begin to come out in so many different individual ways that it will in that sense have too much momentum to be squashed and you will find a great deal of this within the next ten of your needs. So I'm really in this apology I do acknowledge it a lot. May we in that sense ask you a question. Are you attracted to the area you call Bahama. That is a very strong in that sense vortices or vortex area in a sense what you call bimini are you aware of that. That also by the way is in that particular area but a bit sound. But understand that what you call bimini would correspond to physical remnants of that element. I say that was my next question. Not really but you understand the mechanism is that when we are in synchronous accord we simply think similar thoughts at the same time it is as you say a result in automatic synchronicity of unconditional love. Are you prepared? I'm prepared. Now we also in that sense draw your attention to your area you call Central America and shall we say Mayan ruin. You will find should it excite you which is generally the criteria we suggest that you will reestablish many many connections in that area. Okay. It's just that locally I live here and I'm finding these vortices so-called vortexes here. I mean at one this board. Simply began speaking to me by expressing your interest in these types of areas and we were expressing to you in interacting with your consciousness two areas that would perhaps be key to your recognition of certain ideas within you. However not to take away from what you have discovered and we simply suggest you're being willing to go and utilize what you have discovered in whatever way your imagination provides so that you can become self sufficient in that regard. Okay. So we're quickly then back to the boulder. I've seen figures that look like animals to me three different figures in this boulder. Is that just by accident? I don't think so. We will leave that up to you. Well I- It is our perception that it is not. But we will leave that up to you. Wow. It's amazing. I've taken pictures of them they actually look like animals. Oh. A good imagination maybe I don't know. Again when it represents balance it also represents the balance of what you call nature. So you may see within it many reflections from within yourself. And another place I've been is more of a chamber. It's near the same area. And I've- There are extraterrestrial overtones to these chambers in that they resonate in a particular way. Particularly with other chambers that are along certain lines and in that sense provides shall we say a style of interdimensional door. Right. That's what I've been understanding. In this particular place I've been a little afraid to go there. It's dark as full of water. There is nothing within yourself that you can find that you cannot use in a positive way. Simply understand the cave to be representative of what you consider to be the deep dark reaches of yourself. So is this one I'm talking about built by an ancient man or is it just something else? For the purposes of shall we say accuracy a co-created idea. With extraterrestrial overtones but we are speaking out of the chambers not what you label for luck. Right. There will be actual chambers. Are you speaking specifically about the one I'm asking about? That is only one of them. Because I've found others in the same area by accident. Oh by accident. So I was working in this ladies' yard and I was digging in the ground. I found that she freaked out to fill it in and I'm like I didn't want to do that. But I think that's linked to the same one that I'm allowed to have access to. Well you're not wanting to fill it in in that sense. Displays your willingness to begin to view these ideas. Simply shall we say get a flashlight and have a good time. Okay great. Okay. We thank you. We will in that sense perhaps share again. Aye. Aye. Aye. Trust. Aye. All one. Next shedding. A lot. A lot. A lot. A lot. A good spin. A brand new experience for me this week. I finally. No. Another one. I finally got in my heart and soul and experience that you exist. Well perhaps you can say you simply allowed yourself to begin to realize that you are a member. I don't know what to say about it but I wanted to share it with you directly. We thank you for now being willing to view us as you're equal. And along with that came in that opening such a longing to connect with you. You just did. What do you think you are doing right now? All of you. I just feel very mood. I feel so much love. We share that. That is unconditional love. It has a distinct signature. That is what you are feeling. You are centering within yourself and also now allowing yourself to explore the regions of your consciousness that you have formally labeled alien. We simply represent that and your willingness to expand to that degree now simply encompasses us within your reality. That is why we thank you for viewing us as you're equal. Is that all? I have another question. What is our ongoing relationship to you? For example for me, Shira, how much is she involved in my life here? Does she just. To whatever degree you are willing to utilize the connection and no more. In that sense perhaps you can say from her end, colloquially speaking, when in that sense you desire contact, she just happens to have had quote unquote nothing to do at that moment. So it is within the flow of her life. No interruption. Never in that sense are you calling any of us away from what we are doing before we structure our reality to time out shall we say in a purposeful way. She makes the contact from her own accord to me. From time to time, but generally upon your request. Understand that being that she represents a future that you may choose in that sense to unfold into you are in that sense intimately related for you are becoming. So do you understand? Yeah. It was the timing for that next level of that revolution. We will allow you to sit with that and perhaps share it again. Good evening. Good evening. Nice to see you are viewing you again. And you have it. Yeah. I have a sharing of a dream I had recently and it was very strong dream. Oh. It had a dream one other time before but this time it was very strong. And what happened was I appeared to have been in some sort of a village or a community or somewhere and it was dark out. And there was a lake and maybe some mountains and people were running. It seemed as if they were running, if they were scared of something. And I was with a group of people who were looking for whatever was going on and the lights went out in this place that we were in. And I lost the people I was with and I was by myself. And I all of a sudden had a hand come up and touch me. And I knew it wasn't anyone that I knew. And it was an orange being. It was either an orange being or it was someone wearing orange. And when you walked hand in hand and I just didn't have any fear of that. I just was walking with this being but I didn't have anyone around. It was like they were not there anymore in the stream. But the dream was so real. Well thank you. One of the reasons we do so is for your willingness to funnel a particular probable reality in that style so you will then not experience it in your physical world. For understand the gate that you are crossing this evening of your time that will also be represented by tomorrow of your time. On some parallel earth, not the one we are sitting upon right now. And if you choose to remain here you will not experience what I am about to share. But on some parallel earth there will be a catastrophic so to speak interpretation of that energy which can result in many scenarios including what you would label the literal blackening of your planet for a series of days. This is not our perception of your particular math choice of how to in that sense experiences but you gave yourself in that way a chance to have a foot and both reality. So chose to provide a symbol to yourself a fear less symbol to so to speak lead yourself back into colloquially speaking this reality. We time to. Who was the being that I was walking with hand in hand. It will represent for the purposes of this discussion your higher self. And the higher self is orange. In this sense. In this sense. In this sense. Golden. Golden. Very interesting. I have another. I would integrity had wrote a letter to Pearl before he decided to drop out of presidential campaign and I sent them a book and I didn't say to him that the book was necessarily 100% true or not true but the book had information to share related to. Define. Define. The book was called The Ultimate Reception by Commander Act and that's not his real name he was a former military officer working with the area of. Oh was this one of your conspiracy governmental covering up the UFO book. Perhaps that's why he dropped out. And so that's the story goes I sent in the letter with the book. He hasn't responded yet. There is in that sense an expression in your reality. Do not hold your breath. Well I've also thought that the integrity since reading this letter that I'm going to write a few more letters to the other cantaloupe to Bill Clinton in the same vein but a little different scenario. But I'm doing sort of boldness integrity that I feel nothing can stop me from going forward with anything anymore. By the way your sense of moving with integrity for that reason can mean no matter how you do is interpreted. It has on some level a positive impact simply because of your integrity in choosing to do so. Therefore if your intention is of love and life if your intention is of integrity then whatever you create from that intention contains that vibration and can only in that sense get that reality. So therefore perhaps it may not have the effect that you would perhaps expect in quite the way that you think that it will but an effect it will have and it will be if again your intention is loving and positive a loving and positive effect. Now Mr. Farrow has he read my letter? What is it given to him? I don't know immediate access to and obviously were as you say making an earth joke by suggesting that that's why he dropped out. So to speak. I just wish to be clear. Very very clear. Interestingly enough I think this 26 you mentioned as you were sharing with us at the beginning tomorrow is being a very, you know you want to energy I will use the term energy or the mass consciousness let's say people that aren't really in tune with what's going on yes here in this sense who are not in this room the general what's the general population. This particular date has come to the awareness of many as you say perhaps you can call them metaphysical minded beings on your planet and will be celebrated in many different ways. Simply we became aware of it through a question that was asked and precede the gate that your society has co-created. Therefore you will not be the only ones participating on this level. However being that you are again on the front here so to speak you may find being that you have increased your sensitivity collectively and individually that you will feel interesting vibratory physical sensations during portions of your day tomorrow. This will most likely to be occur in the areas that you label the throat and the heart though perhaps to some degree in the sinus area. Now with this invisible imaginary door opening of as we call it of the the. By the way it is our perception that there is a physical analog to the opening of the door so though it may extend into your imagination as well there are physical overtones energy wise of this gateway. Physical overtones can you go into that a little bit when you can you stand on that. It is a particular alignment shall we say of energy a particular alignment of intentions that will in that sense be physically perceptible therefore it is literally a manifestation of fluid electromagnetic fluid within shall we say the electromagnetic fluid of your planet itself. When in that sense there are changes that you would label electromagnetic this particular instance is an example of consciousness in that form. You are generally sensitive to these types of electromagnetic changes upon your planet in those aforementioned areas heart sinus and to some degree. Your ship is in the neighborhood meaning you said you're in the solar system. Hey. You're not within the atmosphere of the earth right now. Are you heading towards the earth. Not at this time. Are you planning to beat around the earth at any particular point in time. Shall we say yes and sometimes within what you would label your physical atmosphere itself. Well this would be a curry. Oh I don't know. It is not occurring right now and I am merely concerned with the next. Exactly. So does people. Right. Are there any others in this doorway opening that the doorway is also a way for. There are many other societies physically observing as well. The doorway allows for physical contact a lot easier than it would have been for the door. Like if I don't open the door and the other person is on the other side of the door they can't come in unless they open it. Right. In a sense. Understand it is more a gateway that perhaps you can say your planet is passing through rather than a door that you need open or close. So like the physical beings can actually physically interact. But perhaps this will be of the system. That is not entirely the point. The point is establishing your connection with your family. And being willing to embody and get in touch with define who you are. For what will enable us to act in accord with you face to face is acting in a way where we can literally perceive each other. So perhaps if you will turn within tomorrow of your time though you perceive your vision is external you will perhaps see more internal. I have one final question and I have a friend in Mount Riga up in northwest part of the state who is a park ranger. And his question was back last year towards the winter and early spring he had something with his teeth where he had spots on his teeth. And he said something happened after I had been there after I left a few months later. It was not like thunder but it was clear nights when he heard sounds that he used the term thunder for it. But it was not thunder. And also other things occurred such as he had a bad history with his teeth and also his teeth are now perfectly okay. I mean all of a sudden there is no problems with his teeth and everything is totally different and he cannot forget what is going on. And this time we find we have no awareness of it. In other words I don't know. But perhaps in interacting directly with that individual I would then have the need to know and then have the knowledge to communicate. But at this time we simply have nothing to add except perhaps now he will be more willing to take a bite out of life. Okay because all right well I'll get some more information about that and try to get them to one of these events. I'm all. Thank you very much. And to you over there. May I? No. I. Be. And to you. Greeting. Thank you. Place running. Did you in that sense participate earlier with the symbol of balanced the large rock? Were you present at the beginning of this intellectual? Oh. Perhaps the individual that we shared this with will in that sense point out to you a particular area you may wish to visit. Do proceed. Well, um, the other day I finally gave up. That's it. I can't fix this. Well. Individual over there thinking about control. Listen up. Procing. I really like control because of the vehicle and the ability to prepare it to the dealership. So in a sense you may say that by letting go you ultimately gain control and the desired effect. Because you told me to do a few things and get it ready because it's just going to take it up. And I tried one last thing because he was just going to replace it anyway and I said, well what the hell. And I started up and ran fine. Yeah, I did one. And then that. That's it. In a sense, yeah. But that is the rule, not the exception in your area. Well, I just think of it because... It's because you look at the issues surrounding the physical reflection rather than keeping your consciousness in the reflection itself. And as in a sense you continue to integrate the ideas that we have discussed and that you will discover without discussing it with anybody. You will then find, shall we say, the other two bikes to come along as well. Yeah, let's go to the other thing please. Oh, what? I'm not doing this. Oh, thank you. That's all. Oh, that is quite important. Thank you. Very. Shh. Shh. Oh, there you go. Clean it. Hi, Alon. Greetings. I'd like to be with you again. Yes. And thank you for inviting us into this association of worlds. Well, thank you in that sense for attending. For many of you have already, from time to time, acted like and therefore, by extension, been a member. I, in that sense, now wish to share that with you. Several weeks ago, I had some periods of negativity and began to feel sort of overwhelmed by things and then began to feel not too well. And did you feel out of control? Yeah. What did you do? I had some things happen through synchronicity that I got my messages from and discovered that what I was doing was not saying in the moment. I was rushing through what I was doing to get to the next thing, rushing through that to get to the next thing. Now, I wanted to pause you here for but a moment for, again, that other individual. A lot of times what you will perceive to create fear is again projecting an unpreferred future. In that moment, you are still in the now moment, but you are creating an unpreparental future in that now moment and having the emotional reaction to that expectation. So that is another reason you may find when you are actually feeling the fear and are willing to go through what you believe that you may also understand and in that sense identify as to whether or not you are fearing something which is not in that sense inherent in the moment. Which very often will then re-center you to that moment. Do proceed. Well, I would say. Thank you for your synchronicity. You're welcome. I started to closely watch what was happening and what I was thinking and was able to trace this particular belief system that I believe has been governing a lot of my life for a long time. Do you? There are many others that share it as well. One where you are not staying in the moment. You are speaking about what is coming next and you are hurrying to get to what you are doing to get to the next thing and to get to the next thing. And I was able to stop doing it and I haven't done it since. And it is that simple. That simple. Simply making the choice. And I had some interesting things happen to give me my clue. Something I heard from someone. How I reacted to losing my car keys. How I reacted to making mistakes in my baking which is very serious. And I noticed that I thought I wasn't being careful and I wasn't being patient. And it's wonderful how seeing this. Once I saw it stop and I don't do it now. I haven't done it since I saw it. And that is also again what frustration in and of itself is. It is not being in the moment. It is assuming that something out there is better than what's right here. And when you allow yourself to see what is right here, you then give yourself the opportunity to appreciate why you created it and how it serves you. And how it enables you to unfold according to Preferland. Is that all? I have one question for Henrietta who is the medical counselor at Southbury who has the place. Oh. Okay. And she wanted to know if in the ship that's over her house are there any beings from Massathon? No. Thank you, Luon. Thank you. Over there. Hi. Greetings. As you did. I really enjoyed the invitation to the association. Well, thank you. I already felt that I was a member all along. Thank you. And have been living those concepts that you shared with us. I've been playing many segments of these interactions on the radio to make other people on our planet aware of the great joy. Allowing other people to match that wavelength. With your society, it is very beautiful idea to us. Open. And I don't really have any questions. That was in and of itself a statement. And we thank you for your willingness to simply be who you are and with no hesitation be willing to share that with us. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Over there. Be ready. I have a couple of questions, Luon. Oh. So last time that I was here, I mentioned to the person for the next meeting that I was having trouble meditating, which I still am. But she gave me a couple of ideas and I went home and the very next day I did what she has said. And I had something happen to me that has not happened since and never happened before. Well, I was. But I wish that I was. I think I get afraid now that I don't. Anyway, let me pay what happens. Oh. I felt like all of a sudden there was this young man. I was on top of a mace and there was this man, this young man sitting in front of me. And he had his back to me. And I never felt such love that I felt a connection with this human being that I never felt before ever. Not recently. Well, I'm not in my sense. So I tried to get him to turn around. He did, but I really couldn't see who he was. It is in that sense a soul with which you are very directly connected. Perhaps for the purposes of this particular life you can say that you are mother to son energy in a sense. You can understand that he has chosen for the time being to function as a guide. And in that sense is one of the strongest symbols that you have created called forth from within you that will in that sense enhance and be willing to in that sense play with you in what you label your meditation. So if you will simply continue to utilize that symbol to extend that type of an invocation and invitation to that particular individual soul if you will, you will find an aid in that sense to your meditations and also can ask many of the questions that you have directly to them. Simply listen for the answer and perhaps they will surprise you. You are an Indian or the purposes of identification in what you have shared the presentation of the energy was in that vein representing a connection to a particular set of past lives as Native American India. But there are more ancient ties than that which you can explore directly with. Okay, thank you. Oh, thank you. And thank you. Yes, this morning when my husband and I got up, we discovered that our mailbox had been stolen and I got special. Well, whoever took it really took care. It wasn't vandalized. It was very carefully taken apart. And I felt scared because I thought that why have this happened? Well, perhaps you have the nicest mailbox in the neighborhood. No, that's not true. You can lighten up a little bit, you know. You won't. What was, did we track the person to come and do that for a minute? In a sense, that does not excuse, shall we say, the perpetrator for the act which in that sense was out of his own integrity. But it allows you in that sense to look at many things, one of them being the idea of being willing to trust synchronicity. Also being willing to forgive whatever symbol in that sense you create. In understanding that nothing is extraneous. Here you give yourself an example of something which would seem overwhelmingly extraneous. But now you get in that sense to apply what we have been discussing with you in understanding that nothing is and looking at how that symbol relates directly to you. Now, to some degree, the symbol of your mailbox will in that sense represent your receptivity and willingness to accept communication. So now that you are beginning to look at this, perhaps you will in that sense buy a new mailbox which is more reflective of that willingness, perhaps with a bigger door. But the idea is you can look at the symbology of what it means to you. Well that's what I thought, but I couldn't figure out why I had decided to have this happen to me. What does it now force you to do? I have to use a preference. What else? Try and figure out why it happened. What else? I think this is what they do with communication. What else? I'm doing the mailbox. And therefore you may assume that in the process of doing so, it would be who you to keep your eyes open. For you have now forced yourself in a sense to be in a particular place at a particular time. Trust that. Keep your eyes open. Okay. All right. Yeah, I have one more question. The other night I went to a lecture given by a young man who talked about the Hopi Prophecy. And a lot of material was given out of that lecture that I found rather disturbing, one of which was a map, a channel map of the United States. And it shows that within a short period of time, at least this is what the genan that we were going to have such so many devastating things happen to us that we were going to California and the body of Utah. This is one train of thought. City? That is not our perception, by the way. You understand, in the days where many of these predictions were rendered, they were accurate sensing of imminent change. But the societies that existed with the issuance of these predictions only believe that change could occur, particularly drastic change, with A, shall we say breaking down of the old structure. So therefore, any shall we say energy which would seem to sense change would then have the society plug in their way that they would perceive is the only way that change could take place. Yes, that is one way, but obviously not the only way. We have also to some degree discussed the idea that there are many, many, many an infinite number of parallel dimensional earth. So you may understand that if such a notion exists, so does such a reality. But by your becoming aware of it, and your shall we say not preferring it, and simply choosing a new not out of fear, but out of preference and out of that choice being representative of who you are, this sets up your vibration so that the earth so to speak, that you are on will simply not contain that style of cataclysmic change. Changes there will be and to some degree you will find some physical changes upon your planet, even on your earth, but they will not experientially affect you. Is that clear? Me, me in particular or on earth. Now in this room, and individuals who choose in that sense to partake in the transformation in a positive way, which is an option. Was there something else, however? I have a niece who lives out in California, who I care a lot about, and she has just moved to San Francisco, and I had read somewhere that there was a prediction that there would be an earthquake in and around May the next year. There is a degree of likelihood behind that. About that date? So that it would behoove me to then say something to her about maybe losing at that time? Or taking a vacation? But again, it is not our perception that it will fall into the ocean now. Okay, but all right, but around the May 8th is right. Thank you very much. As you. Shurrying. Hey, scream out. Hi. Greetings. Hi. Hi. Thank you. Thank you for being purple this evening. I love that color. Oh, wonderful. It's a good color. It's a good color. It represents the opening of your crown. Richard and I are playing with words at our classes and adding to our linguistic file. One of the words that we've been playing with of late is context. Oh. And I was wondering if you would give us your definition of context. Oh. Context is simply a framework, a frame of reference in the overall arbitrary nature of reality. Therefore you will create within the overall very loose framework particular points of view, particular frames of references, particular structures of your beliefs that have you perceive reality in a particular way and therefore a context through which to experience your reality through these beliefs, emotions and thoughts. Thank you. That's helpful. Relevance in a sense. Or relativity. I'd like to also ask about before when you spoke at the entry. By the way, to extrapolate. I think can be in context relevant to who you are but out of context simply not relevant to who you are. So therefore when you change, when you shift your reality, it is not that you owe reality is no longer there. It is simply out of context with your new reality and therefore not experience in your new reality. Thank you. You talked about the electrochemical field. Electromagnetics. When you're talking about the sensors. Electrochemical in that sense, your first five, what you typically call sensors, are electrochemical in nature. What is the difference between the biomechanics, the electrochemical and the electromagnetics field? In terms of the physical body, the emotional, the mental and spiritual body. Relevance. The electrochemical field is what we perceive to be our five senses and we discover that they are not necessarily in that sense the electrochemical field. They are shall we say the product of electrochemical reactions so to speak. In that sense. They are electrochemical in nature. Their mechanism, their physical mechanism is electrochemical. Whereby there is in that sense the transfer in some chemicals throughout what you call your brain but there is also the electrical component to it as well. Whereas the two additional senses, your sense of in that sense spatial orientation and your sense of vibrational discernment are purely electromagnetics. And having that sense not for chemical shall we say corresponding compounds so to speak. Okay. Is knowing this in the other... Residential. It is simply shall we say all encompassing. What then makes up the bio-magnetics field? What sense fits in the bio-magnetics field? Not so much the idea of a sense but one of the many manifestations of your physical reality for you. Grade A so to speak yourself from non-physical reality into physical reality. And literally have quasi-physical aspects about yourself. In a sense you can say your electromagnetic field in a sense is the periphery through which your non-physicality manifests. It is so to speak the ether in between. So to speak. Very closely. Okay. That's the electromagnetic. What's the bio-magnetic? When we say bio-magnetic we mean electromagnetic field of your own body. Perhaps you can say electromagnetic. Okay. Thank you. At this time we will pause for a short break of 10 to 15 of your minutes of counting and resume contact at that time.
