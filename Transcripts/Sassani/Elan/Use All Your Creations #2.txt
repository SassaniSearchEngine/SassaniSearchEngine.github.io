 I'll say before we continue, allow me to discuss one thing. It has been shared at the last task of the interaction, the idea of abundance and the idea of individual living above substance level. It's a power to explain that as you begin to transform into your new ideas from your old, more limiting belief, very often one of the results of your willingness to move in such a way will be a little bit of a shaking up of your old reality. Now very often this in itself stems from a belief that in order to build up a new reality you need to tear down the old. This is not necessarily what need occur, it is one perspective one way. So individuals may find themselves as they begin to take back their power from time to time exploring many issues regarding and surrounding the idea of abundance. From our perspective as a definition abundance is simply your ability to do what you need to do when you need to do it, money is one form but there are many different ways through which you can express who it is you are. Because again many individuals will choose to shake themselves up a bit and do it in an exciting way, though they do not always interpret it as exciting when this is the issue. You can understand that should you find yourself in such a situation where you feel that you are perhaps above subsistence of barely, that you can still proceed in a positive way, you can still use all your creations even that. We find that there is a tendency with individuals who are experiencing shall we say self-created difficulty surrounding abundance for them to continually focus in and hone in on what that lack of what they perceive their abundance to be does not allow them to do. And so therefore when the issue comes up of looking at the ideas and beliefs surrounding abundance very often it is accompanied by a negative interpretation. And remember as we had opened the interaction by saying all ideas are neutral. Your willingness to label them as negative will give you a negative effect. Now how you can apply this in a positive way with the subject you label abundance, sometimes taking the form of money is first of all to broaden your definition to understand that abundance is the ability to do what you need to do when you need to do it. And perhaps the path of least resistance will not be money. If it is it will be there. If it is not that tells you that there is something right in front of you that you can act on that does not require that money but will still get you where you want to be. Again as a reminder you are choosing at this point in your existence to explore physical reality as physical beings and the ultimate manifestation of your intention your belief are your actions. So therefore where you apply that action and the beliefs that are behind your application of the actions will determine your effect. If you are acting from the perspective of I can't do this I can't do that you hold yourself back and in general do nothing. Therefore perhaps as an assistant tool you can utilize the phrase what can I do right now and if you will utilize that to ground yourself in any given moment factoring out by convention what it is you cannot do at that moment you will begin to act from what is available and you will then show yourself how you have the ability which you already have it is automatic it is inherent to do what you need to do when you need to do it. So when you find yourself saying I don't have the money I can't do this I can't do that. All right that is all well and good. Now at least give yourself the opportunity to explore the other side of the same coin and now that you have made a nice little item I would say what it is you cannot do begin to look at what can I do that will always bring you back to center that will enable you to begin to reestablish the flow that you stop so to speak when you are contemplating and constantly submerging your consciousness in what I can't do. It is all a matter of perspective when you begin to show again the ultimate manifestation of your intention by action that you simply know you always have the ability you will begin to show yourself how you have that ability and it can be most obvious for again if you cannot act upon it that is not the thing if you cannot do it that is not the idea what can you do what can you act upon it. So therefore again what can I do will always center you back to looking at what is right in any given here and now moment and your willingness to then move in positive action allow yourself to see what you can do and here's again the idea choosing from those choices utilizing the one that excites you the most from what is available this will begin your ecstatic explosion of coincidence and synchronous therefore we thank you. Okay. Over there. Hi. Good. I'm experiencing a lot of exhaustion and sort of breath. All right what are you resisting and that you feel is representative of who you are that you are denying doing. You're going to ask. Oh thank you very much. Because I'm a few are psychic as well. I know I know that the case I just I'm I'm a bit concerned about it because it's all concerned over the last little allow you to look at the belief but again utilize what we just shared perhaps there is a reason that we have shared and in the given moment what can you do and give it shall we say a go to choose with your excitement from what is available even if you do this in a relatively short amount of time. In fact three of your day you will find enough of a momentum to have the incentive to continue but when you do not do what you feel is representative of who you are you are literally resisting your self you are resisting who you chose to be because this one told you this this one told you that everyone knows you should grow up. These are societal notions that you have unconsciously bought into we've now made it conscious and you have the choice to decide and again as a reminder in a given moment what can I do choose with your life you will find you will have all the energy you then need but as you resist yourself you create friction and the friction can be a bit tiring all this resistance from having hard time being decisive exactly what it is because I have so much going on in my life right now you are having quite an easy time being decisive you are simply not deciding according to what represents who you are you are deciding something else you always decide you always commit each and every one of you always do what we are seeking others consciously beginning to decide according to preference and excitement with integrity there is no shall we say rusty myth in this department for you already always decide. Well I am interested in tonight when I go to sleep I am interested in showing this problem and I go right ahead and we are not being patronizing that is how simple it is simply utilize what we are seeking up in the moment and it will just be obvious and provide whatever proof you will need to continue to do so. And you assist me in that in my sleep? Hey, you will make it. Definitely keep your eyes open. I am definitely asking for that. In my reality my awakeness I am confused about it and I am always confused. Well, confusion is simply beginning to look at many different aspects of yourself perhaps taking them apart and refusing them together and in that sense is part of redefining yourself. We simply say pleasant dreams. Oh, that is most important to me right now. Then we will be there. Thank you. I asked you something else to begin to sleep. I just moved into a new house, a new apartment. And it is hard for me because I am moving into a new space where I am alone. Let us put it that way. Oh, nothing wrong with that? I like it. I am excited about it. You could tell a bit more. Oh, I am very excited about this idea. Alright. No. Okay. Wind out of the film. Oh, then we take the next boat. And again, pun intended, go with the flow. Okay. Relax. Enable yourself to understand that you have created this. Now begin to look at it from the aspect of enjoying your creation. Look at the advantages in it and how it serves you rather than concentrating on what is a drag about it. Allow yourself to at least glean the positive reasons again that you have created. And allow it to also be an opportunity to nurture your primary relationship with yourself. Or if you truly understand that you are complete as you are, you will not be alone. Simply there may be times you wish to share that completeness, but it will not be out of a need for an external fulfillment. It will be out of the simple desire to share your completeness. Okay. So perhaps you can go home, make yourself some dinner, and have a party, but don't invite anyone. That answer my question. Thank you. Oh, there. Hey. Nice. Great. Good to see you again. And you guys. Well, really bothered when I started when I started talking about, not even talking about doing all the comfortable. Thank you for relaxing. And you know, I'm not going to do this. I'm going through a phase of my life where I am more actively pursuing what I want by energetic, right? My life. You know, feelings about things like stability and sensitivity. And are you willing to begin to do these things? Well, I have been. Oh, well, there is a distinction between doing them and pursuing them, which assumes they keep running away just out of your breath. So look even at your wording and your verbiage and just begin on whatever level you are comfortable to do what you can. What can I do? Yeah. Very fun. You know, I have some beautiful shoes. I have fun. How exciting, congratulations. Why did you say that? He said that because fear is again an emotion. All emotions are windows to your belief. So therefore, this is an opportunity when you feel that fear to decide what you believe to be and in general again, fear is a representation of the reading that a reality that you do not prefer is most likely. So why would you believe that? And what is it that you believe? What is the question? It says that we say ideas to look at and if you wish in that sense to answer them here, go right ahead. If not, go home and have fun. I am hungry, but I have a living in an obvious experience to hold on. You've lived thousands of lives. That is, shall we say, a very good resume. What is it if in that sense you are comfortable sharing in a crowd that you see? I fear that what I feel as far as I can do much more. I fear that what I perceive in my excitement is negative. What happens? I never learned how to do any validity in all of my feelings. Very good. Now you are understanding what excitement you are understanding, some of the societal expectations that you have utilized to hold yourself back from that excitement. Now what? Do you wish to do the exciting thing? Can you have your name? No, actually. I do like to think that there is some part of it in the whole world. Well again, perhaps it will assist you not to view yourself in part and relabel that has choices, choices within the one whole youth. If you had a magic wand sent to the rabbit and make a wish, would you do the exciting thing? No. What is that thing? Can you share it? I would, but I wouldn't just, I would have it if I was not doing it. Well, habit is something that you do, that you do not realize that you are doing. Once you know you are doing it, you don't have a habit anymore and it is now a choice. So therefore you need not perpetuate holding yourself back from your exciting thing using that as an excuse any longer. What is the exciting thing? I'm sorry, that's where I'm confused. I only have vague ideas. I'll share the vague ideas. I would like my life to be more about, I mean I want to move away from, you know, a pursuit. First of all, again, we are thinking about what it is you are excited about, not what you are not excited about and moving away from. What are you walking towards? What is it that truly excites you more than any other thing? Well, that's actually, well, that's just the, my, my, my openness to being open. But is there a particular thing you wish to do? Is there a particular service you wish to render? How can you express that openness? Do you really think about it for a while? Do you understand that what we are discussing with you is defining your excitement, allowing yourself to tune in on what it is that moves you and at least define it. At least understand what it is conceptually. If there is something that you are holding your back yourself from doing, what is that thing? If it comes up right now, share it, if not, then utilize some of the ideas that we have shared to explore it and share it at another time. And if that other time is within this interaction, please share. There have been certain communication that have occurred between us, that are on perhaps what you might call some of these other levels that you create yourself to be. So in that sense, keep your mind and your consciousness open and you will begin to define these ideas. Be willing to simply define them. That will be the first step. Then you will be able to, in a sense, see certain ways you can act toward it, but there must be an it to begin with. There are things that excite you. So begin to scan. All right. Happy thank you. Sh a lot, good evening in regards to my mom and dad creating real reality with their health. Is there something more I can do to be stronger myself about their choices? Well, in a sense your willingness to consciously create your own reality will be a sparkly example for them. You see, you cannot convince other individuals of these ideas. And again, even the mere act of attempting to convince usually sends out the message that you do not believe in yourself. So your willingness to simply establish your own criteria, your own excitement, and begin to act on it and get the results will simply have you be the strongest symbol a living example. And individuals rather than you needing to convince them that your reality works so much better will simply see how well it is working and say, what are you doing? It seems to work for you. I am interested in finding that out. And they will ask you. And that is the most receptive time for them to appreciate what you are sharing. But again, one other notion. We had mentioned earlier in which to recap so that it is clear that because you create your own reality and they create their own reality, you can never be responsible to other individuals or rather for other individuals. You can only be responsible to them by being responsible for yourself. And that will take the form of getting in touch with who you are and being willing to boldly with integrity fulfill that excitement, fulfill that passion. That is being responsible for yourself, which then provides an example to them and is responsible to them, taking their responsibility for them does them no favor. I think we have been doing being responsible for myself right now, but more than also you can share some of the other ideas that we had discussed in terms of the reasons for creation. Without blaming, allowing individuals to re-assume responsibility for their reaction need not be accompanied by blame for what they have created. That is not the point of letting individuals know that they create their own reality. What the point is is to give them the opportunity to begin to do so consciously according to preference, but berating themselves or experiencing guilt will only stop them dead in their tracks and not allow them to continue. Thank you. I am not sure what blame that we share this idea. Am I correct in feeling my mom's condition is in response to her anger and her fear? Most directly, yes. And can I assist her somehow to make her transition easier? Where did you just answer that? Do you believe in that sense in the eternal nature of each and every one of your souls? Yes. So simply you can share that with her and one other little kid that may come in handy. I think you have a sense. Oh, then allow us to add this as well. In this reality, you have a belief. And there is a lag period between the having of the belief and the manifesting of the reality. The reason for this is that in this physical reality, you are exploring time and you are exploring timing. So by definition, there is at least at first a lag. When you quote unquote pass over into, shall we say, the other side, so to speak, you are no longer in the same definitional physical reality. You are to some degree still associated very strongly with physical reality, but in a more astral type of state, you are literally a thought form and a sea of thought energy. So therefore, what occurs when you pass over in that sense is whatever you believe will occur. So once you are in that particular aspect of your consciousness, there is no lag between the having of the thought and the creating of the experience. So therefore, if an individual understands this, it can be of great assistance to them for they can look at what their beliefs are. If they like those beliefs, all will end. If they do not, then you give them the opportunity to begin to transform them and begin to very literally pass through that door, eyes open, choosing the experience they prefer rather than being at the whims of their unconscious beliefs. So that makes sense. Yes. So I can share with her that she is ageless, deathless, and eternal. And when she dies, what she will experience is what she believes to be most likely. So therefore, she can get in touch with those beliefs now if she wishes that to be conscious. And if her beliefs are... And if heaven and hell is a belief, that will be what they... At least four times. So right now, I guess for my own well-being, what they are going through is their choice. And to me, she just knows that I am doing the best I can to be there with her. Yes, and your willingness to be of assistance without compromising who you are. Is observatory them and allows what they are experiencing to be of service to you. For it allows you to look at the issues they are looking at from your point of view without having to create the same effect. But still you get to explore these ideas. Individuals who create this ease also on some level do so for those around them. Also to synchronistically learn many lessons. So yes. They give me many lessons. Oh, one other thought. We have discussed again that fear is believing that a reality that you do not prefer is most likely. So therefore perhaps you can begin to explore that to whatever degree she is willing. But allow us also to put a definition for anger. Anger is an alignment. It is a rush in fact of alignment. It allows you to see in relation to a particular event or circumstance or relationship or person or thing how you stand. But true anger only lasts 10 to 15 of your second. That is all it takes for you to become aligned. Be aware. This is me. This is not me. Beyond the 10 to 15 of your second, it is invalidation and judgment of the thing you have defined to not be you and you need not do that. That once it is pointed out can then be a choice to either continue to do that or not do that. Again, you can always establish I prefer this. I do not prefer this. Therefore, I will do the thing I prefer and understand the thing I do not prefer is perhaps valid for someone else or all symbols or valid. But when you say I prefer this and put a whole lot of energy in saying that the thing I do not prefer absolutely sinks and has no place in my reality, that is where the effect is prolonged. And that is where individuals in a sense eat themselves up from the inside out. So they are showing that the acknowledgement which is as a rules vary asps as possible. So this is the kind here, although the m Bye tips are always done to exploit any change for parties. us in this way. And who you? Though perhaps to her, our assistance would appear as a long lost relative. Whatever it is, she strongly believes we'll be how she will perceive the energy. We can. Greetings. And who you? Incoristically, I also want to share some thoughts about death. All right. As you know, our civilization to a great extent sees death as the ultimate tragedy. Oh, if you say so. Some individuals perhaps do. High number do. The ones who do not understand the eternal nature of their beliefs. About two and a half years ago, that I start believing and knowing that each one of us is infinite and eternal. Good times. And so what I find often these days is that when somebody dies, I feel a little discomfort because I don't feel the tragedy in the sorrow and all that that maybe they feel that the person is particularly close to me or not. And I find myself that we're uncomfortable as I say, not pushing my beliefs to strongly. And that sort of contradiction of being true to myself and what I believe, but also respecting their beliefs. Oh, well, again, you can always share your belief in a loving way. And if you do so, it will never infringe on their beliefs. It will never be saying, this is correct. What you are saying is wrong. It will simply be saying, well, here's a perspective for you to take around then in a loving way presented. If it has a significant to them, they will enter into an exchange and a dialogue with you. If it does not, they will make it most obvious. And you will have in that sense made your communication. I was very pleased to see the current issue of life's magazine as the cover article on your death experience. And I consider it a rather important article. One of many changes going on in our culture is making it all more aware of some of the things that some of us believe so strongly. Also understand, some of the time, the reason that individuals will create what you sometimes label grief will be because they feel that they can no longer interact with the individual. But this is also only a definition. They are still in that sense existing and can interact with you, though, obviously, the nature and style of the interactions will now be a bit different. So if you are willing to even understand that you can communicate with these individuals, you can even transform that style of grief and communicate with them on whatever level you will allow. Just monosys, well, that is. Just a question. The one question I'm meeting up to after all this is could you elaborate on what happens on your planet at the time when somebody quote dies, how is it handled physically as the person take a long time? No, no, there is simply no corresponding symbol that you would label illness or disease in any way. It is a conscious decision as all of our decisions and all of our attitudes and all of our expressions. It is spontaneous. It is in the moment. And being that we in that sense are not as attached. So to speak to the physical body as being the only reality, the literal effect when an individual shall we say chooses such a passage will be what you would probably term again, this is only close, the immediate and rapid decay of the physical form, being that the physical form as an expression of the consciousness once the consciousness has transformed past the mood for that particular expression, the expression dissolved in a sense more rapidly. Therefore, we do not bury the dead. Someone who's you are not the sound of God. Are you feeling normal communication with that spirit? That will depend upon the particulars and the and the instance of shall we say occurrence for if there is a reason for us to be in touch, it will in that sense continue in general, the synchronicity of the situation where an individual decides that they no longer have a need for that particular physical aspect of their reality will also correspond again coincidentally with our particular understanding that we no longer need to interact with that individual in that way, but also again understand that we are in communication with souls, if you will, and the in between state also prior to birth. Therefore, when in a sense individuals decide to as you say conceive in this way, we are then consciously in touch with the soul who is not yet a child is still in a sense an adult, again loosely speaking, and begin the dialogue in that fashion. So that would usually be the point at which communication would be re-established. At this point in time, your civilization are some of your being guiding and then transitioning on the fifth density, meaning non-physical. It occurs from time to time for it will always be the choice of each individual, but our particular exploration as yours is will be to move into fifth density, which is the first level of non-physical existence as a society, as a whole, as a bubble, if you will, of many conscious methods. Thank you very much. As you should. Hey, I'm I think this is telling as it existed, I was talking to a medieval man, and I wanted to bring some say your new minorities are familiar with the channel. In terms of specific, there is no shall we say corresponding vocabulary in the channel. In terms of channeling in that sense, this has been occurring for many many thousands of years upon your climate. Do you have a particular interest in channeling yourself? Yes, I do, and I'm researching the history of actually of channeling, and I was wondering as I move in books ways in which it was misinterpreted that I might find and if there's actual channeling, that would call possession. Well, again, do understand from our perspective, what you are calling classical possession is simply impossible. For each individual does create their own reality, and even if they're worthy idea of another entity or consciousness entering the body, which is shall we say extremely rare, it is on a higher self level by agreement of the individual, but most often what takes the form of what you label possession are individuals who are expressing aspects of their own consciousness that are not socially acceptable aspects, that are then therefore shall we say shunting the responsibility and creating shall we say a separate identity which in a sense is not separate. For our perspective, any of these types of arrangements can only take place by agreement on the higher self level. So therefore, if the exploration was of extreme victimhood, there is room for such an agreement, but again, on the ultimate level, it would be by agreement, so not really against the overall will of any given higher self. So that helps. Yes, I was wondering how long it ends to you from your planet, chemical channeling. Only recently, only shall we say approximately nine or ten of your years, but understand even in as far back as your Egyptian period, there was contact with other societies. One of them would be what you would label extraterrestrial star systems theory SIRIUS. Therefore, energy from that particular system was channeled very often misinterpreted and filtered by individuals in that particular era. Or that would be one example. There have been throughout your history, many connections with extraterrestrial society as well as some of the actual levels of consciousness. And therefore, that is why you will find a cholera or a wide variety of styles of channeling. Some of them will be quote unquote earthly in origin, others will be extra celestial in origin. I was wondering if Joan of Arr type had read that she spoke in different voices and I was learning a schmooly Our perception is that that style of channeling was from her own higher self, and to some degree a direct tapping in to what you would call all that is or what you label God. Along with the process of the Old Testament, the example of channel. So, when someone in these four inner statements thus say of the Lord God, Jehovah, that implies that they are communicating something that they receive from another store. But that store can also be other people, things that rang through with them and then simply presenting it in this way. Most generally, they would not classically be what you label channeled and would simply be individuals with extremely strong connections to all that is. Or shall we say other manifestations of the Christ consciousness itself, which is the mass portion of your mass consciousness that is unconditionally loving. Is your what is your viewpoint on Prophet's wife Isaiah, a CEO, people who came for us amongst their people and gave their people specific directions. You know, the Lord wants this, if you do this, it's going to be something else, still do something else. We're going with these people in contact with a God Jehovah, with a contact with a terrestrial. In general, what you would call God or all that is, but understand, their ability to bring through any information will always be dependent upon their own set of beliefs. So therefore, very often shall we say that information could be colored by individuals, then also understand the removal for other individuals would witness this, speak to other individuals who would then write it down. So it is quite removed from the original presentation. Your particular individual, you are labeling as zickeal in that sense, had extraterrestrial connections and hence the wheel in the sky. Is he? That is simply one particular translational representation of all that is. And in a sense, the word itself was in this translation. The original word was Yahweh. But the time during which Yahweh communicated with the Jewish people, representing a specific era of development in mankind, what is that development guided by, quote, all that is directly involved in some degree, but each individual still has free will. So therefore, much again of what you are getting are through the interpreted belief systems of the indigenous population at the time, many of which were steep in fear. In what specific degree, how much interaction took place during that time? Would extraterrestrial civilization speaking to influence the forces of development that were taking place on planet Earth? Very little. It was more sharing and exchange, if you will, observation to some degree. Very little interference, but there was the rendering in many portions of your historical picture of certain technology. So we don't, we don't have a scenario where action stress is coming down in this space craft, or not in this space craft, but communicating specific individuals, communicating to them that they are the die or they all are this or Galway, and to go forth amongst their people and teach the explainer. That's your point of view is not what the past is. In that particular instance, no, there have been misinterpretations of extraterrestrial entities by individuals, but again, they were their interpretations and not the intentions. The intentions of the extraterrestrial civilizations that have interacted with your planet have been for the most part, non-interference. Well, I have the question a bit. How much, how much have our religion, okay, where are our religions come from? Are they creations of, are they directed to people who they know? They are creations of your own society. Many of them are, shall we say, methodologies by which many individuals may congregate, and in that sense communicate with all that isn't in a common way, but they're also then became in the nature of the style of some of the explorations of your society at the time, shall we say, higher architectural intervention by you man who then began to utilize many of these ideas in shall we say, somewhat of an oppressive and suppressive way to maintain a particular power base rather than actually enabling each individual to unfold into their own power. They perceived individuals unfolding into their own power as a threat to their own power base, and this is largely shall we say some of the outcropping that you now call religion, though it is not true across the board. What does religion touch in man that allows him to reach a state of fanaticism where he would kill for his belief? Well, in that sense it is a manifestation of fear and not understanding the direct relationship to all that is, and certainly not understanding all other entities to be, shall we say, part of one thing. So there is the idea that they exist within a reality, and that not that the reality exists within them, and then they create, as we had again, already discussed, a perceived helplessness which then has them clawing their way so to speak to a perceived power. Were we seated here on this planet with the assistance of three offices of some of the director of civil society? From our perception in the way that you mean no, you seated yourself for your own purposes, and you were in that sense being eternal, connected to other star systems prior to the inception of the mass consciousness onto this planet. So in a sense, you can say extraterrestrially related, but not planted from another source, you planted yourself to explore certain things. And is it our own higher selves or our over souls that are guiding our development? Not so much guiding, but shall we say experiencing your development through you. The bottom of our head is to be able to catch their hands off our development and yes, but made many appearances in many forms which have shall we say left much room for misinterpretation. Thank you. And one moment over there, Benet. I have a personal question, I have to do with my physicality. What? Yes, have you up till now been more reliant upon your analytical side than you're into it. I would say generally yes. Oh, you are beginning to awaken in the sense that into it is side. Now physically, this is represented by what you would call your right brain, which controls the left side of your body. So simply, you need not do this in a tumultuous fashion. You can understand there are certain bodily adjustments. Then it will prove that it works. Again, we do not mean to be vague, but you have presented it in a vague way. If you take the concept in a quiet to specific situation, that is when it will be most obvious that what we are sharing has never. Is there something else? I just want to ask you about a method of a therapy which is called voice dialogue. And I wondered if you had any comment on that too. We found it to be very helpful in just getting in touch with all the many aspects. I know you're going to sit on separate out yourself, but we do have unconscious aspects of ourselves and more conscious aspects of ourselves, which all have different voices. And the idea is to access each one of these voices to more fully understand those aspects. We find that to be quite positive. And again, rather than parts of yourself, simply choices that are within you, and it would be most beneficial to allow open dialogue of all the choices in that sense. So that was seen in what you are presenting and the way you are presenting it to be most positive and integrated. Yes. Okay. How do you tell us? Thank you. Give on. I had a very dear friend who missed in this bar that she has twinned. And I would like to ask you about twins, and that's sure specifically what to ask you, but she's very determined about it. They're older now. And they've been having some emotional problems often on. And you're never at the same time. So what's the difference? Could you tell me a little bit about twins? Well, first of all, are they identical or what you call fraternal? Do understand the following idea. You have the concept you call reincarnation, yes? Whereby you reincarnate from life to life in what seems to be a timeline fashion. This life next price, the next price. That is only one perspective, what is actually occurring. You can also incarnate backwards. And you can also have more than one life in the same time frame. This is called counterpart consciousness. When you are dealing with what you label identical twins, generally this is a manifestation of one soul choosing to lead two lives in the same time period, yet experience slightly different things, hence the two different bodies and different experience. Very often they will be very linked in that particular instance, but they will also have the ability to interpret and experience their reality separately as well. That is the main reason for the split soul to speak. Is there something specific that is of difficulty that you can describe? No, I think she was the reading she had done, she felt that so many of the problems that they were having were as a result of their being explained. Well, inherently we would in that sense disagree. That is simply one neutral set of props in the circumstance, and if they wish to assign the difficulty to that, then yes, that effect will seem to happen, but it is not the actual cause. The cause will again depend very specifically on the individuals, the specific emotional difficulties that you are talking about. In this particular instance, it would be a bit easier for us if we can communicate directly with the mother or the twins, unless there is a specific issue, in which case we can address that now. What is this? What is the difference? I can tell that my husband and my own soulmate. What is that? Well, literally any individual that you interact with in any given moment is your soul mate for that moment. Understand as you reincarnate, again colloquially speaking, reincarnate. So do all the other individuals round in the mountain. And in general, individuals that you have a high affinity for or are directly in relationship with have lived otherwise with you. And in a sense, you can say you are a soul family, but soul mate can again simply be any individual you are interacting with, because if you are sharing any given moment with any other consciousness, that is a co-creation, that is a sharing you are made in that moment, so to speak, for the experience that you are. And individuals will utilize the symbol of soul mate in a non-integrative way, which takes the form of I am incomplete. Only when this other individual comes along will I be complete. That is my soul mate. All right, that is one perspective, but there is a built-in limitation with that thinking. You will always only attract to yourself an individual a reality that you are already the vibration of. So if you do not have your primary relationship with yourself fulfilled and cling to another individual out of a sense of need, because you are not already complete, you can only attract another individual who will reflect back to you that sense of incompleteness. So therefore, if you wish to share most fully with any of your soul mate, your willingness to nurture your primary relationship within yourself feeling complete and allowing yourself to heal whatever aspect within you do not feel complete, and then attracting another individual, you will attract a reflection of that completeness, and that will be fulfilling. That in that sense will allow you to share 100%, 100%, rather than 50, 50, which takes away 50% of your power. Does that make sense? Is that all? No, I have one more question. I would tell, we talked about how these come back to experience limitation. What do the people on your planet choose to form that? To explore the unfoldment of our purpose, enjoy, to discover, to learn things as if a new. This is also one of the abilities upon your planet. You can say if you wish, you come back to keep exploring limitations, but you can also understand that you are, as a society, transforming to a less limited physicality. And more literally, one of the advantages to this style of reality is that follows. All that is, or your higher self in that sense, which is an extension of all that is, already knows it all. When you know it all, there is, shall we say, a particular style of experience, you cannot experience paradoxically. That is discovery, learning, surprise. If you already know it all, you cannot experience any of those things. So one of the functions of this style of reality is to impose a forgetfulness upon yourself of 99.99. And the figure goes on for sense of the totality of your knowledge, so that when you do experience something, you can experience it as if a new. This, who us is very excited. You too can begin to look at it that way and revel in the joys of your discovery, for that is one of the unique characteristics of physical reality and the separation of your consciousness down to a pinpoint focus. There will be time for but a few more sharing. I'm interested in what we come here sacred sites. We have the customers before. Yeah. One thing that I would like to do is to be able to tune into them more than I do now. And to, one of the purposes would be to say, recover some of the information that's there, which is now lost. Oh, not lost, or you would not be able to recover it. It is there for the taking. Waiting. Yeah. Yeah. Go there. When you find yourself particularly excited about a particular idea, have it be your clear intention that at the first opportunity where one of those choices is that chooses, but first put out the intention, the physical going to the site you are speaking of will open the door and you are seeking. It is no accident that it excites you to go to such a spot. It is no accident which spot attracts you. So begin now as we had spoken up with the other individual to trust your intuition and act upon it at first putting it out as a clear intention, acting on whatever given moment from your excitement, but you will then find if you do that, that one of the choices very soon will be to go to one of these places in a most coincidental manner than go. I spent many hours at these sites and I guess maybe you just answered that then. I guess when I go there, I would like to be able to tune in more than I do. So you're just saying just go there. Well, we are not and validate the tuning in you have done that has served you on many levels. Use all your creations even that. But again, if you will in that sense, use your imagination while you are there and trust what your imagination is telling you that is your intuition communicating through your imagination. So if you have the urge to dance on one foot in the middle of a particular spot, go right ahead. It is not ridiculous. It is what your imagination is telling you will allow you to access the energies that you think. Thank you. That's pretty nice. Oh, pretty nice. We'll get you there. I look forward to the next time I'm out. Can I have a question about the Mayas? Yes, you can ask. From your perspective, the Mayas, like one of the groups say that had extraterrestrial associations. Yeah, particularly early on. Yes. Would that be with the plating? To some degree. Are there others? Yes. Not that we will name at this point. Okay. We heard that. That's a good question. Really? Maybe. Okay. So, you know, The Mayas would apply to some degree. With the Maya? To some degree. Mm-hmm. Well, um, is there anything else that you'd like to mention about that at this moment? Hey, are you aware of the symbol that is called the Crystal Skull? Yes. If you wish to access some of the information that you are sharing, allow yourself to be attracted to one of the places that they are housed and stare into its eyes. Right. That crystal is a coded key. That crystal contains within it knowledge, perhaps, undreamed of. The way to connect with that knowledge is with your clear intention and no fear to stare directly into the eye of the skull. What occurs will be so obvious that you will tell us. I, my understanding is that the Crystal Skulls at this time are one of the elements or keys in this transformation taking place on our Earth at this time. Is that true? One tool. But again, it is in a sense, and ultimately speaking a cosmic recording device and the way to access the encoded information is to stare into the eye. Do you have any suggestions on how I might, um, go about connecting up with one of the Crystal Skulls? Well, again, they are available and simply check it out. Allow yourself to attract to yourself particular individuals, put out the message that you desire such an interaction, and if you are willing to again keep your eyes open, you will attract it very quickly. Thank you very much. Um, thank you for your advice and previous interactions. It's been a lot to me. Thank you for your willingness to apply the knowledge for that is what allows it to become real. That is what allows it to transform from philosophy to physics, for everything we are discussing is physics. The one law in creation is what you put out is what you get that, and it is flawless. Therefore, we thank you. Hey. Hello. Hello, yeah. A technical question that's channeling along the regarding the process, the reporting for these, have you done what has been discussed? I will take that as a note. We've discussed many things. You have the keys through your recent discussions with the channel, and our particular suggestions turn them, then we will discuss it. Again, we remind you channeling is simply anything that you do without any doubt, without any hesitation, you are channeling from your higher self, the personality that you are. When you do something you truly enjoy without any thought, you are channeling that. Simply take that same lack of hesitation and apply it to that form of channeling. Thank you. And perhaps one observation, although up until our, this is regarding healing, mental illness. Many of the subjects we talked about tonight, up into our current time, the official motor healing has been largely pharmaceutical and psychoanalytical. One of them. There has always been the natural alternatives. But do you proceed? Right. I think that we're moving very strongly now in the direction of the natural alternative. In September of this year, a book by the name of Breakthrough, published written by Joe Matthews Larson, a founder of a very successful chemical dependency rehabilitation center in Minneapolis, called Health Recovery Center. Her cure is around 80 percent alcoholic and people in chemical dependency problems and so forth. How is that? It is. I think that in the future that the biochemical restoration approach, particularly when combined with the recreational type of therapy that you've outlined to the degree will form. The recreational approach, as you have called it, will always then provide corresponding changes in biophysical medicine. Again, understand your body is the result of your consciousness. Individuals think it happens to your body first, then in a sense, your consciousness, and it is always the other way around. Even the physical manifestations are a result of the consciousness. So therefore, you can utilize both approaches but do understand the mechanical. Right. Some individuals believe the physical comes first and you can work with their beliefs utilizing what you are saying. Or I have one belief that issue here. It is strongly the issue for me. We come into the reality and I believe that we have a consensus as creators that bodies are such and such things and certain fuels are appropriate to bodies, certain substances are not. Well, yes, but that will be because of belief systems which are very strongly bought into. Not have a consensus belief system. Yes, and that is one of the reasons for choosing a particular reality to explore a particular consensus belief system, but you still always have the ability to decide to diverge from it. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, and everybody would be quite honest with what your beliefs are. Perhaps we have said you cannot change your belief by denying it. You must put it on the table so that you can then choose other beliefs on the same table. Yes. Yeah. I find myself in perhaps this is the issue. Not that willing or ready to take responsibility for changing a consensus belief. Well, how shall we say convenience? You never will anyway. Though your energy which adds to the consensus belief automatically does so in a sense anyway, but not by your intending on doing it just automatically. So the way that it has changed the basic seems to start thinking in terms of alternative left and momentum grow and so forth. The way to change everything is to change yourself. Right. With your willingness to change and affect change within yourself, all others will seem to change for you will be changing your perception and your relationship and your interaction to them and to your environment. That is why when you affect a change within yourself, others seem to change. They exist on many levels as well as you do and when you shift your level, you will then be interacting with that level of them and that seems from your perspective that they have changed. Roll a kick and thank you. At this time, it allow us to express to each and every one of you our unconditional love and appreciation for your willingness to begin to use all your creations. You created them, your mind as well. Therefore, have a good time with the things that we have discussed. Nothing that we share needs be taken with a heavy attitude. You can play, you can have a good time, you can use your imagination to allow yourself in the lightest possible way to begin to affect the changes in your life, but this does not mean you cannot have fun doing so. Therefore, we thank you and we did you in those fond and unconditionally loving is not known.
