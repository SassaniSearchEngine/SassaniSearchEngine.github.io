 All right, I'll say, how are you all this evening of your time as you create time to exist? How are you all? Are you all alive? Thank you very much, much better. We begin this interaction this evening of your time with the entitlement. Even that. How me or us to begin on the following note, we seek quite often to members of your society, not that this is just from us. It is coming up, shall we say, in the consciousness of your civilization, about the idea that you do create your own reality, has become quite the catchphrase in your new age, shall we say. The idea being from our perspective, this is true 100%. And this literally by extension means that you are all the entire universe, you all project your entire reality. And therefore the idea is that there is no outside. It is all you, all a reflection of your consciousness, paradoxically, individually for each and every one of you, this is simultaneously true. And the idea that it is possible for it to be true for each individual is an infinite idea, which you are exploring through finite senses. But the notion that there is no outside brings along with it the understanding that you cannot get rid of anything, for there is no outside, there is no where to get rid of it too. You are the entire universe, you project your entire universe. And therefore the furthest that you can quote unquote push something would still be within the parameters of your being or your consciousness. So therefore it is not shall we say a constructive idea to attempt to get rid of anything, for there is simply nowhere to put it. Or you can look at everything that is there, the things in your life, the events in your life, the relationships in your life, and understand that either consciously or unconsciously you have created them. Now you seem in that sense to have as you say no problem with the positive creations, therefore we will put them aside for the purposes of this introduction. However there is shall we say a certain amount percentage if you will of occurrences of relationships of events within your immediate reality that perhaps you do not prefer. Now these have also been created by you, but in general when a result is an unpreferred experience, it has been an unconscious creation, not a conscious one. We simply mean that we feel that in general you would not consciously on purpose create things which you do not prefer if you knew you had the choice and you do. Therefore many of your creations are generated from beliefs that you have and have held for various reasons as you are growing up bought into in this reality. And therefore because you are not necessarily conscious that it is your belief, you may say it is the product of an unconscious belief. Now the moment you think about it, obviously it is then conscious. But the idea is that you can only change them, you can only transform them, you cannot get rid of them, nowhere to get rid of them too. Therefore the question arises, how may I begin to bring to my conscious awareness these unconscious creations so that I may allow them to transform into great them. I know I cannot get rid of them, therefore I will allow them in that sense to transform. And the way to do this is to on some level understand that you have created it and look at it as a creator. A creator looks at things that they have created looking for the purpose for having created it. Now the idea of negative in general doesn't seem to your conscious awareness to be of service to you. So therefore even though an event may seem to have a most obvious negative overtone, that is not the reason you created it for you create symbols, you create ideas and events to be of service to you, to grow, to expand. Remember when you label something bad, you do not look at it as though you have created it and do not allow it in that way to serve you. You can begin to by simply realizing that you have created it all and when something that seems negative comes along rather than wallowing in it, you can ask yourself how does it serve me exactly as it is without changing a thing about it. And you will find that every idea is of service to you when you allow yourself to even assume that perspective unfailingly. Perhaps very often you will find that there are much more that actually serves you from what you have formally labeled negative than what actually seems negative about it. And this begins the process of taking your unconscious creations and making them conscious. You can only change a reality when you change the underlying belief and you can only change a belief once you own that you have that belief, the ones that would be considered unconscious in general are ones that you either do not realize you have bought into or deny that you have bought into. And owning it simply means saying, oh right, oh right, oh right, perhaps I wish I did not have this belief but I do have it. That is acknowledgement, admittance, owning the belief and this is always the first step to changing it. Everything serves you if you will allow yourself to look at why and how it is of service to you. Everything, no matter what, even the worst thing you can imagine, even that. So the idea is that you can now begin to use what you have considered to be a big, all right, drag in your life to allow you and afford yourself the greatest opportunity for growth and the greatest opportunity to transform the remnants of what you do not prefer in your life. Even that no matter what it is, you can say even that, perhaps at first you may say even that but the idea is yes, even that. Even now to look at as things occur, their relationship to you in service, perhaps the service will simply be allowing you to key in on what you must have believed to create it in the first place. Again, it is always an opportunity to look at any situation and say, what must I believe before I know my beliefs create my emotions create my thoughts create my actions, what must I believe in order to have created it? Let me look at this. That is using it all, all your creations. And this is what allows the ones you say you do not prefer to transform. Usually by the way, quite immediately and you all seem to be in a rush to expand your consciousness. So you can use any given moment. Understand briefly, all situations, all events, all relationships, all ideas, everything is a fundamentally neutral set of props blank as you say, zip. You ascribe what you feel the meaning is to you and the meaning you ascribe and assign it literally is the effect you get back. It is very easy to prove that to yourself. Therefore, everything can be of service. It can be why is this happening to poor little old me or it can be how is this serving me exactly as it is. One of the things that keeps away from your conscious awareness, the ideas that you wish to transform is the idea of judgment itself. As a momentary digression, we will define judgment in the following way. Observation or discernment is looking at a particular set of parameters or a particular event and seeing how it relates to you. I prefer it, I don't prefer it, period, that is observation, that is discernment. And you can always stop all processes or analyses at that point if you will allow yourself. Judgment is saying, I prefer this, I do not prefer that and therefore that stinks. What that does is assigns it a weight or a meaning that is less than the rest of creation, which by the way, paradoxically gives it more, not less weight. So the idea is that judgment in and of itself closes the door to your ability to transform an idea for you cannot own something by invalidating it. You cannot integrate it by judging it as being less than all the rest of creation. So therefore you can also along these lines begin to hone in on where you are most willing to judge either yourself, situations or others. Judgment again is an invalidation of the thing you do not prefer and you can simply establish what you prefer, what you do not prefer and stop at that set. Oh, how interesting this information is. But you need not invalidate the other thing that you do not prefer. We have shared many times that the ultimate truth is composed of all truths by definition. Therefore all truths are true to those who buy into them and who create them into their reality and you cannot in that sense, and I am sure you are aware of this experientially talk them out of their beliefs, you can express your beliefs, share your alternative choices, but their reality will seem just as real to them and therefore it is just as real. Therefore when you invalidate another truth that being a lie, you are simply not recognizing that it is simply as valid a truth that you are not choosing to prefer and your willingness to equalize all ideas and here's the key gives you equal access to them, equal access to choose the thing you prefer. When again you do not prefer something and judge and invalidate it, you do not give it less weight, you give it more weight, you hold it in check and therefore do not have equal access to choose the thing that you do prefer from the thing that you don't. When you simply notate to yourself what you prefer, what you do not prefer, except what you do not prefer as just as valid, even that is just as valid, then you give yourself absolute equality to choose either including the thing you prefer. So begin to use all your creations in this way, bleeding how they are of positive service to you, begin to understand if you wish, that judgment is the invalidational assignment of meaning that does not allow you to use your creation. Or even as you change and expand into higher consciousness and perhaps like yourself better by invalidating who it is you used to be and putting yourself where you are up on a pedestal that you are now so much better, you are invalidating the very stepping stones that allow you to be the way you say you prefer. So understand though you may not have preferred the way you quote unquote use to be, you can simply acknowledge it and not invalidate it, understand that it had its place and in fact was essential to allow you to be the you you feel you now prefer. And you can do this across the board, anytime you find yourself judging, anytime you find yourself feeling overwhelmed by some particular aspect of your reality you simply are not looking at how it serves you because of your upbringing and the quote unquote engrainment of certain beliefs. You may feel that you automatically will assign particular negative meanings to particular circumstances every time they come around with no thought. And even these ideas you can do this with perhaps you will have your initial re-action but then you can take a conscious action afterwards, alright, alright, alright you may say. I understand what is negative about this everybody knows, what is negative about this. Now I will be a bit more crafty. Now I will acknowledge my creatorhood and ask myself how it serves me. You will be amazed at how many ideas will immediately come up. Some may play out over time but there will always be something, something that you can believe about why not only did it serve you but it was absolutely essential that that happened. Now here's the good news. When you begin to allow your unconscious creations to become conscious you begin to then only continue to generate realities believed consciously. In a sense you weed out the unconscious ones and then proceed in action only making conscious decisions. What happens in your physical life at that point is a reflection of the conscious decisions. So what again we are saying is as you begin to create consciously the things which you would have formally tended to label negative will begin to transform out so to speak of your reality. Begin to integrate and perhaps be a notion but not an experience. So you will not need go around labeling things which you feel on some level as negative the rest of your life and feel that you are playing some mental game now. At first this is how to grab the bull by the horns in that you create it to be a bull sometimes. But the idea is that it is that simple and you can begin any time you wish right now. So next time you feel something to be particularly negative perhaps you can allow your consciousness to wander to the idea of even that. Even that serves me. Even that. How amazing. Would never have looked at it that way in the past. Now I am allowing myself the opportunity to use even that to grow. To use even that to transform all my creations to occur according to prep and do understand. It is simply a belief that you must experience 50% positive and balance it out with 50% negative. If you have that belief I need not tell you that you can experience that reality. But if you look at the belief that you can be aware of perhaps 50% positive 50% negative but only need personally experienced 100% positive that is also a belief that is available. It is also that simple. Everything we are sharing is quite simple. So therefore if you have a belief that you must have a complicated process and you wish to experience it as being that simple look at that belief that you have that belief that limiting belief that you have to have a complicated process. We are not saying that reality creation existence is not complex rich in diversity but the mechanisms for creating are quite effortless and in fact you do it without in a sense thinking. Therefore you can begin to hear it toward the positive manifestation. And you can use again what you formally labeled negative if you will but even give yourself the opportunity to do it even once. You will see that to the degree that you are willing to assign it a positive meaning you will get a positive proportional reflection from it. When you allow yourself to do this over a period of time you in a sense counter act the momentum quote unquote momentum that you seem to have created with the unconscious creation and replace them. You don't get rid of them. You transform them and in a sense replace them with new preferred beliefs. So even that. And in fact you can go a step further. You can actually thank yourself, thank all that is when something quite negative comes along you can say even that and then go to the next step. Thank you, thank you for the opportunity to see a limiting belief that when I transform we'll no longer consistently seem to be a repetitive issue. And you can simply rejoice in this mechanism for you already create this way only again partially unconsciously and what we are speaking of now is conscious creation. Before we begin the interaction allow us to also share that when we say you create your own reality we do so to allow you to take back the responsibility to do it consciously not to judge and blame yourself for the creations in your life that you do not prefer. That type of judgment is one of the ideas that we have just shared. When you find yourself judging yourself for it look at it and see how even that serves you and what you must believe about yourself to be judging yourself. So you can use even that the judgment itself to allow you to transform your beliefs. That this timing allow us to thank you and express our unconditional love and appreciation for your willingness to unfold according to perfect timing. You live within a physical reality and one of the properties of that reality that by the way you also create is time and therefore one of the shall we say results of time is timing, unfoldment is the idea of revealing portions of yourself that perhaps you have talked away to your conscious self according to a particular timing and you can begin to look at that timing and revel or marvel or appreciate or be in awe of that very timing. You can say how fascinating for it is all quite fascinating if you are willing to perceive it in that way. You are perfect creators and you can create perfect fascination or from time to time perfect misery. It is up to you and it always has been. For your willingness in this way to begin to consciously view your unfoldment again we thank you and ask you now how may we be of service to you. I am still here. What this individual is referring to is that my particular scout craft is in your solo system at this time. Well I wonder if you could use that in common relationship with the crew members that are present. Oh right we will unfold but the idea is that I am aboard my craft with two other shall we say members of my society. One is a male and has been participating in these interactions though we call ourselves our myself bashard is actually shall we say a blending of me this other male individual from our planet but there is also upon my craft that this time another female entity who will also from time to time be communicating through this channel for specific reasons at various timing to allow other nuances of our society in that we also at this point for just a little while longer choose to embody ourselves there are particular advantages to communications from a female stream of energy per se as well as the male so therefore you will find those two individuals to be counterparts if you will of each other and correspond very strongly to the channel before you. So did she have any communications tonight. It says you can say she is and has been for the last two or three interactions part of the blending there is a specific reason for the shall we say a quantization of the channel in this way we will explain that in a further interaction. Is that. How are we friends. Shelly. As you knew. Is there a particular reason why you are. Yes as we have just recently shared we are in that way observing particular historical happenings on your planet that is one nuance of what we are doing and the other nuance of what we are doing has to do with the attunement of the physical child before you for the purposes of the ongoing interactions in which I best are in this may get a bit confusing received entirely and the other entity. Will in that sense take over so to speak but again realize that other entity has been part of the blending in that way so therefore it may not seem too different those shifts there will be. I was looking to the set where a woman was explaining a brain she had to you and you were telling her that all the characters in the dream were aspects of herself. Is that possible or is that just a security that. Well there is the idea that other consciousness can interact with you in your dream state but technically speaking you are creating your version of them so quite literally it is a reflection of yourself though there may be shall we say a co creation involved. But if you will begin to look at aspect of your and we are speaking now of your nighttime sleeping dream for to us this is a dream also you are dreaming right now. But the idea is from the perspective that all the characters are you you will begin to realize that some of the things that you have been interpreting in that way will take on new meanings and allow you to do a lot of self discovering from those shall we say in position. So very similar to the waiting thing that everyone will interact with you sort of an example and you say that you come to us from the future however you are in our solar system now well the idea is again once you have learned that space and time or a property of the object itself and that you do not exist within space and time and also recognize that space and time are actually space time one thing then in a sense when you can learn to transcend one the other is automatically transcended with the mode of travel that we use. So therefore there are shifts shall we say in our dimensional frequency to allow us to manifest in your dimension of existence but we are able to do so is there more of a specific question that you have how long did it take you to get from a society to hear it was shall we say instantaneous though there is what you might say an acclimation period of approximately ten minutes prior and after what you might label the jump. Okay you do not know satisfied please keep asking if you wish. In our solar system can you identify about where you are now at this particular time we are what you would label approximately one moment allow us to scan. Approximately five thousand miles from your planet that is the closest approximation with shall we say the difficulty in translation that we have. There is more to this question. I was reading in the book about I guess some of your channeling with Darryl Anka and you mentioned something about coming there will be extraterrestrial manifestations in our time there already are in the odd years 1991 93 95 and is this part is this the reason why you might be here now. Perhaps it is coincidental with that idea but not the reason in another sense and it is unlikely that your civilization in that sense will interact with us directly for quite a few years though it is one option but the idea of the 1993 95 97 99 was simply an indication of the momentum of energy not a prediction of the future at which it seems most likely that your government who already knows on some level not all of them across the board that the of the existence of particular extraterrestrial societies will begin to leak out into your public awareness. I'm looking forward to meeting you all right as long as you keep looking forward you will keep pushing it into the future but we understand. Is that all? We're going to have to thank you. All right. Shannon. You're sure? No. And do you? Greetings. I've just recently become in touch with the aspects of myself that I've been in the process before. Oh how excited? Yes. Opening the doors. Yes. And I'd like to know if you could give me some information on how to come more from my heart to be more compassionate, to be more patient. It is quite simple. In a sense you just do it but also when you find yourself leaning in another direction or having another tendency to not do it, look at it. Even that will serve you. Even that will allow you to see okay I wish to be compassionate, I wish to be loving. In this moment I do not feel either toward for instance this individual. Therefore what must I believe to be feeling this way? For emotions are always a result of a belief. So you can always use your emotions rather than settling for well I just feel that way. You can always use your emotions to key you in to particular beliefs. Does that make sense? Yes. In terms of your opening up other aspects of yourself and perhaps communicating bridging gaps in that sense, very simply our suggestion would be to become quite clear in what it is you wish to explore. Prepointedly compile if you wish questions or statements of interactions. They do not have to be questioned simply dialogue and begin to ask them of these other portions but also leave yourself some space to physically listen for the answers. And this is what will set up an energy flow, a dialogue. In that sense I will simply remind you that you cannot listen while you are speaking. So if you will ask the question, listen for the answer. Sometimes I don't listen. Or the other idea is you do listen you do get the answer and simply invalidate it. So begin to place validity in the answers as being the answers that you need at that time and by validating them you open up the invitation to receive more communication. By saying that is nonsense I just made it up you shut the door. One other question. I was feeling, part of me was feeling that it was not safe to be in your presence. Oh my. Actually it was you. And I wanted to know if you could validate for me that yes it is safe to be here with your energies and the other entities that are here with you and how safe is this. I don't know where this feeling is coming from other than someone has mentioned to me to surround yourself with wide lines. Is that the idea? Something similar to that. The idea is simply this. There is no out. It is all a reflection of you. If you set up the protection you set up the attack. If you have a fear that something can get you what you are really saying and what that aspect of fear is is that something that you do not prefer is most likely which is the same as saying that you believe it. So this gives you an opportunity to establish within yourself exactly how much you believe you create your own reality. And again when you do not believe you created 100% which is literally true then the notion arises that something can slip in there and get you. But the idea is I will leave it to your sense of discernment in interacting with our energy as to whether our energy in any way shape or form would be positive or negative. The idea is that our perspective is such that we never say this is the way it is. We never say our way is the only way. We never say that what we are saying is better than what you are doing. We simply share with you our perspective. We share with you our unconditional love and allow you to choose within your reality what will work for you and respect any decision you make even if it is to take off and never come back again. For you will get what you need from this interaction and if the style of interaction does not consciously seem to serve you you will get what you need somewhere else. But the easiest answer to your question would simply be to listen to your own heart and allow yourself to discern from what is before you not from what anybody else has said what you truly feel from our energy. I feel that I am safe with all it is and with you. I had allowed myself to go away from what I believed and what I felt because of what this person meant to me and what they said. But you have learned from it and that even that has served you. Understand another perspective that we have is we are not intrusive. We are not obtrusive and certainly not invading one of the reasons that we are interacting with your society in this somewhat unconventional way at this timing is because we will only come face to face so to speak when we are invited and in that sense all of the extraterrestrial civilizations that are in contact with your planet in that sense will only come on mass when invited. There is what you might loosely label from your science fiction literature a non interference directive in full force. But the idea that we would choose in that sense to hone you in on is the idea of the need for protection for that in and of itself sets up the very attack. Remember it is all. Now this does not mean that if you do not prefer or your discernment allows you to observe that you do not prefer something that you need condone it or participate in it. But you need not invalidate what you do not. Hi. And just a statement. The other night I had in my dream your name was in my one of my dreams and then the very next day. I wish I had said you were going to be here tonight which we weren't aware of and I just felt that that was also a reason for me to be here tonight and to ask you these questions. Oh what? Yes. Oh stand by the way. Synchronicity is the idea that all aspects of reality are aspects of one reality. Everything is all one thing all interwoven nothing is extraneous or pointless. Therefore co incidents need not mean by accident though sometimes it is used in that way in your language. It can simply mean co incidences, incidences occurring at the same time in perfect timing. So therefore what you in that sense are participating in is synchronicity. However we have had shall we say a bit more direct contact with you in that dream reality and therefore you have to pick up on that. Thank you. What is that threatening? No. All right. Thank you very much for the unwillingness to share these questions. Thank you. Shit. Hi Shara. Hey. The question is probably a little more different than you usually are. All right. Always willing and able. Regarding the Holy Grail, the sorry Holy Grail. Are you people familiar with it? We understand the idea. Good. I mean regarding the blending of the white light on dark side of the individual or the female and the male part for the positive and negative in that blending. Is there any suggestions to look into it from your point of view or any help that can be shared at this time? Well the idea is again it is all you all within you. As you expand your consciousness you become more aware. In this particular reality that demonstrates and expresses polarity, positive and negative you will become more aware of the positive but more aware of the negative as well. The idea is you need not experience the negative. Simply you may be at first more aware of it and that is part of the expansion. The idea of our perspective of negative are ideas which are separated which are not recognizing that you are all one thing. Judgment is shall we say one of the tools that enables you to maintain separation. Positively or positive from our perspective is the idea of integrating. Understanding everything is a part of you and beginning to act. That is the key. That way. It begins to integrate the positive and the negative so again you may be more aware of both but only need experience and put out the positive in that way. The male and female energy need not be equated to positive or negative for neither is negative or positive with the definitions that we have just rendered but the idea is they are indicative of energies which are existent in everybody. Though you have a male body you contain the idea of female energy and male energy both. Your soul in that sense is well shall we say both and neither at the same time but when you embody yourself in a physical reality some of them in that sense you can physically become more of one but you do not contain any less of the energy of the other. Very often in your society individuals will rigidly buy into that they can only act in one particular way and negate and perhaps not utilize the other energy but very simply rendered female energy is simply the idea of receptivity. Openness in tuition looking inward and male energy is simply outflow action at the activity not in an obnoxious way and that combination makes up a whole being. Is this addressing the question? Yes. Regarding God and our view on her of the superior being source of maker. By the way from our perspective the word superior in that sense if you are regarding to ability perhaps would be in that way appropriate but in terms of quality all that is which is our slightly more descriptive label for God is not superior to you for you are an expression of all that is itself therefore you are made of equal stuff do go on. People have the same thing for a similar thing. The idea is the reason we call it all that is because by convention that presupposes that everything exists within it. Now I do not mean it in that sense to impersonalize it for it is at the same time everything at the same time simultaneously but at the also same time has its own conscious awareness any aspect or version of any particular culture or society's God in that sense to us is all the one all that is and within the one all that is since it is all that is there is nothing that is not. So you regard the mind that is saying God? Yes though we may have different ideas of the attributes of it. Our understanding is by convention since we are all expressions extensions of all that is itself that all that is is unconditionally loving would not in that sense chop off portions of itself and understands everything as a portion of itself and unconditionally unconditionally loves itself therefore everything in creation. There is a societal notion within your planet of the idea of certain attributes that you are ascribing to all that is that from our perspective our human attributes, judgments, vengeance but to our way of thinking that does not make sense even your own literature says you are made in the image and likeness of God not that God is made in the image and likeness of man and woman. So therefore our view of God is unconditionally loving and again we have used in your vernacular the analogy that therefore you can't screw up. You will always be loved by all that is. Now how you feel about yourself and how you judge yourself according to your own notions of integrity is a different story but judge not let you be judged as a reflection of the idea that if you judge you become the reflection of judgment the expression of judgment and therefore can only attract opportunities to judge and opportunities to be judged but not by all that is by you and the reflection of you. All that is loves you no matter what. I do you as well for the beautiful question is that all? My mind why we're talking when is so that after an entire time and I was wondering if was anything you could share this time with us and what really happened at that time with the turning around in the morning. At this time for the purposes of this interaction with these particular participants we will be very non specific and get into more of the idea of the overall exploration rather than the specific physical occurrences. But the idea is that there was quote unquote was a society upon your planet that you would consider to be as advanced or perhaps in some aspects a bit more advanced than your society is right now. At the point of their inception they in that sense had a very strong understanding of their connectedness to all that is. As in that sense the emphasis became and was rendered to the externalized tools and the externalized world more of the idea of that direct connection in that sense was literally forgotten. As this happened and the connection itself seemed severed which by the way it was not simply individuals shows to create the idea that it could be which it can't. What then begins to happen is when individuals do not feel directly connected to all that is there is a sense of what we label perceived helplessness and when individuals do not realize that they flow their reality from them and therefore can allow things to be as they prefer they then come upon the notion of needing to dominate and control and make things conform to particular ideas because in effect they feel so helpless that that is the only way they can kick and scream to in a sense seem to force things to happen. This overall idea of breakdown resulted in what you would label internal conflict struggle for if you will and this is what resulted ultimately in what you would label the full quote unquote full of Atlantis. More however we would like to draw your attention to the idea that your current civilization right now from our perspective is a recapitulation of the Atlantean idea with different nuances, different explorations but our strongest sensing is though you are at a similar junction where you could have chosen in that sense to blown yourself up you will choose not to. So therefore it has been used in that sense as a lesson and in a sense began a cycle upon your planet of approximately 25,000 years of forgetfulness self-imposed limitation which you are now beginning to rub your eyes, awaken from and you are now in a sense in the reciprocal arrangement of that Atlantean scenario. Therefore you are within full swing of your transformation from what you sometimes call old to new age but in a sense from self-imposed limitation to becoming more aware of your limit lessness. Does that help? Thank you very much. Asking you as well. I have to explore my actions five or six years ago past associates to complicate the situation so that listening to you now I realize of course that I created all of that to discover something. All of that it goes. Forgetting that I created the reality and that blaming the other individual. Which does not then give you the opportunity to do much about it and they are unlikely to change. We are even blaming myself for having created it to the degree that I am responsible for. What will that do for you and what will that allow you to change the blame in another self? I am looking for the belief. I have the perspective that I have created and I do learn a great deal about myself and how I have changed and how I have grown and what more I can be believing now. Yet when I flip to the other perspective I wonder what it is that I believe that I need to be attacked, persecuted, punished, suspicious. Can you help me find that? The idea is when we had shared with you that all that is loves you unconditionally that you begin to look toward the notion of treating yourself with that same respect. When you find yourself expressing guilt, remorse and judgment upon yourself, understand these are not expressions of self love. So you can use even that. I see that. The idea also is you never truly become when you as you say flip like a pancake. The idea is you never actually truly become the quote unquote old you. You simply assume the position of the old you but you now have more information. So therefore in a sense you are the new you looking through the eyes of the old you but since the new you is also there the new you can see and green how it serves you. Do you understand? Yes. Is there something more specific we can address? I could have it. It's flipping. All I put understand a habit is something that you do that you are not aware that you are doing. Therefore once you become aware of it you don't have a habit and what you can now understand is that and I understand at first this may seem a bit strange but it is no longer a habit. It is a choice. Now the idea is this once you even acknowledge that it even might be a choice the opportunity that that brings is for you to sensing yourself to the idea that if it is a choice there are other choices and then you give yourself the opportunity to begin to seek what those other choices are and if you will work when one of the choices is to go into self judgment at what some of the other choices might be and decide which choice truly excites you the most it will most likely not be the judgment but again the judgment in and of itself is an opportunity to begin to look at treating yourself with unconditional love for you can only in that sense reflect to others an expression of how you truly treat and feel about yourself. So that by choosing love when I produce that observer by choosing love in that moment I can prefer my way out of this. Well in the case you can transform or choose something else. Again when you look at it as a choice rather than a habit. All right I've flipped so to speak now that I have flipped I know this is a choice not a very good choice well let me look around what else is here right here right now here are some other choices I can take a walk I can go watch television I can sit here and self judgment well which one of these choices seems most attractive to me well I think any of them except the judgment I think I'll go take a walk watch television and have a drink or whatever. Do you understand? You ground yourself into the moment that you are in for each and every moment in your reality has within it a particular advantage if you are honed in and fixated and obsessed in that moment on a particular quote unquote negative interpretation because as we have said everything is neutral it is an interpretation you can begin to realize that perhaps that particular moment has other things within it and look around so the technique will vary for a moment to moment for there will be different things available in each moment. Yes thank you and we thank you as well is that all? Yes. Sure. I love everything you're saying here I have a lot of time. The reason you love it is because you contain it so pat yourself on the back anything that you understand and revel in that we share you would not hear unless you contained it to begin with so I thank you. Well now I have been from what I'm understanding do I understand that there is no beginning in the end? In the old sense no because you are all as you are a reflection of what you label God multi-dimensional infinite and eternal now within the physical parameters of your quote unquote physical life there would seem to be a beginning middle and an ending but in the overall perspective of your totality shall we say your soul's perspective no you are eternal. And we just are. Yes you are. Okay thank you. Can I ask a few more? Go right ahead. How old is your entire society tell a topic or have you just evolved? Our entire society upon our planet is tell by the way tell empathic that is much more descriptive of the mechanism empathy identification with creating the same thoughts at the same time more than the idea of reading someone's mind. And how can you put the age of your planet in terms that we would understand what you might say for a particular frame of reference is that our civilization upon our planet has existed and we are now translating this into your idea of years for our perception of time varying slightly from yours would be approximately from nine to twelve thousand years. Okay do you see you are the success you believe we're taking a different approach than at last. This is one of the reasons we are observing and co creating these interactions upon your planet for we are shall we say interested in transitional period in the histories of civilization. So that's very positive I need to hear something positive about our future. Oh look around you you are beginning to see things that you never imagined would happen in your life. Formally you had mostly bad news on TV you are beginning to see other ideas which can now validate externally the new positive reflection which again is only a reflection of your internal beingness and as you begin to transform yourself the world around you will change for it is always a reflection of your inner self. And yet it seems like that there seems to be more violence and more anger. Well if you want to look at it technically not more just about the same amount perhaps in some instances actually less. Well the idea is what are you using as evidence are you using the individuals which aid in this other individuals or are you using the violence as the evidence for what you believe and you can use the idea is when you begin to act in positivity not just have it as a notion your immediate atmosphere your immediate surrounding environment will seem to change the people that you interact with as you begin to be more loving will seem to be more loving it will seem like an amazing occurrence but what will happen is eventually like a stone drop into the middle of a pond this will ripple out further and further to it literally literally begins to be on your six o'clock news but it begins from you. Can I ask one more question? You can ask. What kind of an invitation would extraterrestrials need to come to our planet and so that we all can perceive them what form of invitation. Well we are speaking of with what we have mentioned this evening would be a consensus invitation a consensual reality invitation where individuals are a prize of our existence which is only now beginning to occur and once they are a prize if there is enough of the momentum behind the desire to interact not because we're going to save you you are not drowning but because we will interact as equals that is what we speak of and that is when you will find that there is an association of many civilizations and planets to which you in a sense can join. Thank you. Andrew you were so. Do you have any suggestions on how to I don't want to use the work get rid of because you said you can't get rid of anything but to like as is a flat and reactivity. Well the idea is exactly that when you pre act you are not acting so the first idea the first notion is to hone in as to when you do it watch yourself do it become more of a participant in the process as you are watching yourself do it ask yourself is this what I prefer is this the person I prefer to be perhaps when the interaction itself is over sit down and reflect use your imagination your imagination by the way is also a tool which enables you to create any reality you wish in the following way what you do is reconstruct what had just happened look at what you did how you felt how you reacted then conjure up in your imagination an image of the preferred you the you you say you wish you are which you are anyway the idea is plug that situation into that image handed over to the preferred imaginary you allow that imaginary you to handle it watch how they handle it and next time you that you will first of all love what you see that is the preferred you and when you see the alternative way that you quote unquote could have handled it will be quite simple next time to do that thing but what we'll see most amazing is when you do mimic the preferred you in your imagination in that moment you are the preferred you and therefore you will get the effect that the preferred you will get and not the effect that you say you wish you never got to begin with so the idea is that the first time that you in a sense institute this idea the situation that you were in that perhaps had somewhat of a predictable outcome will immediately have a different outcome for the interaction itself hinges on your participation as a reactor when you do not react it cuts off the process and the interaction changes does that make sense all right where you do it thank you will you do it how was it time and recognize what we have shared about the imaginary you is available to each and every one of you can create a referential preferential you in your imagination if you will begin to rather than react take a few breaths that is a mechanism for centering yourself conjure up the preferred you hand the situation over before you react you can head it off right then and then and you will always love if you give yourself the opportunity to view what the preferred you would do you will always love what it does so it will not be any big effort to do that and in fact you will look forward to doing it and you will get the effect of it at first you may do a lot of handing over to the imaginary you but as you begin to mimic and copy the actions of the imaginary you they will become as automatic as your reactions were and therefore you will then eventually simply get that sample together and be that preferred you check. So you have currencies or money or exchange? Yes. All services in that sense are considered of equal value and the exchange is a pure and even equal exchange we have no monetary symbol that we ascribe a particular intermediate or conduit value to. In a sense your society will move toward this idea from our perspective but it will first take the idea of a unitization of the planet for one of the impediments to such an exchange factor direct exchange is borders so therefore as they dissolve and integrate you will find the entire distribution of wealth on your planet will change. So how thinks that is less a I want to use the word communist because it's a wrong connotation in this country but that's a socialistic or a communal living. In a sense but not really for there is no structure there is no hierarchy there is no need to be governed for we all govern ourselves but if you were to perhaps make an analogy and this will not be that direct for you have so many connotations upon the value of one service versus another on your planet but the idea is it would be closest to what you label bartering. So there is a form of bartering? Yes. Again there are connotations to your bartering and the uneven weight assigned to particular services which are simply not a part of our equation. Do you have distinguishing different jobs people do or what kind of their life does be? The idea is it is quite spontaneous so jobs in a sense may get done but we have no professions we do not define ourselves by the things that we do we do not derive our self worth from doing one particular thing and therefore you can say we are a master of all trades in a sense. The idea more directly is we always have what we need to have when we need to have it we always know what we need to know when we need to know it and we always have around us exactly who what and where we need to do what it is we wish to do in any given moment and surprisingly enough so do you we are simply conscious of it and look for it and it has become quite automatic that we see nothing else. Do in a sense have denied some of this and at first need to look for it but it also again becomes automatic after a while. Do you people eat food like we do? Less and less as you are transforming from limited physicality what we label third density to limit less physicality or less limited physicality fourth density we are transforming from fourth to fifth density fifth density is non physical. Have we get closer to that juncture of becoming completely non physical bit by bit we lose or shall we say no longer choose to utilize external tools. So therefore though we in a sense could eat if we wish to and did by the way in our past right now we are more at the point where there is a direct energy exchange with our very environment. We also find your scenario quite fascinating and do not judge it as being less than anything upon our planet simply another fascinating valid experiment and we thank you for your willingness to share it with us. Thank you for sharing your view and us. At this time we will pause for a short break and resume contact in this session in 10 to 15 of your minutes.
