 All right, I'll say, continue shift. The Shar? Yes. Greetings to you. I do this evening. Perfect. As our old human body. You have indicated to us, the Shar, that in the transformation from third density to fourth density, we might experience some physiological changes. And over the last two, three, four months, I've noticed something and I wanted to bring it up and see if you had any comments. What I've been experiencing is maybe yawning, maybe feeling drowsy, maybe feeling sleepy in the morning, maybe even in the afternoon, maybe even in the evening. And I don't believe that it's because I'm bored or anything like that or that I haven't maybe had enough rent or something. I prefer to believe that maybe that's just part of my transformation. Any comments from you would be most helpful. All right, and thank you in that sense for the opportunity. Do recognize that sometimes we ascribe some particular aspects that you may label symptoms to the idea of the transformation itself and in general, though this need not occur and we are not suggesting you need feel this, by the way, in order to transform. But in general, from time to time when individuals resist or judge aspects of their transformation, they produce a style of friction within them that may in that sense mimic what you label, fever. The idea is also from time to time again with a little bit of judgment on it for all pain is resistance, resistance to your natural flow, resistance to your natural ecstasy. But the idea is that from time to time, individuals will feel certain sensations in the head, sensations in the sinus cavity, sensations in the heart chakra area. For these areas are particularly sensitive to changes in the electromagnetic field upon your planet. And as in that sense you integrate, you will notice realizing again everything is simply an externalized reflection of you that you will have more of an empathic relationship with other individuals as well as the society as well as the very planet itself. However, what you are speaking of in a sense is what we sometimes label an aspect of what certain individuals choose to create when they are unlocking from an old reality and re-establishing in that sense a new preferred reality. And this is loosely sometimes turned by us to be the limbo state. What this state in that sense sometimes has the appearance of perception is that nothing is moving, nothing is happening, things are somewhat slow. But in a sense our explanation of what is happening is that in a sense you are now moving at infinite speeds and have caught up in that sense with the motion and flow of your reality. So relatively speaking it seems not to be moving simply because you have caught up. Again though, that place is perfect center where there is no more momentum behind one idea than another because again you are matching the speed and flow of your reality and the simple way to in that sense transform that idea in a positive way is simply to begin to and this may sound familiar. Establish within the choices that are available to you the ones with integrity that truly excite you. For your excitement is your indication of your moment to moment and overall purpose in life. It is the literal translation of that energy is the literal indication or barometer or compass of your purpose. So what I am getting at is begin to establish what excites you but don't stop at that step. Begin to then move in any way, shape or form that you can according and toward that which excites you will find the idea of shall we say limbo or saying still will then seem to result. In other words get going. I do believe I made quite a bit of progress in living the philosophy we talk about. And you have but this is simply an indication that you are now ready to take the next step. And you are literally within the parameters of even your physical existence within your life at this time in limbo. Even sociologically speaking. So therefore you can look at this as being stuck standing still or you can understand that you now have equal equal access and potentiality to manifest anything that which you do not prefer or that which you do. So begin to define that what you do so you have something in that sense to aim your sights upon in a sense. I do feel as though I am in a sense a starting line situation anxious to get started and as you suspect no I am very anxious to pursue the exciting water fuel cell activity. Oh I think you need not pursue it and you are very wording of it as pursue. In that sense denotes that you may never quite catch it. And your attitude I understand it seems that you have physically nothing to do with it but your attitude of pursuit and looking forward to does keep it in your experiential reality in the future. The idea is that if you simply concentrate on what you can do you will find that to resolve itself most quickly. But when we talk about doing what excites you from what's available right now we do not mean from what is not available right now. So therefore though that is an intention a clear intention a clear definition if you will. If there is nothing you can immediately do right now look at what you can do right now. And picking from those choices the one that excites you the most with integrity is actually the very concept the very notion the very event the very action that will get you to the most exciting thing most quickly. Though in that moment it seems entirely unrelated and again it is because everything is all one thing synchronicity and though it seems to have nothing to do with the quote unquote end result it does most directly through coincidences again stepping stones you cannot necessarily see that this stone leads to the one at the end of the pond but you cannot get there before you step on this one. Okay but I assume what you're saying does not eliminate my I'm in the process of some creative action to my preference and so we'll see where that leads me. I'm not only allowing but I'm also doing some creative effort. What are your options and if you will continue to stay in the moment you will find there are moments that you can act upon it but the moments that you cannot act upon that thing if you sit and seek your consciousness in that very thing that there is nothing you can do about right now you don't give yourself the opportunity to see what's right in front of you. So begin to look around and being in that state of limbo means you have just as much of the opportunity to choose something to do from this point forward that you prefer as then something that you don't. You talk about could manifest itself in maybe my too much surprise sometimes feeling sort of reality or sleepy in a sense. When you in that sense judge that you are standing still very often that is one of the physiological results of that notion but you are not you are moving at infinite speeds and it takes very little effort in any direction when you are moving that fast to divert your course to exactly where do you wish to be. So you can look at it again as a slump or you can look at it as the opportunity to do anything you want. Very good I appreciate the input thank you. As you as well. Sure. I have an interesting thought here about why you might be here. All right there is more than one reason but to go on. In this area the channel and a group of us are anticipating doing some out of body experiences and we're interested in visiting with you. In this area we can inform necessitate my shall we say proximity to you physically for the idea is the state you label astral which incidentally is simply opening up an eye in a different portion of your own consciousness does not in that way have the boundaries of space and time. And you can travel much in the linear way walking from point a to b but you can simply think of point b and immediately take up residence there. Therefore there is no consideration of proximity in this type of interaction again also allow me to expand upon the point. What you label astral travel seems to be the idea of your soul leaving your body but again from our perspective your soul is not within your body. So from the perspective of your soul being within your body yet you seem to leave but from the understanding that your body is in the center of your very soul really all you really do is close the eyes at that one point and open them somewhere else in the bubble if you will of your totality. So you truly travel nowhere in a sense you might say space moves around you. Very interesting. So it won't be long we'll be there visiting with you. It is up to you the invitation is always extended and as we have shared at least at this particular point in timing the only way that you can visit our planet would be in the astral state and by simply maintaining shall we say your conscious viewpoint in the astral state all you need to if you wish in that sense to visit us is use the activating mechanism for what allows you to travel in that state and that is your emotions your energy motion again conjure up how interacting with us allows you to feel and that feeling will key you into our vibration and immediately allow you in that sense to visit. Thank you and to you. I have two questions. You're picking up our thoughts. Do you sense our aura do you see do you get a message beyond the word in a sense yes I do not see you I as you have somewhat said sense you though I sense you as a relationship a relationship to the whole mass consciousness upon your planet and a relationship to the other individual present in a sense as an analogy you may say we view your entire civilization as one large crystal and each of you a facet occupying a certain space with a certain relationship to all other and we communicate with levels to you beyond what you are physically perceived so your physical perception allows you to sense in that way that we are speaking to you and you are able to see the particular nuance of our energy that is translated into the motion of the hand but there is also the idea of our conscious awareness of our higher self communicating with your higher self our orick field if you will exchanging with your orick field in general because of the way you create partitions in your own consciousness you will experience the other dimensions of these communications as things that will drip or leak into your experience as assistive age as you progress in your life that is stirred up a couple extra questions on this topic all right question number two is there an energy exchange between us in a sense information being exchanged beyond the word being spoken anything beyond information healing soothing calming energy I feel the idea more of a conducive atmosphere to allow you to heal yourself for as we have said no one ever healed you always heal yourself you may use someone as an elaborate externalized symbol to allow yourself in an acceptable way to do so but you always created all the disease the cure the person doing the quote unquote curing but the person assisting in the healing all they are quote unquote actually doing in a sense is providing a conducive atmosphere around and about an individual to allow them to exercise their ability to heal themselves they may ascribe what having then done so that you have healed me but that is not from our perspective the actual mechanism now this is not to say that healers are not of service yes they are providing that conducive atmosphere in that way is a great service you may say in a sense that's what we do more or less provide the conducive atmosphere but you will always make the decision and you will always only derive whatever benefit from your own willingness to apply and act upon what you do now question number two oh all right perhaps this is two eight okay probably I'm going to have to ask it a little securitously I'm trying to open up I want to open up all the way all the way all right I'm not going to try to do it well there's a play I've gone farther I've progressed with it and they said before it's much easier for me in my session and when I'm with my children I feel like my life is still so demanding and that you know the bombarding of this child wants this thing phone may I project yeah even that sometimes I can do even that and sometimes especially when they're being defiant and not cooperative when we're not in a flow together then it becomes difficult to open up at times sometimes I can do it and it's incredibly powerful and beautiful with them and inspiring and other times by the way that is a new new one therefore now that you are finding even that sometimes you can do so you are beginning in that sense to progress along those lines before you do prefer to do it okay I cannot see that you have progressed in that way yeah or allow yourself to acknowledge that and do understand that's what left of this are issues that you might say are advanced class stuff these issues in and of themselves even that are the issues that will allow you right now the greatest growth so you can bum out when they happen or you can rejoice that the opportunities are so repetitive and begin to take them and use them as opportunities all point of view all right I'm still trying to get you are trying an awful lot and as we have said all the trying is not the doing of the same simply the doing of trying there is a distinction you don't need to try that implies effort simply be there's a fear that stops the being all right very good even that serves you what is the feeling let's get out of it with my children that they're going to take over is that actually possible it could happen in what way you perceive them sending you to school and then saying literally could that actually happen let's play worst case scenario my daughter won't get ready for school all right and if I don't you know keep reminding her reminding her and then she you know she's like a donkey stubborn donkey sometimes and I'm in you know in my heart up to a point and I get frustrated by the way your donkey the harder you pull the more they sit the more you simply allow and perhaps as you say coax them along the more in that sense you get a shall we say preferred respond your analogy I am simply utilizing do you understand yes I therefore you can in that sense lovingly coax each and every time with the purest of intention and perhaps afford yourself a little more of the period of timing in your morning to allow that coaxing to take place is there any way I can help rather than the coaxing because the teachers all find that as well put the stress on everyone around well the idea is a coaxing and again we mean this quite colloquially if it comes from a loving space and is repetitive and consistent you will find there to be a response but if there are gaps and hold in that approach the unconditional lovingly supportive approach that is what seems to perpetuate that state of mind when there begins to be a response from your change of your action toward you you will also find it to spill over into your school all right let me catch the essence of the question oh I would like to be no I'd like to be able to relax and trust the positive all the way there's a place where I can take in and let myself receive and then it stops at a certain point where there's a fear I don't know what the fear is oh I define right now it is no accident we are speaking about this and perhaps we can use it to illustrate the idea of transforming the fear because you can't get rid of it I guess you know for lack of more specific would be the ultimate fear of the positive that it's maybe not there that I the ego has to do it all or something well in a sense your ego will always be involved for your ego is the portion of your personality that keeps you focused in physical reality the complication arises when you overload it with work in that sense that is not in its domain so you can simply allow it to do its job in keeping you focused and make your own decisions in a conscious way all right maybe I'll take it from another angle from my question last time what I what I did was I stopped the rigidity of my day I really went with the flow of in every moment you know being with each child or being with myself in the way I perceived was the real call the real need there what happened was all kinds of paperwork piled up I lost my keys for five days I forgot to make my IRS payment I mean I never do this kind of stuff I seem to though I lost a certain grounding in it and then that part of my mind says see what happens when you just let go to that guy all right but why does one thing have to do anything with the other simply that you define that it would okay in other words you can say I must do one but then I cannot do the other than you are writing the rules that one must be mutually exclusive of the other and that is simply a belief but understand the other belief is that you have what you need to have when you need to have it you know what you need to know when you need to know it if you begin in that sense to not judge what is not being done and simply continue to unconditionally love and support you will find everything to begin to equalize this changes in the sense your habitual ritual and it takes shall we say a bit of time because you create time in that way for things to fall back into place in the new structure but if you in a sense put up your own roadblock and choose to define that because you have done this wonderful thing you blew that you are the one making the relationship all right that's the image that defines it that if I open up to trust the positives like loving then I will be taken over I'll lose my sense of balance my kids will take me over my paperwork will take me over that somehow there's the fear of loss of identity all right and also the concept that you can be taken over which from our perspective is impossible right so begin to look at the beliefs you prefer to have I can handle it anything I create by definition I can handle begin to look at the imaginary you and see how the imaginary you that believe that would act and begin to handle hand over those situations to the imaginary you one at a time watch what comes up and use this tool in that way okay I think it's the balance between the male and female I think that my misconception was that if I open up all the way that I'm falling too strongly into my female aspect and I'll leave you in one moment understand vulnerability from all perspective can be viewed as infinite strength when you are vulnerable you are entirely open to the universe when you are entirely open to the universe the universe withholds nothing from you so the concept of vulnerability in and of itself need not bring with it a negative connotation and you can understand again that you can only be overwhelmed when you create being overwhelmed and since you are technically creating that you are not truly overwhelmed so that makes sense so that's right I'm not truly overwhelmed I'm not really sure if you are creating the notion of being overwhelmed since you are creating that you are even controlling that therefore you are not truly overwhelmed if we playing out that belief but I think that what happens is we are evolving here and myself personally is that I don't open up all the way so I open up well if you only open up to the universe partially then the universe can only deliver partially to you so understand the relationship understand the new definition of vulnerability as simply being open to all possibilities therefore being able to receive all possibilities and again view the notion of that you could possibly create a reality that you cannot handle which again from our perspective is impossible by definition if you create it you can handle it all right I want to I want to imprint that in my consciousness all right well again the imaginary referential preferential you tool will be most helpful for you can see how you are acting in that situation you can see how the imaginary preferred you act in that situation and you can decide that perhaps you like what the imaginary you is doing better and it is always the doing the actions that create physically the reality all right one final give yourself other option yes one final question on that to me to be the visualization of what a being would look like if they walked around like that in my mind would be like someone from a society all right but you understand that there is a human a form representation of it that is why you are able to even hear a word we are saying because you can attain it as well and if you will simply perhaps increase the height of that image and add some hair in that sense you will be a little bit closer to what is available to me all right so that person would in the preferential you would be me how would they stand how would they walk how would they speak being unconditionally loving to other individuals how would they perceive when others seemed to be saying negative things to them for understand negative things can be said to you but they will only affect you when you buy into them from your end so what is your willingness to buy into them simply look at every characteristic nuance of the referential preferential you and begin to mimic it simply begin to be the you you prefer to be using the screen the projector of your imagination to lay down the template then why does Andrew need quietness when he goes into this state because that's how I feel if I'm going to be this vulnerable and everyone to be quiet and positive you know that's my image well again to address the immediate question in order for us to be able to maintain and establish a focus through the mentality of shall we say physiological channels that we communicate with and through their need be by definition a slight softening of their focus of their foothold if you will on the forefront of their consciousness so the relaxation is simply a matter of that loosening up of that lightning up of the diffusion of the immediate focus so that in that sense we can assume that focus innocent is there a similarity between that and when I'm talking about walking really other than when you will sit down close your eyes and take free deep breaths you break the momentum that you typically in your society say results in you being reactive rather than active and again as we have shared with you several times the breath is key breathing is key it is not only the movement of air which it also is an oxygenation system for those of you who like that idea but it is the exchange of energy with the environment itself it is a physiological symbological representation of your willingness to integrate your female and male energies female in a sense being represented by inspiring inspiration and out flowing male action oriented energy being loosely represented by the action of expirations the breath is key so to the very much thank you and to you as well for your ongoing willingness to begin to crack open this egg and we thank you I was looking at a picture of the entire magazine of a total solar eclipse and one of the things that scientists will puzzle was I'll come down side of it with much time to the inside of it this is a discovery in that sense that you will make and we will not tread upon it however we will point out that interestingly enough when you seem to cover nine tenths of that particular symbol the other one tenth loosely speaking reveals things even though it is covered that you could not have seen prior therefore you may look at an eclipse in a sense as obscuring your vision but you may also relate it to the idea of expanding your vision what I was referring to was your knowledge of the temperature of the sun within and without its own core the center inside the sun all around the sun in heat waves or temperature or Fahrenheit or whatever temperature system you guys use or we're going to shoot two hours I might hear my question not really okay can you clarify yes this time it is warmer in the outside or is warmer in the inside is true that it real inside of it is cool and if so how can we so have in the outside asking the question so we understand we are simply in that way scanning what is available to us through the channel in there is not much if you will give it a moment the closest translation that we can render in this particular instance is for you to understand that many of the reactions that take place in a sense chemically speaking that result in the phenomenon you label your son involves a flow both inwardly from the perimeter and outwardly from the core and there is an exchange of particular styles of energy that have characteristic shall we say results one of them being that you can actually have a hotter perimeter than a core it is more shall we say directly related to particular interactions of electromagnetic flow that you are only now beginning in that sense to explore therefore there is not much vocabulary in that sense to communicate it but was this helpful at all we in that sense will lead in that sense the channel toward other material that will enable us to have the vocabulary to answer that more completely and we ask in that sense if you find yourself present at a future interaction that you ask again and we thank you for the opportunity in that sense to find a particular point at which we could see at the channel and with us if you are a society one of demons highly evolved of all the extraterrestrial no no no no no no We are in that sense, middle of the road, so to speak. Let's do understand again that you are treading on the infinite. From the perspective of wherever you are in any of your creations, in any of your manifestive realities, there will always literally be an infinite amount higher and an infinite amount lower. And this again does not sit very well with finite minds for it is an infinite concept. And by definition, it is, shall we say, that affinity exists within infinity and therefore can only in that sense comprehend certain aspects of it, whereas infinity can comprehend finite aspects. Can I ask another question? You cannot. Can you explain what death is on your planet, it is at all? It is simply similar to your idea, though we do it consciously. We understand what our explorations are more directly. We understand when we have fulfilled in that way, what it is we have chosen to explore and simply literally enter that state with eyes open, simply lay down and transform. You can do this also. But it is much the same as you, we have what you would label birth, growth, and then death in our reality at this time being that we are still also physical. But the difference in our approach toward it is being conscious of it, not fearing it for we understand the eternal nature of our soul. And we also in choosing to create less forgetfulness of ourselves from other portions of ourselves do so more conscious or perhaps remain more conscious. In between lives, we also create a notion that you would label in this time track reincarnation and tend to reincarnate back into our society at this time at least. But there is far more of a communication between the individuals still alive and the soul who is quote unquote about to be born. And because again we do so consciously and understand that it is simply not the end but simply walking in a sense through a door. We do not bring along with our aging process the degradation of our physical bodies. There is some shall we say physiological representation of age but it is not debilitated. Our approximate life span by your years would translate to 300. That is the physiological potentiality for your human body though at this time you realize but one-third of that. Now what you experience upon physicalized death is literally at the moment it occurs what you believe to be most likely. In this physical reality when you believe something you create because you are experiencing and exploring time and timing a time lag seemingly between the having of the belief and the manifestation of the reality. But when you are in that state the in between state shall we say there is no corresponding time lag. Immediately what you believe manifest fully you are a thought form and a sea of thought energy in that state. So therefore you immediately shall we say get what you put out. Because we are conscious we choose to consciously create even the death experience. What we are sharing with you is that you can too. If you will begin to view your unconscious creation and allow them one by one to become conscious by the time you are ready to transform in that way you will have the option of remaining conscious. If you allow yourself to have a 50-50% of unconscious belief systems through which you are functioning from then it will be as you say the luck of the drama. Does that make sense? Yes. Does that answer the question? Yes. If there is something more you wish to explore along these lines. No. I need to digest what you said. Well, all right. Have a good talk. You don't need to get in digesting. Emilyment. Shady. You sure? You. Do your society have to deal with problems of poverty, ignorance, vandalism, or say depression, anger? No. Thank you. But the idea is that our particular exploration was never quite as focused or never did we impose such limitation upon ourselves from the beginning. There was earlier in what you might consider to be our history a representative, shall we say, symbol that you might call disease, but it was very short lived and in that sense no longer exists in any form upon our planet as we perceive your society to be going within the next hundred or so of your years. Is that all? All right. Over there. My physical body is in my soul. Okay. Now you can create the appearances that your soul is within your body, but it is only independent. Why is it in the physical body in my soul? Yes. So I am located also simultaneously. In many, many, many, perhaps you can say infinite ideas, but what this exploration is being in this physical reality is literally imposing by choice, by the way, on a higher self level, a forgetfulness of 99.9999 and the figure runs on and on of your totality so that you can focus on the point 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, et cetera, 1%. So I have chosen to stay within this ego focus at this time. At this time, yes. Thank you. Now from the totality of your higher self, from the perspective of your over soul, it is all happening simultaneous and right now. That is why we say in your timeline, you can call it reincarnation. It seems that you incarnate for a period of time, die, and reincarnate. So within that framework or structure of physicalized time, you may say reincarnation. However, from the perspective of your totality, your higher self, or as we have said, over soul, it is all simultaneous. So what you would label here as reincarnation, your higher self would label multiple simultaneous incarnation. Thank you. And to you. Shady. Yes, sir. I kind of created a situation where looking for waves to inspire others to change to the more wholesome diet. And I wonder if I've seen my creativity as well. And I wonder if there are no waves that I can open to my creativity. Very simple. Be a living example of that which you speak. So that individuals simply do not hear words which they may, depending upon their belief system, feel to be quite empty. However, if you are a sparkling, shining flesh and bones, example of what you are saying, that carries far more weight. The idea also of creativity is that you are always 100% creative. Simply, perhaps you can look at what it is you wish to create and begin to focus your thought in a particular direction if that's what you see. But again, you are always 100% and totally creative. Though when you create realities unconsciously, that result in unpreferential effects, you tend to think, well, that's not very creative. From our perspective, it's very creative. So it will just come. I mean, no, no. Be an example. In that sense, if you truly believe what you are saying and what you wish to share, then it will be effortless for you to be an embodiment of it. And again, when people see, well, my goodness, I've heard people say that, but look at her. She actually does it. Look at her. She's right there. I can see her. I can feel her. That is the strongest opportunity that you can afford them to choose if they wish that alternate reality. For again, you can never force anyone to choose anything. Simply present it. And if you believe in the power of the idea that you are presenting, you need not argue it. It simply carries its own weight. That's good for people who have seen me, but now that's where people have done it when it's written in the book. And it tends to go into the book. Well, the idea is to incorporate perhaps some of your own experiences into the idea. As examples of what you have just shared. Okay. Thank you. The. Yes. Oh. Then it will be but a few more shares. Share. Sure. Can you explain? You may have said this, and I maybe forgot. Oh, I just never repeat. How we deal with, in this physical reality, we cut our fingers and it's bleeding and it hurts the lot. Oh, you're saying we are capable of almost, I don't know if we call it witness consciousness, of not feeling the pain by being in that somehow getting to a higher state where the pain is just, could you, could you? Yes. Yes. You can do that, but the idea will be to first use even that exactly as it is, as we have said. If you cut your finger and it hurts, look at it, look at what it means to you, look at what you would do, leads, who have done it, look at in that sense how it serves you. And again, we understand this is not the common approach. Individuals do not scrape their knee and say, how does this serve you? But if you begin to do so, you will notice a pattern. When you find how something serves you, guess what? You can serve yourself in another way. And then not need to create that particular symbol to allow yourself to serve yourself. So therefore, when you find something you label, for instance, to extrapolate this idea as this ease, you can simply look at it as a symbol. You are telling yourself something. If the disease hangs around, you're not getting the message. So do not fixate on what it is not. When you get the message of what it has allowed you to do, what belief it has allowed you to hone in on, it will transform. So in that way, you will use even that and not need to then create that symbol. When you establish what it is you are showing yourself, you will find through your creativity that there are many, many, many non-traumatic ways to create the same effect. And if you will simply be willing to create that effect, first you will then not create the quote unquote need for that particular symbol. And those symbols, this ease, cutting yourself, physicalized pain, are symbols which you use to force yourself to look at something that you have refused to look at. So therefore, make it conscious. And then choose to do it on purpose. See? I feel a lot of inner peace. But I do not feel that I am able to communicate that to the people around me. Well, in a sense, you understand that it is beyond words if you feel inner peace. It is simply, shall we say, a frame of being a state of mind which is on many subtle levels visible to other individuals. But how would one be able to make other people feel more peaceful? Well, when you say you experience inner peace, do you then utilize and apply that by demonstrating outer peace? Not necessarily. Ah, that is the idea. People cannot see what is inside. They see what is outside. So be willing to midwife that inner peace to your outer reality. When you find yourself not abiding by the inner peace, use even that to define and determine what you believe that you wish in that sense to transform. But again, a living example. People in that sense will immediately see you as a beacon of inner peace when you are the expression outwardly of that inner peace. Now, that again does not mean you need to berate yourself when you fall short of that inner peace. You can use that. If you are berating yourself, in general, you won't give yourself the opportunity to use it. Is that completely satisfactory or is there more that we can explore? I think it is satisfactory. I am thinking sort of like this woman did in terms of children and teenagers and trying to communicate a sense of their own selves to themselves and to help them to be calm and accepting of themselves. Understanding a little of this on a more elemental level. May I illustrate something? If you are interacting with any particular individual, any particular individual and seeming to get the same response, the same effect, in general in your society you say, well, they are doing the same thing and do not then look at the fact that so are you. You cannot change them. But if you will change your contribution to what is resulting in the same old effect, by definition it must change. They will not have the same wall in that sense to bounce off of. So if you will simply change even a minor nuance of your approach, you will see an immediate effect and immediate difference in the overall effect and that will give you, shall we say, enough encouragement to you. So take it back home and you will find something very interesting. All of you and this goes across the board. When you are willing to make a change, and I do not mean conceptually and then act the same old way, when you are willing to make an outward change to act upon that which you prefer and perceive you wish to be, others will seem to change. Immediately. For you are only interacting with all others on whatever level you are at, they match that level of their totality. So when you act from a different level, you actually interact with a different level of the same individual and that gives the appearances that they have changed. No, you have changed and you are now allowing yourself to see and interact with that aspect of them. But you do not afford yourself that opportunity if you keep doing the same old thing. Is that a morris? Yeah, very helpful. Oh, have a good time. Chip, is love the only thing that exists? In a sense, unconditional love you may say is the stuff that this dream is made of. It is the very fabric of creation, but again allow us to draw the distinction between unconditional love and conditional love. Unconditional love means no matter what you do, I may not prefer it, but I will still allow you to have your valid exploration. I may not condone it, I may not even hang around with you, but I will at least validate it. Conditional love is, if you do this I will love you if you do not use think. Therefore, from our perspective, the universe is not made of conditional love, but it is a product and in fact, the very fabric and the white light of creation that you sometimes hear about is in fact unconditional love. It is the very glue of creation. It is what allows, shall we say, the coagulation of non-physicality into physicality. It is what allows all the attractive forces throughout the multiverse, unconditional love. So the long winded answer is yes. Thank you. Shady. For sure on that same project, do we translate that into energy? If it is energy, it is love energy, it is an energy force. It is an energy, but it can also result in an attitude, and that attitude will result in particular actions. And it is the actions in your reality that actually, shall we say, nuts and bolts-wise, creates the reality. Again, the way you structure the prism that breaks down that unconditionally loving white light is with three sides. Belief systems, emotions and thoughts. You begin with belief systems that result in particular emotions. Those emotions result in a particular thought pattern, but that thought pattern results in your action. So it is the actions that create the realities, but you can always trace it back to the belief. But that answers the question. I guess I'm trying to get to the purest form, pure universal unconditional love, that that is the pure energy. You may say, yes, that it is pure energy, and understand that matter is simply another form of energy. That is why when we say, it is the stuff the stream is made of, we mean it literally. And your scientists have already begun to find this out. That matter is simply another form of energy. As for you. Shady. Shady, do you have a equivalent of hair, water, fire, herd and your planet? Yes. Do you use and control them as a totality of energy or individually or collectively? Perhaps not so much fire anymore, but the others, yes. Good. Thank you. And to you. Yes. I have a question for a friend of mine who's about 70 years old, is suddenly and quite quickly deteriorated from what has been diagnosed as Alzheimer's disease. How does this serve? In a sense, it is the beginning of this transition to non-physicality in that way. And sometimes, though you do not have to, by the way, do this, individuals will, shall we say, loosen their grip a bit at a time. That symbol in general is representative of the loosening of the pinpoint focus of consciousness that you create. But again, you can ask him as well. You can say, I know what you don't like about this, but just for a moment, let's play a game. What do you actually get out of it? And if you can word it in quite a neutral way, you will find out there is something quite obvious. I'll try that. Thank you. All right. You do not have to try. Just do. Shady. For sure. What is exchanged between two human beings and sexuality besides the physical experience? Unconditional wealth. In a sense, empathy, identification, not with, but as in that moment. It is in a sense one of the ultimate forms in this physicality of the union of consciousness. Depending upon, again, the approach of the individuals involved. It can be quite mundane in your society according to, again, the meanings, the significances and the belief systems around it, but potentially. It's beautiful. I was talking to a friend and she was believing that there's information exchanged. Candy. Candy. Candy. In general, it will be somewhat unconscious and, again, drift or leak into the consciousness, the conscious awareness of an individual down the line. Or perhaps in your sleeping dream reality. Thank you. And you as well. At this timing, allow us to, again, express to you our unconditional love and appreciation for your willingness to co-create this information. To create this interaction with us. Though, again, you may perceive that I am creating the interaction that is not so. For again, without you all, there would simply be an individual sitting here in a chair in an empty room. And there would be no co-creation, no interaction. Everybody is equally a teacher and a learner. And if you can understand this and will allow yourself to see this, you will always give yourselves many opportunities. Even when you are, quote unquote, teaching to be open to what you can learn. For understand, as you may feel that you are learning certain things from these interactions and, in a sense, by the way, more appropriately you are remembering what you already know. We too are enriched by the different ways in which all that is manifests itself throughout the multiverse. Each and every one of you is an entirely unique, perspective, and entirely unique relationship of energy. And it enriches us greatly to be able to relish and swim in the sea of your consciousness. If you will view for but a moment in your daily activities and your upcoming days, what we had discussed earlier in this interaction, and find the phrase at your disposal, even that, you may find it to be quite helpful. For everything is of service, even that. Everything. You can, if you wish, play a game and hide from yourself what service it is. But if you will, just for a moment look at what it even might be, you will begin to see how obvious it is. And how things actually do serve you just as much as they are a drag. So begin, in that sense, to make conscious your creations. Begin to take the ones that you do not prefer and own them and transform them. Can't get rid of them, but you can integrate them. You can have them contribute to the equation that you are without needing to feel the isolated effects of them. So therefore, go forth in that sense and relabel. For your willingness again to interact with and bid you, amos fond and loving. Good evening.
