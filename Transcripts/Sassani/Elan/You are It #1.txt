 All right, I'll say, greeting to you this evening of your time as you create time to exist how audios. Oh, thank you very much. Allow me to begin this interaction with the following. We have discussed many times, many ideas, but one of those ideas is the fact that you can only experience a reality that you are already the vibration of. You will always attract to you just exactly that that you are absolutely able and absolutely qualified in that way to explore and to in that sense experience. One idea that we wish to share this evening is in a sense a bit of a paradox in the way that it is usually viewed by your situation and perhaps in discussing it from this particular point of view, it will allow you just enough of a change in perspective to begin to get a different effect. Much of what we are discussing has to do with what you sometimes label processes whereby you feel you must undergo a particular process in order to achieve a certain idea. Therefore allow us to begin as follows. Your near ability to imagine something is your indication that you are of that vibration. You simply again cannot experience any reality that you are not the vibration of even in your imagination, even with your desires. So therefore in any given moment that you project a particular version of who you are that you prefer in the moment that you actually create the ability to picture it, you are it. Now very often in your society there is many definitions that say that initially a particular momentum will begin with an idea, you will experience a series of steps or processes that then will allow you to experience that idea and this is also one valid way to explore and one valid way to discover who it is you are. But understand that you can if you wish many individuals prefer the process for it allows them to validate the change, simply understand that your mere ability to conjure it up, your mere ability to desire it which is an emotion behind the belief that it excites you is your indication that in that moment that you are able to even picture it you are it. Now if you simply will take this recognition and as you say run with it you can then begin acting as though you would assume a person who was already that way would act and get the result of immediately being that you. But when an individual thinks of a particular idea that they perhaps strongly desire they are in that moment that idea they are the vibration of that idea. Very often they will then plug in the assumption that that idea is something to be achieved not understanding that the mere ability to perceive it means you are it you can only perceive something if you will become identified completely with the vibration of that idea. So the moment you picture a preferred you you could only even do so were you already that you enabling you to then picture how you already are. Or again being simultaneously and containing it all you can express this in whichever way you want whichever way you desire but the mere solidifying it down to a solid idea and presenting that idea to yourself in the form of a desire is all the indication you need to simply continue to be that idea not again need to achieve it which is as valid an exploration but very often when we discuss things of this nature with members of your particular society and other societies you seem in that sense to be in a great rush. So therefore what can be quicker than instantaneous transformation nothing. So therefore whatever it is that you can feel excited about not only are you the vibration of that idea most literally to be able to perceive it but also that desire tells you that you are able to handle it you have every prerequisite that you can possibly need in order to fulfill that reality the desire itself can also be viewed as your indication to yourself that you have the ability. And another idea that we have shared is you simply do not create a reality you cannot handle and anything that you create within your reality by its mere existence in your reality allows you to know that you can handle it if you assume that you cannot and proceed in action with that belief you may create the effect of seemingly not being able to handle it but the paradox in irony is that you are handling even that you are handling the idea of not being able to handle it sounds again like semantics and it is in a sense also semantics but it can also be a concrete concept. So therefore if you have any notion in any form of who it is you wish to be assuming that you are not quite happy with how you are then you can understand that you need simply again utilizing the tool of your imagination to extrapolate how one would act to simply then continue to act as that you you will already be that you and your imagination again being a personal tool a personal methodology through which you can utilize what is present in your reality and make certain choices in a positive way is tuned to the vibration that you are. So therefore when you conceive of an idea you are it in that moment and you therefore possess the imagination that you need the portion the version of your imagination that you need to allow you to continue to use that imagination along the same vibratory line. So therefore perhaps now you can save yourself a bit of time and perhaps also when reflecting back on games of what you might call your childhood where an individual perhaps said you are it from now on you can say thank you very much yes I am. Therefore it all ties back to the fact that everything is all one thing contained within the whole it is all an extension of you and therefore you get to choose which portions of it have particular relevance to who you are and when you go to the extent to decide that you wish to be a certain way you are honing in on one particular bandwidth of frequency of all the available frequencies in your reality and you are literally literally even a know just to the sense of your radio dial tuning yourself into that portion of yourself. So therefore if you simply set the dial if you wish you can go forth and broadcast your new reality. So again we remind you your mere ability to conceive of a particular idea is indicative of the fact that you are that idea. This may be quite helpful for individuals who develop the desire which means they also have the ability to simply simplify their reality and begin to consciously create from the now moment for utilizing the fact that you are all ready it allows you to maintain your anchor your grounding in each and every moment and as we have often shared allowing yourself to remain grounded in the moment allows you to begin to glean the positive opportunities that each and every moment holds. So therefore if you now wish to consciously create a process and put it off into the future understandably set the mechanism is that that is the only way you will accept the change the steps that will allow you to allow yourself to already be it. So you do this either way but what we are suggesting is you can cut out or perhaps not create to begin with intervening time that you often complain about. Therefore let that sink in on whatever level it will understand that it is a liberating notion for it allows you to simply be who you wish to be in any given moment and if you find yourself after having become the new preferred you viewing a situation which may seem similar to a negative situation in the past remember you are now the new you therefore if you have a reaction which seems similar to the old you by definition it is the new you trying on so to speak an old idea but because you are the new you it will never truly be the old you experiencing it again it will be the new you creating the security to understand that you can still experience anything even the old reality and if you truly are acting as the new preferred you if you find yourself beginning to have a reaction that perhaps you do not prefer simply take a breath stop yourself so to speak conjure up in your imagination what the preferred you would do and this will come quite easily for again you are now already it you are that preferred you when you see what the preferred you would do it will be quite simple to do that instead for because it is a preferred you you will simply love what the preferred you does that will make it most effortless to do something different in a quote unquote similar seeming situation and remember whenever you do something different in a similar seeming situation you cannot help but get a different outcome which will then allow you to see that it was not the same situation it was the new you trying on perhaps you can say some old clothes and then perhaps deciding to retire those clothes to goodwill it is up to you in how you wish to analogize it is that clear therefore we will simply proceed to allowing you to be who it is you have chosen to be in co-creating this interaction with us allow us to also express our unconditional love and appreciation for your willingness to do so and understand if you like these ideas again you can only perceive something if you first contain it so you are already the person even in being able to understand what we are saying and absorb it that can put these ideas into application into action into practice and it will always be that action or the application of any of the ideas that are ever shared with you that will determine physically the new you so when you become that vibration I would assume that your actions will now be reflective of the new vibration and you will always give yourself a system of checks and balances to see if this is so and if it is not so you need not despair you can simply understand again that you are just checking to make sure that you can still create the old reality even though it may be a bit unpreparantial individuals do not wish to lose the ability to create even the misery therefore you will always allow yourself to see that it is possible though perhaps you will pick from a different set of probability you are perfect creators perfect you always create perfectly as we have shared even if you create misery it is perfect misery therefore you can create perfect joy by even having the notion perfect ecstasy by even thinking that it might be possible you begin to tune to that vibration by then looking at perhaps what an inner objections come up and handling them owning them and viewing what beliefs you have that allow you to continue to withhold constant ecstasy from yourself this will allow you to experience that all the time this also can be instantaneous it will be up to you for your willingness to share with us in this manner and co-create interactions both within our situation and out in your external so to speak lives I ask you now how may I be of service to you? Hi how are you today? Greetings perfect from the public access channeling that was done recently a group of us came met in Southbury in a board of directors room and came up with a letter well how exciting may we make a suggestion we would wish in this sense to structure these particular interactions at this location to begin the second half of the interaction with such a discussion so therefore not to interrupt there are no interruptions but is there something else you wish to share now and we will focus particularly on that idea at the beginning of the second time? I do have to remember stuff. Do share. Okay I talked to somebody on the phone who has a cousin who is a general close to the president of the United States who gave him top secret information and I want to ask you a few things. In Nevada at a military base where Hangar 18 is located evidently a leader of one of the extraterrestrial groups working at the military base married a lieutenant who works there and had a child with blonde hair with humanoid to speak English and another native tongue of their civilization whatever that tongue is can you elaborate on that a little bit? Initially upon sensing of this idea we have no recognition of it. Okay. Is it true that during the Reagan term in office a spaceship landed at the White House and met with the president? Not exactly not. Okay. Understand by the way that in the aspect of the dissemination of information and the shall we say attempts to keep that information from reaching the public there are many misinformation and distortions of existing information. Some of them in a sense are purposeful others are simply misunderstandings based on the momentum that seem to be created behind the this or misinformation but again this is only our perspective. The other thing this is all information that was given to me the extraterrestrials are in Nevada so they're using a nuclear fusion crystal engine which makes their craft like not from again our understanding that would be in a sense and we do not mean this as better or worse a step back in the current technology it simply is not necessary. Okay this is kind of weird can you tell us about fountain pen files on Elvis Presley and is it true that Elvis is not dead in the middle of the view of trying at the bottom in the end of the story. Oh, fascinating. So we're working with the extraterrestrials and the crewmen. Our perception is that that individual has physically translated and we are not aware of the files that you mentioned. Again this does not mean they do not exist they are simply not to our awareness. This is my final thing I was doing to hear. Oh, with the even weird. And under the fan we love weird. Oh, wow. But it's much much fun on the spacecraft during the golf door without public knowledge and the things working with our military in Nevada they love strawberry, supposedly they love strawberry ice cream and it's only soft food and also according to this information they like certain kinds of pudding except rice pudding. Well do understand that at least in the following presentation that you have just rendered there is at least some from our perspective fact that being the predisposition towards strawberry from particular civilizations including our own. Our again perception is that your president no does not have that direct communication to have actually quote unquote been flown. That's all I have to share with you. Oh, and we thank you for your creative share. Shredding. Alon. Good evening. Greetings. I read in the last 24 hours I have a situation come up that has been repeated quite a few times and it's been very negative. Oh right. In other words a particular neutral set of circumstances that you have chosen to interpret as negative. Do proceed. That's exactly one of those things I use. But anyway in this situation because of the material that I've been learning and using I was able to react very differently. Perhaps you then acted. I use a statement like that I said this is a neutral situation I assigned meaning and I determined this assignment positive. Now if you understand before you proceed that we are not saying that there are certain neutral occurrences which are not automatically labeled as negative by the majority of your society nor would that in a sense be an incorrect assumption for negative can simply mean non-integrative. But what we are suggesting is that all symbols being neutral do contain both and not to simply leave it in the neutral position but to look at actually what is of service about it which in general will not be the first approach. Yeah. But this time it maybe it wasn't quite the first but it was the second and the stronger. And the results were wonderful the whole situation. The whole situation. The there were a lot of positive things that came out of it that couldn't have come any other way and couldn't have come without the experience happening. All right. Being transformed. It was great because it really helps to convince me of how well this works. I've become aware that there's always positive lurking around no matter what. Look. All right. Do you wish to share a bit more specifically so that others may benefit from your experience. Well you mean describe the situation as much of it as you are a comfortable share. Well we have tenants and we ran apartments and one apartment is down in front and in front of it is a lawn and the driveway comes to the lawn and the tenant has many times driven over the lawn and ruined it and and the female of the couple I have had quite a few routes with over this. And a little shortcut. So a day ago she backed down over the lawn and she left a huge rock which I discovered yesterday afternoon she really ripped up a lot of the lawn. And I put a couple of chairs there and I was quite upset at first. And then I went to bed and I thought about it very positive would be before I went to sleep. And when I got up I felt very different. And it came to me to call her and ask her another question and I felt very loving. I called her with the intention of asking her something else I really wanted to ask her and she was so different toward me because she knew I would put the chair there so I knew what she did. She was just as nice as she could be on the phone. She apologized for what she did. She said she won't ever do it again and she felt terrible about it. And I asked her the question I had to ask and we had a very very loving positive conversation and feeling and it was really really nice. Well thank you. That is how simple it actually is. You can understand had you utilizing your own vernacular flown off the handle. Perhaps you would have gotten a more defensive response. But by maintaining your center and assuming you would only attract a situation that would be a positive service to you that would allow you to learn as all situations do something positive within yourself. You have simply as you have said transformed it most marvelous. And also now she'll take responsibility for taking care of a law and offer for her own sake because her viewpoint is different. She corrected herself at the time instead of me correcting her. Oh we thank you. I have another question. Do share. If all of our all my lives in existence now. Final thing. Do I live them one at a time? Well it is both this is one of the paradoxes within physical reality of the non physical overall infinite perspective. If you wish from one particular perspective of a timeline you have lived certain lives are living this one and will continue to live others many and other society altogether. But from the perspective of your higher self they all exist simultaneously. So when in that sense you wish to communicate with other aspects or other lives if you wish you can simply assume the higher self perspective and rather than reaching across the depths of time and space. You can simply understanding that from the higher self perspective they do exist right now that it is simply a matter of viewing another contiguous ongoing reality. And that may be shall we say an easier way to access some of these ideas. This is also why certain lives will bleed through or seem to bleed through or have a particular significance within a portion of this life for they are existing simultaneously and when the explorations are similar enough there can be what we sometimes will label bleed through. Now since you're in our future can you say if you want to and for some reason can you see the probable futures of and past in a sense you may say we have the ability to view probability. Yes. Everything is by agreement on the higher self level no exception. When you make an agreement to begin to honor your agreement with your higher self then it also becomes part of the agreement of the physical self. But when you deny this you do not act in accord with the agreement and sometimes it will seem like something is happening to you. But again paradoxically this is within the agreement. When you simply understand I must have made an agreement by definition then you begin to look around at why you made it how you made it and what it is and begin to act like you made it and then you therefore get the advantages of having consciously connected with having made the agreement. Did that translate? Yes. All right. What is the age of I a co? Approximately between 30 and 40 years there is no precise number known to this channel to draw from. I have one more question. Susan and I have been playing at trying to find out the commonality of one of our very ancient connections. Well, how far back did you choose? I was going back maybe one and thinking that maybe we have an association to do with horses. Oh, that would be one idea. But if you are truly speaking ancient perhaps you can use at the land. That's a starting place for shall we say everyone present in this room has had at least one and many times many past lives in at the land. In a sense this gathering and gatherings of these styles are the coming together of old friends who are now going to choose in a similar situation to make a different choice toward the positive. Your United States is quite at the same so to speak place so to speak as at the land. There are differences in the styles of technology but they are just as advanced in their own ways though it is our perception that this exploration will now be making the other decision not to blow yourself to as you say smithereen. Okay, thank you. So perhaps if you will just simply utilize whatever imaginary present itself from the projection screen of your imagination as to what would represent at the land is to you you will find some common ground. Is that ancient enough? Yes. Thank you. And to you. No. It's changed there than there. First thing I'll just share is I did a meditation today and I really believe that I in that make some kind of contact and self incredible unconditional love from you your planet. Incredible, yes. You must believe it to experience you did tap into our stream which is always available though you took us up on the office. Somewhat overwhelming. Not really again, you can always handle any reality, but perhaps you can say overjoying. Yeah, well, so thank you. Believe me when I say it was as equal a joy for us, for we always issue the invitation and yet shall we save few takers. So thank you for your willingness to act in whatever way and understand that your meditations are a form of action, though we usually suggest taking whatever inspiration occurs within that shall we say subdued form of action and putting it into application in your overall scheme of your life. So therefore, whatever it is you feel you gained, now determine how that can be applied. And when you apply it, whatever you have felt you have gained will feel gained tenfold. That will midwife it into physical reality. Also, we are still on the line. You can simply place the call anytime and to you. Will that be all for now? I have one. Well, I have a thousand, but just one more I want to ask and think about what you said tonight, the opening topic, which has really been on my mind. I am practicing imagining what I want to happen, what I want to, how I want things to be created, how I want to, but do understand one distinction before you proceed. When we speak about utilizing your imagination, we do not so much speak of it as laying down a template of particular specific expectations, but more utilize it to extrapolate how you would act in a particular given situation. So this utilizes things which are present in the physical reality and allows you to attune your vibration to the preferred you. It will then be your choice whether to act on it or not. But what we generally do not mean by the use of imagination is projecting very fine pointedly scenarios the outcome of which must occur in a certain way. And therefore, if a different outcome occurs, you will diss a point or self. Do you understand the distinction? Yes. Oh, I can translate this into actual problems here. Or situation, we in a sense are third density, word depth to the word problem, which assumes you cannot change it. And we simply substitute situation that you have not yet allowed to transform. Okay. Financial struggle. Oh, financial situation. And that I believe I have created to learn some lessons. Oh, I know. I prefer it's not. I think I've learned them. Well, in a sense, you can say if the symbol is hanging around, perhaps there is something that you have not yet gotten. Rather than focusing on the lessons you think you have learned, look at what you have not yet looked at. If you are assigning a particular label to a symbol which seems to repeat and feeling I've gotten the message, but it still seems to repeat, allow the external reality to be more obvious to understand that there is another message. So even though I say I believe I do not have to live with struggle, I choose abundance. I prefer abundance. And that feels like magical thinking in that I'm not. Well, that means on some level you believe it to be most unlikely. And there perhaps is the belief that you can hone down onto. I guess, traveling that into action that I need to pay. That's what I need. Well, simply by establishing your excitement in the moment and moving on at a momentum will in that sense begin behind things that are representative of your new vibration. But also, again, our definition of abundance is the ability to do what you need to do and does not include money as being the only way to do it. So our suggestions would simply be, again, to begin to act on what excites you. To begin to exercise your ability in whatever way you can do it, not necessarily one way. Look around at what other ways you can get the same thing done and express that ability. And then thirdly, again, simply from being willing to only do what excites you, there is an automatic support mechanism built into that from the universe who is more than willing to continue to provide all the support you need to continue to be who you are. So the seeming lack of abundance, which is simply another form of abundance, is more from the hesitation in your action than the actual going for it. Great. Oh. Thank you. And to you. Over there. Great. My question is about my own fertility. Oh. And my sister has asked questions for me. Have you understood and assimilated the answers we have already shared? Yes, I have. Can you share them with me, your version, what you understood was said? Well, I understood what you said, to look into why I wouldn't want to become famous. Oh, I have you done so. And I have done so. Did you come up with reasons? I have come up with reasons and then just miss them as that couldn't be it. Very good. Step one. Then what? And then now I need some advice because it's time. I'm ready to become pregnant and there's something that's happening that's happening. All right. Just not. Allow us to begin with the simplest of advice and please feel free to give feedback to it. All right. First of all, relax. Now, are you even feeling able to do that? Well, the idea is this. When you are speaking of the symbol of fertility, you are speaking of the allowance of procreation. You do not force procreation. It is an allowance. Allowance will always assume an open, relaxed, giving posture, not grabbing, holding, tight, forcing. You cannot force yourself to be fertile. You can simply allow your fertility, which already exists to express itself. Do you understand that distinction? Yes. And so therefore, round what you would label the sexual act is what we are speaking of. To in whatever way you will allow yourself to simply let go and relax. Does this make sense? Have you not in that way allowed there to be a great momentum of pressure within yourself about the need to have this happen? Yes. That brings itself even into the situations themselves. Because of the process and the time that I've been working on this, I think that the pressure has gotten a lot more. Well, this is what we are discussing. The pressure is inwardly self-imposed. It is a matter of holding on to particular ideas. When we say relax, we are not being condescending. We are saying simply loosen up. And only schedules, so to speak, if it even must be that rigid, those particular styles of interaction with your quote, unquote, mate in a spontaneous way when you are relaxed and simply willing to allow yourself to exchange and interact, inter-mesh, interweeds. There is something I have to share with you. I have to share with you. And we want to be very very savvy. So I am being intimidated by the days that I am fertile. All right. Well, even around that scenario, then understand that there need not be any pressure. And you can simply breathe, relax, and allow. And even thinking of the word, I allow this rather than I insist that it must be, will in that sense have an effect. However, we detect. Is your husband, as you say, sterile from an operation? I think he's sterile from having the most when he was... Oh, again, our perception is even though you have been told the opposite, that it would even be possible to be fertilized in that way. But that, in that case, the relaxation, the allowance, the loosening of the grip would need beyond both ends. Understand, being told such an idea, your husband, for instance, has him acting as though it is so, taking entirely and totally for granted that it is so, which is a self-fulfilling prophecy. It does not take, as you say, but one single cell to fertilize you. All right. So relax, have a good time if you wish. Whatever symbol will allow you to relax, simply utilize it as a tool. And this is all we'd have to do is just to relax. That's all. It is the tension and the stress and the pressure that is created from each individual that, in a sense, interferes in a sense with the natural flow. And flow will always only be a result of allowance. You cannot force things to flow. That is a contradiction in terms. Thank you very much. Oh, thank you. And happy birthday. Oh, thank you. Is that all? Yes, that's all. All right. Shitting. Yes, now you're listening. You're lying. You and Bisham have often referred in past. By the way, our perception is that at least for the time being, you are more approximating our feelings. Do proceed. Thank you very much. We do not perceive the likelihood of you shaving your head, but all right. It will come in another life anyway. So enjoy it while you got it. You and Bisham have referred in other interactions to the seven and a half cycle per second frequency. Yes, that is approximate, by the way. It is fluctuating between approximately 7.21 and 7.78 in there somewhere. It is a fluctuating figure. That is an average. Our normal operating state, our normal optimal operating state or vibrational frequency, seven and a half cycles or is it a harmonic of that? The idea of synchronizing would be to harmonize your shall we say much higher vibration with that vibration, a matter of synchronization identification. Yes. And that's dishonorable whatever we're involved in, whatever activity we're involved in. So it will always have a particular effect and that effect will be calming, inner piece alignment. And what is most productive? Yes. Well, in a sense you can say if you wish, there are different forms of productivity. So therefore that is arbitrary. But that would be what we call in our vernacular going with the flow. That's where you're letting it happen. You're letting the creative juices flow. But you need not to be so conscious of the idea. It can be quite automatic. In a sense you can say when you flawlessly and continually do what excites you, there is an automatic synchronization. Or you are automatically deciding consciously to allow yourself to be the vibration you chose. And that simply automatically fits in. When you resist who you are, that seems to create interruptions and fluctuations in your vibration that may then seem to be out of sync with the vibration of the planet. But when you are wholeheartedly being who you chose to be, it is perhaps you can say an automatic synchronization and alignment. So it need not be such a conscious effort. I see. Now that you've answered the question I was leading up to, could you elucidate on the mechanics of going out of sync with your natural vibration? It's really just that you're exciting. What actually takes place to cause the fluctuation in your vibrational freedom? Well, alright. Perhaps you can say on a wave length basis, when you have waves that are in sync, and again we will be as simple about this as we can, they will be enhancing synergistic. When you have waves that are out of sync, again colloquially, you create, shall we say, an interference wave, an entire third wave from the out of sync, is this at all addressing what you are asking? This is helping now. Is this a mental phenomenon, a physical phenomenon, an emotional phenomenon? Yeah. Okay, so it's one effect, the other effect, the other. Well in a sense your vibration would include all. So if one finds oneself feeling out of sort, the idea is to break the pattern at some level. You can do it by feeling different, or acting different, or thinking different, or actually calming your body down. And that's where the 3D breaths come in. That puts you back. In a sense you can use whatever portion of the triad, belief, emotion, and thought, or action. Yes. Yes. You can work it either way. This is why one of the ways we discuss to change your new beliefs is to work it backwards. Utilizing your imagination to determine what the new belief would have you do, and then doing that thing is in a sense working it backwards, in a sense. There is no truth forward and backwards. Alana, there are actually devices that are part of our culture that we're exposed to that would tend to disturb our normal vibration, but we have to counteract that. Well, that will be largely a product of your belief about them that creates the interference wave more than an inherent ability for that interference to be perceived. Feeling interfered upon will always in some way be a part of your own agreement as well. So therefore if you look at your belief surrounding that, then you can free yourself from the confines of those ideas. But individuals who strongly believe that yes will physically seem to experience the evidence of it being true. And it's also possible by changing your belief system to be very comfortable in the environment that you find yourself in all the time. Oh yes, but again the idea is owning your initial belief and then consciously choosing and changing to the new belief, not simply acting the new way as a denial of the old belief. And again, this is quite key. We discussed this a bit earlier this day with another individual that you will always own a belief before changing it. If individuals say, well, if I act the new way, I'm just fooling myself, I'm denying it, only if you have not first owned your original belief, then perhaps you can say you are not facing it or denying it. But if you own the new belief, feel what that new belief allows you to feel, project how that new belief then has you acting, you now own it, you've lived it, you put it down as a choice. Then by creating the new choice, you now have equal access to either choice and are not running from one choice, but are simply allowing yourself privyness to the choices. Thank you. And where are you tonight and who's with you for the craft? On this particular evening, we are, shall we say in an unidentified by your standards galaxy and we are observing a particular society and upon my craft at this time would be a female, two females and myself. One would be what would loosely be called my counterpart, which will be named in a sense soon and another would be one referred to as Ia. Thank you. Greetings to you all. And to you. Fimeo. Hi, Ilana. Greetings. Are you shining quite rightly? Just checking. I have a message from Richard and Joan. Oh. Thank you and Bishar for the idea of channeling to the Bish Barnard system. Barnard. Planet. Well, again, it was only an idea. Thank you to them for utilizing and applying it. It's been really fun. There will be many startling discoveries when they allow information back from that system for they are quite a bit more alien than you might imagine, though they do have many common ideas to your society. And let's see. They are providing you definition of unconditional love that I wanted to share. Right, always willing to share a new definition of unconditional love. Conditional love is going unconditional love. Unconditional love is allowing what you know to come into being. That's all that's it. Or. And we thank you all as well. For me, we had a flat there tonight and are you aware of this flat? We understand the symbology, yes. And I... By the way, perhaps very briefly in one or two sentences, you can explain this idea for those who may not be familiar with it. Full moon we have a group of friends and we get together and go into a flat lodge which is a don't like, kind of thing from Indian tradition. I think of Native American. It is of others, but also Native American, yes. Maybe Irish. Anyway. I...so that's what we do, go in and put hot rocks in and have fun. So in this, what I discovered together with the people there, a new grave that I'm not exactly sure what I can use it for, but I wanted to see if you have any perspective on. But not that. And we're trying, we were thinking of new words to call a workshop because workshop just didn't fit anymore. Oh, well we have suggested one, are you familiar with it? Playhouse. Oh, I have. Okay. No working, no shopping. How can do? No. Great. That's the word for that. Now we became up with was intra-journey, intra-journey. Oh, right. I don't know where the words fit do you know? What could be... Well, it is simply an indication of what a mass portion of your consciousness and... The external to be a reflection of the internal and consciously diving into it. That is intra-journey in a sense. Dejan. Oh, all right. Welcome to the moment. And while you are feeling that, understand that you are witnessing the simultaneity of your being. For in the moment that you are involved in what you labelate de Ja'vou, you are simultaneously within more than one reality. Welcome. Thank you. Other things. I discovered my future selves. Name. Oh, my. Which one? Which one? Kaysha. Oh, how exciting. And under the central love and messages. Receive. Thank you. Adjou. Yes, yes. Send love as well. And suggest that you turn inward for the larger message. Thank you. Adjou. Over there. Alon. One moment. One moment. New proceeds. Hi, Alon. I'm waiting. I'm a New Age activist. Oh, thank you. Thank you very much. Night, Denise. Oh, okay. Don't you believe him? He is a rather sneaky one. Alon, I've been walking the path of excitement quite a bit. Not a habit. I've been walking the path of excitement quite a bit. Not a 100%, but I've been doing, I think, a pretty good job. Oh, pretty good. All right. It'll get better. We are simply repeating your own judgment. Right. Among other things, I've run into. I was walking the path of excitement was a lot of critique. Dessert. Yes. Oh, I caged him. Keep your eyes open and you won't run into anything. And occasionally a lot of serious solemn advice as to the facts that I should be talking. The path of somebody else is excited. Yes, right. Before I, you know. There seems to be some kind of a consensus belief out there. Very pervasive. Only, by the way, in the moment that you buy into it, does it affect you? Thank you for that. Yes. But the belief I kept running into was that I must or you must walk the path of obligation before you can possibly walk the path of excitement. Well, it would seem that you had much experience in this regard. So now that you have done both, what do you choose? I choose the path of excitement. Oh, thank you. Yes. Thank you. And a couple of other questions. The matter of earthquake activity off of California code. What is your current assessment on probabilities for serious quicks, say, within the next few months? There is some probability in this regard. And again, you can act as a siphon or a valve to release some of the pressure through your own consciousness. Nothing is given in this regard. Right. Well, thank you. Then with regard to the 7.5 cycles per second, I have a new tuition that this is a healing frequency for a variety of reasons. One being the fact that the idea of earth is the idea, among other ideas, of continuous self regeneration. What I did correctly is that is one way to express it. So therefore you can utilize that analogy to understand that you contain that ability as well and begin to express it in whatever way you are comfortable. Right. Right. And finally, I remember always, quite fondly, the sharp joke of some years ago about the asisonic form chicken. Why did it cross the road to realize it was already on the other side? A little bit of a fourth density joke. I came up with a little joke in my office. Hello, I'm not your share. Okay. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. There's a book. Who's there? The old it is. Yeah, you and who else? Oh. We thank you. We thank you. Within the association perhaps there will be somebody who will find that view. Remember, there are many civilizations out there, all with a different perspective. And that will have some of them rolling in the isles, no doubt. Well, in that sense, if they do perhaps you will answer. Thank you. And... Shannen! Hey, it's Vima. Oh, Elon, I had a question about being pictured at Maui's channel. Oh, right. We have one at Richard's house, and it's of you, I believe. And your electromagnetic field is present there. Now, when I talk to you through the symbol of the picture, are you listening to you here? In a sense what you would be able to be a portion of my consciousness, in a sense, is directly communicating. But one of the reasons we generally refrain from the issuance of such ideas, icons, pictures, and those styles of symbols is that we wish not for them not to be placed upon anybody's pedestal. So therefore, as a sharing, as an identification, all well and good. But that is all. So therefore, feel free, though we need not have that direct visual contact to communicate. It's fun to work. But if it is fun, please have a good time. To have thinking of that, it's in way to remember that we have access, and the stream is there. Oh, perhaps from time to time you can tilt your own head down and communicate mind to mind. Another question or comment? I tried it. That was it. Are you there? I don't know. Oh. You're the only one who would. You're the one who would be there. We will return to you should the spirit strike you in that right. Oh, over there, feel free. Hi, Amher. Great to be here. On our planet and in our society, we have measures of intelligence like the IQ chat. I heard the old soul, the new soul concept. And when we saw this movie and it was 10th time they did, they used different percentages of the brain. And we said, well, I'm a 64% and this was to be the afterlife. It was 10th time. And I was wondering if you had any way, first of all, in difference in levels of intelligence and any means of differentiating? First of all, there is simply no background measurement by which other individuals are then compared. For we understand, first of all, that all individuals use 100% of their brain. Perhaps your measuring devices are only able to measure 10 to 30%, but this is simply, shall we say, a measurement issue. You always use 100% though perhaps in ways that have not yet been understood. Therefore, when you as a society set up an quite arbitrary state or set of parameters by which intelligence is measured, it is a very narrow measuring of the overall idea of intelligence. Individuals simply focus themselves in different aspects of their overall intelligence, but all individuals have inherent intelligence. Even ones who seem to have absolutely none, those that you sometimes label as autistic individuals are just as brilliant, just as intelligent as anybody though their focus is different and their definition is different. When they choose to then buy into your standard and then judge themselves by that standard, it can sometimes come up looking that they are judging themselves and experiencing the pain from that judgment, but that is only when making the comparison. Do proceed. Do you have, I kind of understand that and I agree very much with that. Do you have such diverse ways of like expressing empowerment, you know what I'm saying? Are you more focused in a linear way than in a similar way? We in general are less focused in a linear sense and far more in an intuitive spontaneous sense. That is our particular ilk or exploration at this time. Can, can, um, same such as mental retardation cannot exist in work sense. It can in a sense be in differing exploration though would never be labeled as such and judged by the society or by the individual. It would simply be a special individual choosing in that sense to interact with the society and at the same time create a separate experience. That is by the way what occurs on your planet as well, but needless to say there is a judgment again on both ends and this in general is what causes the discomfort. Sometimes also the particular state that you are speaking of of particular styles of what you sometimes call retardation. We understand that is less apropos these days but can also be from the individual in some cases. Some only some. The imposition on themselves of a particular style of retribution style karma for things that they have done to suppress and bottle up and oppress other individuals. So they will self impose what they perceive to be a style of self impression or oppression. Did that translate? Oh yeah very well. But it is also now that the experience is created a valid experience in and of itself and sometimes souls will simply choose to be in the society yet focused in a different reality. Is that clear? Yeah I really think that people could continue to choose that exploration. Well perhaps as your society begins to move into fourth density there will be less of a necessity on the part of individual thinking that it is a necessity to impose that style of physicality upon themselves and simply explore it for the mere joy of exploring it. For there is a joy in it some of what you were exposed to was just one minute cross section of those who are and shall we say somewhat of pain in feeling oppressed. But that is only a microcosmic expression of all these styles of expression. And again all these individuals are geniuses simply usually in one focused particular area if that area is something acceptable by your mass consciousness music science art then they understand this genius if it is simply an expression that has no translation in your reality then there is no way in that sense for you to understand it but that individual undergoing the experience does. Is that a decision? Yeah thank you. Is that all? Oh, shit it is. I want to. Please. Hello. I would like to keep my consciousness focused in the moment. All right go right ahead. And I have been doing that but many times when I do it I know. But, but, but, but. Yeah I know. Anytime you've been doing it and what else? And I'll find that my mind seems to drift off on automatic pilot and I'll be, and I'll notice that I'm focusing on the future or the past. Then what? What do you do then? Then I, well then I often say you know why just try to figure out what I did wrong and come back and focus on the moment. All right again before you proceed you need not focus on what you did wrong. There is nothing wrong or right about it. Simply focus on why you would choose to project a reality that you cannot act upon right now. If that answer is immediately available green it, learn and proceed. If it is not simply again ground yourself to what is available have you done that? I think by focusing on what's around me you mean what's going on in the moment. Do not be rate yourself green what you can from it and then reground yourself to the moment by seeing what choices are immediately right and responsive. Okay well often to do that I have to keep reminding myself or consciously saying stay in the moment, stay in the moment and when I'm. At first. It seems that when I stop consciously thinking of that then I start to float off into the past of the future. So if I don't have to how can I focus on the moment without focusing on the moment rather than continually repeating in your head some version of be here now. What you can simply say in any of these situations is all right. Can I act upon this yes or no? No. What can I act upon period that is all it takes to reground yourself to the moment. It is that simple. What if it's just a meditation there's no action to be done that is an action in and of itself and again the inspiration that is derived from that particular again somewhat subdued form of action take that inspiration into moving action. Okay. What I do not invalidate any one of the choices if it is to take a walk down the street go right ahead. Okay. Keep your eyes open when you do. Okay. When things are happening in my life that I don't prefer but I sometimes that happens to me and I can't figure out the positive reason that I created it. Can you name an example? And by the way I simply suggest that whatever example you name I will have an answer for. Which means you do too. Well one I can think of as I was having trouble writing a letter for the past week about a job and I for whatever reason I was having difficulty wording the letter the way I felt comfortable with. So in that moment it did not excite you to continue to do that correct. To continue to write the letter. Well I wanted to write the letter but I was. But it did not excite you in the moment. The end product of getting the letter written excited you but the writing of the letter in that moment did not is that correct. No but I wanted it to. It didn't know. Oh this is what we are speaking of engaging each and every moment according to your excitement. Now sometimes individuals will place the assumption well if I do not write this letter now it will simply never get written. Oh dear. That is not true. It doesn't excite you right now because something else is more representative of who you are and you need not bring along with that an assumption that there will not be in a timely manner a set of choices where writing the letter is the most exciting thing then you will simply not be able to end the letter. It will be that flowing and ongoing. Do you understand the distinction. This is the fine tuning degree to which we are now at with you and many individuals in just how much to trust your excitement in any given moment. If something excites you but what needs to be done in that moment is not exciting there are other ways to obtain it that are exciting. Simply they may seem unrelated but they will lead you to that idea. Well it leads to another issue around my job. I am looking for a job now and feeling financially that I have to find something within the next few months so I was feeling under a lot of pressure to. The job representative of who you truly feel you are and are you excited by it. I believe it is it's helping to reform education in this country. Oh then the writing of the letter will be in perfect timing but if in a particular moment that is not what excites you use the aforementioned criteria. Can I act on this now? Obviously not. I do not feel like writing this. What can I do right now? The thought I had was that if I did that and you know I had a sandwich or what I had a sandwich or whatever it was that I wanted to do instead of writing the letter was that I would be able to enjoy anything else because I would be thinking about my not writing the letter. Well this is up to you but again there is an inherent trust here that you will then never write it and if it is your desire and excitement to write it we are suggesting it is a given that it will get written. Allow yourself to be overwhelmed by the joy, surprise and discovery of when you will write it most perfectly. Okay and I was going to ask you for some suggestions on how to move forward with my job search. Would that that's one of them I guess? Well again to remain grounded in the moment but by choosing from what does excite you in the moment other opportunities will present themselves that are simply not available now so you will have more choices than you even are imagining that you will have but it requires in that sense taking these steps consistently down to the writing of the letter exciting you do it doesn't excite you don't do it trust that it will get done because it excites you it's a representation of who you are and trust that where your excitement then leads you will give you all the resources and knowledge you need to write the letter. Perhaps you simply do not have the knowledge to write the letter so then by following your excitement and eating that sandwich in a particular way a flash will come to you oh I will include that in my letter how exciting I would have never thought about this is how it works or how it can work if you allow it. Okay the thought does this all make sense so that it at least is in there. Yes it makes sense the thing that I was thinking of is I was wondering a lot of times when I don't want to do my job search stuff I think it's because I'm feeling afraid that I will fail somehow or something or the why do you believe it. Do you first of all understand what we initiated this interaction with the idea that when you have an idea of who it is you wish to be you are now that person. Now that you understand this on some level play around with that. Okay. You need not put pressure on yourself if you are pursuing or in a sense following your excitement then one thing will simply lead to another if you are creating reasons and upset of why things are not working that is what you will experience. Does this all at least make sense intellectually. Yes. Also understand sometimes there is the saying well I intellectually understand it but I don't feel it when you intellectually understand it you are it and if you will simply sit down with your imagination and project that belief you will feel it. Allow yourself to do so. Okay. Okay. Well I'll work with that. Wait with it. Okay. Let me ask you when I speak with you in meditation do I interrupt you or can you talk to me. Never. Never we can in that sense accommodate many individuals at once. Or there is a difference in our perception of time than yours. There is never as we have shared with your reality we only share these things that pertain to your reality because they already exist in our reality even the concept of an interruption it simply does not exist. Everything is part of the past by definition. Okay. And thank you for your ongoing communication. Oh yeah I'm sure. Thank you. And ask this timing. Allow us to pause for a short break of 15 to 20 of your earth minute and resume the new act at that time.
