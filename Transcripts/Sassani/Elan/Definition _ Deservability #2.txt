 Alright, I'll say continue sharing. Hey. Morning, I'm going to have an intensive a month ago. I woke up and when I opened my eyes in front of my face, floating in front of the bed, we're two long sticks. One of the sticks on the left had a very strange cap on it. It was a spiraling pattern of equal diameter. The cap was maybe about five inches high. And it got my attention. The impression I got was that they were two staffs. And I had a very strong feeling of some Egyptian influence on the cap on the staff on the left. More than a little baffled, I was wondering if you could offer anything to say. Well, to some degree you have offered it all. They will in that sense represent, perhaps you can say, staffs in and of themselves quite the neutral symbol, throughout your history, many individuals ascribe certain quote unquote powers to that. One would represent what you call Egyptian life. Another would represent what perhaps you will call wandering nomadic deserts life. Why were there two and why was the one on the left with this ornamental top to it, and maybe one on the right without? Along this recognition that we find to be apparent is that one will very strongly represent a very limited mundane, so to speak, presentation of life whereby you demonstrated none of your personal power. The other in that sense will represent exploration and awakening from within. So they are both my staffs and I get to choose which one I cake with. Perhaps you will understand that both will now serve you however only in a symbolic sense. One in that sense, two represent your connection to your spiritual self. The other again as other symbols that you have very creatively in that way created symbolizing the grout. What was the significance of that cap on the one on the left? Was there a specific message in that that was the Egyptian related or? Very specific however, perhaps it will be who you to avail yourself of your literature, for you will find it to be shall I say out there and then find it to be familiar when you find it. Then many of the questions that you are asking will simply become apparent. Well homework, good. Homefart. In terms of deserved ability, I'm going off to try next session at the end of July. I'm going off to explore the four corners of the Southwest to try and see if I can develop a lifestyle, which of course most of my friends tell me isn't possible and I'm out of my mind. Oh well then you will go and try to do so. Which of course makes it very exciting. Oh no you need not to cry. That is from their perspective that it is something unattainable. You may simply do for it is who you are. And the reason, yeah I'm not the nomadic nature of what I'm considering makes me wonder if the staffs aren't in somewhere related. The idea is to not lose your connection on either end. Being grounded at the cost of the spiritual orientation has one effect. Being spiritual without grounding it has another effect. What will allow you to live most effortlessly and efficiently is understanding that spirituality and physicality are simply the same thing. Physicality is a version of spirituality. You need not throw all the separation and can simply live spiritually through the choice of the physicality and need not have one at the cost of the other. I'm going to, what I wanted to do was to try and be able to have a base camp as it were out in the mountains of Southern Colorado or Northern Arizona, depending on what I find. And to be able to maintain my business here on the East Coast, which is primarily what everyone is telling me is not going to be able to take place. When you and I spoke three or four months ago you told me that I had a number of leaps of faith coming up. I expect this is probably just another one. Well, you need to look at it as such a tenuous and unobtainable thing requiring such a leap, but in a sense you may understand it to be a manifestation of that sentiment. Perhaps you can say, a malady in your languages simply go for it. I was reading some Alice Bailey material in which they talked about something that referred to as the law of substance, and I found it defined. Well, what they described it as is that the universe is unlimited in its bountifulness. It has the ability to give everything to everyone that they ever desired if they believe they deserve it. But one of the keys that they were pointing out was that to think of it as a vertical column of warehouses, unless you take from the warehouse and use it in integrity and in love, the doors above will not open for you. Well, that is an analogy, perhaps again, therefore bound to some of the limitations of it as an analogy, but we understand the sentiment. I was wondering if you could expound on that a little bit, because basically what they're saying is that, or the impression I got was that along the lines of the leap of faith that by reaching for something, the universe will give it to you, but if you do not reach for it, it will not be given to you on a silver platter. Perhaps the point is this, expressing trust, perhaps you can say, is a sentiment, but where it then comes back to your ability to respond is when through that trust you attract an opportunity or a situation that then requires your action. Therefore your willingness to be spontaneous, to remain open-minded and to act when you can, continuing to place your clear intention, continuing to imbue your clear intention, but not waiting in that sense as you sometimes, societally, say for that safe to fall upon your head, allowing the opportunities that come along that are unique to the persons, again, places and perhaps events or things occurring to be acted upon by you wherever possible. Therefore trust truly is not necessarily completely tacit and is an action in another self. And also understand what you call abundance is a flow, and that something in that sense makes itself known to you or makes itself available to you. It does so so that you can do something with it. That continues the flow. That in a sense leaves the doors open. But in that sense if you hoard or save up in that sense, you are stopping that form. Now we are not saying go out and spend all your savings, understand you have very rigid definitions around it, but you may in that sense as you begin to follow your excitement no longer feel the need for a backup. Again though the point is that the abundance is a flow which is ever in lifting and enrolling your action. Your willingness to so to speak rise to the occasion is all you need to do and will because it will present itself through exciting possibilities be quite effortless once you allow yourself to see that the mechanism actually works. So in other words by trusting and following my excitement by going out taking this trip and exploring the capabilities of leading a nomadic life between two or more cities in this country that because it is following my excitement that I share that understand and believe that if it is meant to be then the means will make themselves available. Well again also perhaps you may understand that the fact that it excites you is the sign that you have been asking for and also allows you to know you are amply able to fulfill it. Thank you. Oh I thank you. And again remind you that while doing so you may find you give yourself the choice to allow yourself to ascribe to your clear intention or allow particular things in your reality which is not possible. In your reality which may come up to talk you out of your intention. It will always be your choice and ability to continue to express the clear intention and not allow any seeming evidence to talk you out. I'm very stubborn. Persistent perhaps. Excuse me. Would be a bit more shall I say. Dynamic. Thank you. Oh. I thank you. Shut it. Hey. I wanted to ask you about I work for a program back in Rhode Island called Shake a Leg. I do find and it is a holistic program for spinal cord injured young men and women. Oh. And I do body work on them and I'm going to be taking them through a seminar and another week or so. And I want to get a little information about spinal cord injury and why from metaphysical perspective. Certain individuals would manifest that condition. What they can do with it or how they can use it in a positive way. I want to give them some insights into why they are in this position in the wheelchair. Well again understand the number the numerous amount of them. But again suggest that there are that many reasons that individuals would do so. But one opportunity will be that individuals will show themselves their great power because. Physically speaking your body completely has the ability to regenerate those facilities. And the only thing that shall I say results in individuals not doing so is the societal notion. One societal notion that perhaps is less prevalent but has been here to forth bought into very strongly. Is that what you call your brain tissue your nervous tissue could not regenerate as other areas of your body. This is plain and simply not accurate. It has that potential completely. What releases that potential is the trust and understanding that it has that ability. What seems to inhibit that potential is buying into a bill of goods. Well everyone knows you can't heal that. Every single individual who has this through persistence and clear intention has the potential ability to heal. The timing will vary often because of the degree to which individuals buy into it can in that sense seem to take much time. But nevertheless individuals who do not do so have simply accepted their sentence. Yes. Have some of them manifested this for specific reasons and purposes that they need? Some to overcome it. Some in that sense to in that sense express their creativity and their creatorhood even though. Even though that is considered by your society to be a handy cap. Many individuals are in that sense living proof that it is simply a different choice or focus. Right. It also seems to tie into what you said about disease and not feeling sorry for them. They seem to be very strong individuals especially in this program because they've done much more with their lives than the average person in a wheelchair. Well you will understand that they will very strongly represent again through that persistence those who should choose to the degree to which you all have the power to persist. And again that it takes great strength to create and experience limitation. Right. So is there anything else that I could do for them or to help them to understand or speak to them with that understanding? Speak to them with the complete confidence in their power and perhaps allow yourself to feel the admiration to the degree that they have expressed that time. That is something that perhaps they are not accustomed to. Yes. So therefore it would be taking it the next step so to speak. So is there any specific themes that go along with why you would choose in this lifetime to be spinal cord injury? There are again varying symbols that will apply. Some again will have to do with support, mobility versus being static. But again if there is a specific incident or a specific individual that will be more obvious. In general there are again a multiplicity of reason. The other thing I wanted to ask you is I just spent, I just got back from a trip to Australia. And I spent four or five days at Ayres Rock. And I wanted to ask you a little bit about the energies of the rock and the original energy that I experienced there. I know Beshav has talked about Ayres Rock as a power center in the previous sessions that I've heard. And I wanted to ask you a little bit about generally what is going on there at this point in time. And how it related to me when I was there as well. You do not have that much to add other than the fact that you will very strongly understand that this area is conducive toward what you would call the heart chakra or heart energy. So therefore it is an opportunity in so to speak bathing or aligning with that energy to allow many things to come to the surface through generally what you would call emotionality. And therefore it is a sense, a method of catharsis. Did you experience a little bit of that? Yeah. But also some, seem like some ancient memories of aboriginal culture. But that will also strongly relate to what you may refer to as dream time. Yes, exactly. The time when there was less of a distinction between what you call nighttime sleeping dream and your life dream. So we thank you. Yes, it was very nice. Thank you. Shut it. What? Oh, yes. We may help. Hey. Greetings, but did not mean you. Ah! Oh! Hey, now. My name is Dora. I'm a teacher. My question is about abundance and responsibility and how I'm experiencing it. And I would like to share something with you that happened a couple of days. Oh! Doing proceeds? I need to create abundance for myself. But to give myself opportunity to do the work that I want to do. Oh! First of all, before you proceed, you need not create something you do not already have. Step one is realization that abundance flows through you. And you can, again, perhaps recognize what you already have as an expression of the abundance you already contain. Therefore, you then need less effort to build up something which you are claiming you do not have. So begin to, in that sense, revel in how you have and note how you have already expressed your abundance. Right. In many, many, small ways and some good things, I know I have, I'm not a public member. Oh! So how do you wish to now continue to create that abundance? Life distinction? Oh! I think I want to stretch you more. Then have that clear intention, move through your reality and keep your eyes open for the very opportunities that will physically seem to allow that. Also, loosen up on how you allow that abundance to come. Allow it to come in whatever form it is. If there is something you quote unquote need money for in order to then pay someone to provide a service, keep your eye out for individuals that may be simply willing to provide the service. Focus on the end result, not the way to get there. Set it up as a clear intention and then allow your reality to deliver in any way that it would, the path of least resistance. Which is not, by the way, in general, are you would obviously all be, shall I say, as you say, winners winning law. I'm not sure. Okay, I'm finished, my story. So I decided to, I don't know if this falls in the category of taking action, but I decided to buy a lot of tickets. Oh! Then I run the jumps again. So, I'm in the store and I was trying to write my numbers and pick my numbers. This homeless person I know walked in and he asked the lady, would she take his food stamps to buy some juice from it or whatever. And his question made me think, now he deserves money more than I do and I didn't. Now now. Look at the definition behind that statement. But understand that you all equally deserve, take nothing away from yourself in honoring the deserve-a-vivvy of someone else. Do you proceed? That's what I'm trying to feel. Well, what did you do? I didn't buy the ticket. I didn't feel like doing it. I didn't seem to be like to get it. At that moment. So what about, I mean, if I stop to think about all the other people, then what's this? Okay. I said I have. Oh, I know I deserve it, but also other people. Well, again, when you change yourself, then your reality will seem to change. The idea being that the change will initiate with yourself, and then that will change what you see, what you attract, what you perceive. If there are individuals that come into your, shall I say, immediate proximity, and there is something within you that excites you with your integrity that you can do to assist them, by all means do. But that is truly all that you can do. And in assisting them being responsible to them, it will still be up to them how they are responsible for your assistance. So again, perhaps one way to say this is that if it is obvious, go for it. If it is not mind your own business. That is what will behoove you to pay attention to. This is how. Yes, I did think about the sign that he deserved to get that juice and he called it. There you go. And I was there to win one of your thousands of dollars and I couldn't. Well, apparently you were there to evaluate this individual and his circumstances and your own deservedly. Therefore you received a great gift that day. And I also wanted to share something as some other incident that happened. I was looking at Julie's door and made a lot of expensive Julie around and I opened the spaces for people and my children. And someone made off with something. So I was wondering what was, I mean I could read his mind. I knew what part they were going to respond to. But why did you not trust that? And why did you therefore perform actions inconsistent with what you say, you know. Now, the point is not to judge yourself for doing so. Simply know that you have provided in no uncertain terms evidence that your sentings are accurate and that you may wish in that way in the future to act according to them. That was easy. I got right there. But did I help him in some way that I mean to help him? Well, in a sense you may understand that you enabled him to perform an act out of his everything, but that is his responsibility. Ultimately, the realization that will come at some point in that person's development will have that to have been of assistance to that person. But again, your concern is how does it in that sense relate to you and what can you do if you see him again, then you interact with him. Thank you very much. Oh, thank you. Shut up! Oh, hey! That's not...... I made a particular matter interacting with us and that interaction, your civilization has been created. It suddenly occurred to me that there might be other civilizations that we're interacting with in the same way. Are we......interbreeding, so to speak, with the Pleiadians or any other civilizations? In the way that you mean not really, now there are isolated incidences, there are particular relationships, but in the way that you are asking the question, in my assessment, no. No, no other civilizations. That are co-intermingling with your own species genetically at this time, in your ancient past yet. Okay, so not sure about this. This is, perhaps you can say, the time of non-interference in many ways. Yeah, well that's what I wondered about, specifically I wondered about the Pleiadians because they're being so human-like, you know, that there would be that interaction to some degree at all. Well, this is why I have said that there are isolated incidences, but there is not a societal program in that way. Oh, okay, so there may be isolated incidences, but there wouldn't be interactions that would create another civilization or anything like that. No, and you will find that you have common roots to begin with. Yeah, that's why I thought it's the same natural that that might occur. From time to time. Thank you. Oh, fine juice? Is that all? Well, the latest drawing that I've found, I actually like to get your perspective on him. Well, first of all, what makes you think of him? Oh, because I thought it was. Perhaps in your understanding of that delineation that would not be accurate, and that being would be somewhat androgynous in that way. Oh, okay, well that makes sense because most of them wind up that I can't come up with this thing. I'm just going to say, I'm the most familiar. So I have the idea that he's very, that he's aquatic in that way. Aquatic in that way generally refers to specifically water, and that would not be, shall I say, the precise designation. But you may understand that civilization to exist within what you would call fluid environment. It would be the environment of the ones that you've been exploring with that you've been doing some investigation with? Very percent. I kind of thought so. Oh, I assume you believed it. Yeah. But the idea is, yes, we did discuss in terms of some of the acclimation process that prepared us to physically interact with that particular society, and that will do as a representation. Great. So the idea of the rest of the body, which is exciting to me because I haven't really gotten an idea of how a lot of bodies would look, is that actually I think I'm just drawn. What else is doing? I mean, we'll discuss this again. Yeah. Oh, thank you. You have done it all. And allowed your society to see things, perhaps you can say, ahead of the schedule of the mass consciousness. We're thanking. Shut it. Oh, yeah. Greetings. And we did it. In our, in the last interaction where we went through the meditation, in my meditation, I was in a place that was actually very beautiful that I had never been before. And it was very colorful. It was a look at the pictures on the wall, and I didn't see pictures. I saw colors and very bright and vivid colors. And when I went into the room, it was a circular room. And it was mentioned to me that this was your craft. Is that true? Well, in a sense, we'll understand that our energy was present, overlapping and was represented in the simple zooprocy. Okay. What has excited me, the vision that I held is working with D.Va. And when I was there, I was talking or feeling plant life and animals. And then just before I came back, there were three little, what I perceived, just three little people that came over. And my question is, who were they? In a sense, they will represent what you are speaking of and the initiation of that style of contact. Okay. What you would call a political consciousness. Oh. Thank you. Well, thank you. Also, I'd like to add, I believe that I've had three separate interactions with you in the last couple of weeks. Am I correct in believing that? Absolutely. Again, thank you. Well, do you wish to share one of them? Yeah. I'm not sure which one. Actually, the last one, which was when, I don't know, I'm not sure which one. Which was when I was going into meditation, I was expecting you and got somebody else. And who had an Irish accent? Well, in a sense. That is simply an interpretation, generally with the overtone of alien or foreignness. But you will understand we do not speak the language. However, the point, perhaps one of them being made is that if you are willing individually to tune into our society, perhaps you do not always know what you will get. There are many individuals in our society willing to communicate with you all. Oh, I see. So what you're saying is that someone else within your society that was communicating with me. Now, what was the message for your interpretation of it? Probably the message from our interpretation of it. That someone else is communicating with me? Well, I assume when you say communicated that something, some idea, some concept was trans... What is your perception of? Well, basically I was afraid of it. What then happened? Was it forced upon you? No. Or did it match your degree of hesitation? Yes. Allowing you to know that it is always up to you to go the next step or not. Yes. Thank you. Is that all? Oh, one other question. From pertaining to my father, he was a Black and a better word died three years ago. And what I'd like to know is he's still in a spiritual. Look at the reincarnated name and approximate age and time of death. He lost in Tauroi, he was going to be 55, time of death September. That will be. Good. How strong is perception? Is that he is in that sense soon to reincarnate? That is all we have received. Thank you very much. I'd like to follow up with what now I'm talking about the Canadian. When I was in Bali at the Channel in Wisconsin, one of the channels who was there was Barbara Larson-Yak, the Channel in the Indian Energy. Oh. I didn't really get good feelings from what she was talking about. And in the first, you know, her introductory challenge, they're showing me really began telling people about how they should experience and look for the dark side and the black magic that was present in Bali. And now do understand there is a positive interpretation of that. The dark side again, simply representing those things you are unwilling to look at, that you are unwilling to shed your light upon, and therefore the dark side, simply representing those things you still deny, that when you acknowledge you can then transform. So that area in a sense is conducive for the flushing to the surface of much of these ideas, giving you the opportunity to accelerate very quickly. Now, pay attention to that interpretation. Pay attention to a tendency to perhaps have a negative interpretation. Understand that from what it said, you will always assign your own interpretation, therefore communications of this sort are truly more than one time removed. But do proceed. There were a number of people there at the content who were more or less followers of her, the information that she channeled, and were almost obsessed with material that she channels about the creative things they're like in appearance. And I know that you've always said that they're very much more humanoid. We are not actually aware of any particular race that would fit the quote unquote, loser description. Where does all that come from? From your ancient history to a large degree. And where you call the symbol of the snake, perhaps you can say later the symbol of the dragon, which is actually historically the symbol of wisdom. But when wisdom, perhaps you can say it became an impediment to certain individuals wishing to control that the lack of wisdom, or shall I say denial of one's power enabled those wishing to control to maintain control, there was shall I say a negative interpretation assigned to what you call symbol of surface and to some degree symbol of dragon as well. That is from our understanding, the closest source that we can't invest in. Well, is there what you call, we aliens are quite human like and would be indistinguishable from any other human sitting in this room too. Where is this stuff coming from? Is it filtering on the part of the channel or so? We do understand again that always, only can it communication be made through the existing definitions of any given channel and then only is it heard through the existing definitions of the participants. So therefore, there may be slight coloration according to the background of any individual, particularly if their background is seeking what you call negative religiousism and what you call negative predictionism if there is such a word. Yes, what's that right now? I have an idea that individual may very well have a sincere intention, but only can any individual ever express from the viewpoint they are choosing to express whether they choose that consciously or unconsciously. You will generally find that communications from that stream that you would call creative. People who are being filtered, that is not their understanding. They very much live expressing their power consciously and wish to allow the granting of your own sovereignty and your own right to do that as well. Therefore, their advice would not generally be, boy, are you in trouble, you better do this, this and that would be quite similar to our own presentation, though there are some differences. For presentation really was not an accurate question. Do you understand, however, that you were listening through the ears of your own definition and you will find if you wish to be most accurate, even according to your own definitions, that there is some information which is applicable and very strongly useful, some which is not. And as we had suggested, if you simply take what applies to you and release what does not for someone else, you can still gain and then actually wind up cutting through the filtration and getting the real communication. If you assume if one thing that is said is incorrect, I will invalidate it all, you lose your own access. I have another question about things that went on during the conference in January afterwards. Several people went to healers during that time and a couple of healers were western, either American or other western culture, and then a couple of the healers were called balayons, which are the native healers in Bali. The first thing is to balayons, which is a series of mostly acupressure types of manipulation. Second week, several people want to see an older, more experienced, more experienced, like the most native healer. And he did, I guess, some kind of, I guess you might call it psychic surgery where he collected like energies into one part of their body and then seemed to actually extract something from their body. We'll understand that that is a co-creation and that the individuals participating are willing to empower that symbol and therefore allow, shall I say, the performance of a quote unquote process, which would enable them to perhaps you can say focus their power in one place. Well, a lot of these people for the next several days were in some varying degrees of physical pain. Some people were actually had marks on their bodies and were oozing blood for a day or more, and one of them got quite sick after seeing the healers. Well, apparently, their particular interpretations of the effect were in that way negative. They created that effect. No one did anything to them. That was how they chose to match, allowing them, by the way, to see certain things about where they're at, if they are willing to embrace the symbols rather than denying them. Well, my question about that is, is there when there's such a cultural difference between a person who's going to see the healer and the culture in which the healer lives and practices? It will be completely up to the individual. There is not, because of the ilk of each society, inherently, therefore going to be that result. That result was a result of the individuals involved. Other individuals have accessed that particular form of atmosphere, of self-healing and heal themselves. Generally, then again, ascribing the credit to the healer. I wasn't really sure, but it also seems to me that several of the people who went to the healers were looking for someone else to heal them. And again, perhaps in this instance to some degree, did not allow the external symbol to be, quote unquote, successful to bring it back to their own personal self. Real basketball. Well, it was like, shut it. It's even hard. Before you said thank you to me, and my first response to that would be to say thank you to you. But now my second response to that is, you're welcome. You're welcome, Ms. Mens. I have several questions. One is you said that the servants, I thought that the Aniyonaki were servants? No. White human like, if you wish to ascribe that label. What you were generally called bearded in appearance. The males. I did not want you to think your circus bearded lady was an alien. I am now experimenting with channeling. I know that there are a lot of guys here in this room tonight. It seems like it's more than usual. Is there something different? Well, that will completely and arbitrarily depend on what you are calling usual in a very unusual situation. I've never seen this many before. Well, again, always are there many individuals tuned in on my end, but understand what you are in general perceiving is what you would call your own earthly oriented guide. Yes. But understanding that each individual has such access is truly that unusual that there would be so many. Now, not that everyone dialogues with them or even desires that type of assistance. But all the guy does anyway is to lure you into more of yourself in a very non-abtrusive way. So when all is said and done, you can still say you did it all. Okay, that's your own personal guide. So perhaps that will apply to anything you are calling guide. Never can a guy do anything for you. Never. What about when you channel that guy? Then you are channeling a guide who will perhaps give information. If you do that thing, perhaps you will get that result. If you do not, you will not. So it is you doing the doing, not the trying, the doing and getting the result, perhaps again allowing a little bit of nudging very unobtrusively from anything you are calling a guide. Understand you can perhaps even define your own higher self since you generally draw a distinction and do not see yourself as the higher self, but a portion of a larger higher self. Understand your primary guide is your own self. And perhaps you may understand that any guide who will communicate to you in any way seemingly as a separate identity will come through your higher self. So you are never separated or completely removed from the entire process, hence always completely response able. Is that all? Can I choose the higher guide that I want? Anything that is presented to you is simply one choice, but ultimately you choose, you act, you get the effect. Again, you contain it all, everything. So you get to from that multiplicity, pluck and choose the things that are representative of who you choose to be thereby having a sense of creating your particular reason. Thank you. And you. And you're welcome. Shutting. Could you also say that believing is feeling? Well, yes. But ultimately we're going to keep tracing down the line. It will appear in some way in your reality. So believing is feeling, believing is thinking, believing is doing. Your actions are the expression of a doing. I really hope someday to see one of your spacecraft or whatever, but I think... Well, understand, as we have discussed, that hope generally implies a deal of doubt. Sometimes this fair, it would not require a miracle to do so. You need no ray of hope. Have that intention and trust the timing, or we would not appear any sooner to you physically than would behoove us both. That timing is crucial and will only unfold in perfect accord. Well, I really look forward to that. And I want to ask you a question about a dream that I had. A lot of people that have come to these sessions talk about out-of-body experiences. And the other night when I was dreaming, it was like I was flying over the city and everything was black around me, but I could see the lights below. And I remembered what you said about being in a protective bubble at one of the interactions that we had. Well, perhaps not protective. Well, it felt like I was in one of those little pipes that you blow on the end, and this beautiful fluid bubble all around me. But just as I was beginning to let go and enjoy this, it was a great big black bird with a long beak who was just... I didn't really do Christmas bubble. I wondered what that was, symbol of my own fear. Well, to some degree, yes. And again, assuming the necessity of that protection, were you to allow yourself to feel that fear in the form of allowing, perhaps you can say that bird to pop that bubble, you would have found you would have continued to have the same ability. And the bubble was an assumption of a necessity for protecting. But I remind you, when you do so, in a sense you are preparing for the worst, though you may be saying you expect the better. Now, last night in a dream, it was my head, it was myself, but on the reverse side of my head on the back, there was another face. Instead of hair being there, there was a smaller face, like a child's face. Is that the child was trying to come out and be recognized? It was the child that in that moment you were expressing to be doing such a thing that you had not allowed yourself to experience, you physically were a child, where you had these experiences and dreams quite often as a child. And you may understand when you have what you call a flying dream, in no uncertain terms you are out of your body, while you are doing that. In the definition that you mean, again, I remind you, you are not technically within the body to begin with. But from the transparency of the shift of your point of view, it would appear that you are out of the body. All right, the faces that I see floating inside of me, inside in front of my face, when I wake up that aren't Zeta looking with the black eyes, but are real people with might those be the Pleiadians that you were just talking about who look like us? For a specific reason right now, I will not comment. Oh, good. So, continue. Because it feels like I should know him, and they are trying to tell me something, and I keep saying in my head, are you the people that I'm supposed to be talking to? Oh, but understand, they are not trying, they are doing it, simply when you are ready, listen, and you will be told directly. Oh, thank you. Do you have anything to say about the number 55, which I just turned and I was afraid I was never going to make and live through? Hey! Happy birthday. Bye! You said double numbered, quite often, are transformational times in our lives, and I just... You may understand in many ways your life is just beginning. Therefore, allow yourself to express that discovery, that joy, that fascination that is represented by the face of the child. Oh, thank you. Very much. Oh, thank you. You have done it all. Allow that sense of the child to factor into your awareness when in that sense forgiving yourself, or you will find the child within you far more willing to forgive yourself in that way. So use that sentiment to your advantage. Oh, why? Thank you very much. Oh, thank you. There will be but a few more sharings. Shut up! Come on. May I... Then please. If I hadn't been... I had a dream the other day. I've been having a lot of dreams, and the other day I had one that was curious. In the context of the dream, and I don't really remember the context of the dream, but I felt something in my nose. And I reached up and I could almost feel it, but I couldn't quite get to it. So I... it took some... some effort. Now, you are not simply using this as an elaborate excuse to pick your nose. I'm not answering. Perhaps you were just scratching. Well, I might have got a hold of something. Oh! And pulled it out, and it was... it was about an inch and a half, and it was about a one-inch thick, and it had like a root on it. It was about a whole another inch. Oh, hello. When I looked at it, I said, what? The significance of this? Because I don't have any... I don't have any thoughts of being a detaining, or maybe playing us up my nose. And this... this happening was out of context with the rest of the dream. And I felt, what is the significance of this? And what did you derive? That's my sense, my man. Well, it is rare that this occurs, but I am as fascinated as you are. But the idea, perhaps, is in willing to dig that deep. You will always find some deep. And sometimes the meaning will be apparent. But if it is not, I think it will be the assumption that it will become apparent. Moving on in your business will then allow it in its timing to become apparent. Now, this is doubly reinforced by the fact that I get no interpretation, which is quite rare. Many times I get one and will not share it. But if I am not receiving it, then obviously your timing comes into play. Thank you very much, Alan. Oh, thank you for being so picky. Thank you for being so generous. We thank you for understanding the you. Shurrying, be me. Thank you, Alan. And you. To go back to the... I'd like to check a detail of the details that I was asking earlier. When I saw myself in the flower draft, the first draft I saw was casual and the second was the suit. And I interpreted that because I had been asking about my work and everything that symbolized me and I should be so-called more buttoned up and more business-like about it. Is that a good correct or... What it correctly identifies is that this is obviously an issue within you. But you may understand that you get to choose. And that business-like, shall I say, presentation is truly more of an attitude and is perceived from your attitude than what you call physical appearance. So decide why you find that to be, quote unquote, more acceptable. If your definitions in that sense bear that out, perhaps that is how you are telling yourself to be. But you may simply find that that is not necessarily how it excites you to express that particular style of, perhaps you can say authority. And perhaps you can say organization. That's... I think for most of my life I felt that I caught me about the kind of like the rules or how things are done in society and how I more feel like doing things. And it's been a constant resistance. I felt for most of my life a lot of attention about that. Well, again, no one else's judgment has resulted in that tension. You're buying into and matching that. So understanding this, embrace that you have done so, then you can change. That's terrific. And who you are inside is always what will be seen. Certainly. No. Okay. I'd like to share a quick, actually two really quick things. When we were talking about my mother and things here, and I just like to tell you that my mother's 71 and she's in love and she's talking about getting married. Oh, how are you? It's nice to get to know her as a human being and as a feeling and caring person. She's one of the really nice things in my life right now. Thank you for sharing. And what? Also the name I got some months ago was Shota, S-O-T-A. I think that's my name and also I think it's a NASA-SONI recognition. And so I thought maybe that was me at the time. Well, understanding that we have no names and that that will simply be more relevant to something in your Earth sphere that will do. Okay. Thank you. Oh, thank you. Shota. Alon. Hey. I had a quick... A very general question about... How do you go about presenting yourself very confidently and knowing that you're very good at what you do without it really going to your ego or having people believe that you're coming from ego or arrogant in some way? The idea is that the issue is within you, not there. If you know that you are simply being who you are, no matter what they say, it will have no effect. If it does, it is your opportunity to see where you feel to some degree that you are still operating from what you call ego. But again, I remind you, ego is simply as you create yourself in portions, at least to this point, the portion of yourself that you create and it's primary, perhaps you can say only real function, is to keep you focused in physical reality. So with that definition, it need not enter into you expressing your abilities and talents with confidence. Well, I've overheard people specifically in New Age orientations where they were afraid to really express who they were fully because of them believing they were either coming from ego or other people believing that they would... Well, in general, it is a fear of the very belief they say they wish to express as well. So again, we are speaking definitions, we are speaking a variety of them depending upon the specifics. Okay. We thank you. Hello. This is kind of vague, but I'm sure... I could choose fear a lot at this point in my life, and instead of fear, I'm allowing the fear... By the way, when you do not choose the fear, do you deny it while you do? If so, this is why it seems to keep coming back as an option to choose, but simply when it comes along feeling it, I emphasize again, feeling the fear, then it delivers a message. Choosing something else in denial of the fear still reinforces the fear through the attention placed upon it through the denial. So when it comes up, trust the timing, now is the time to fear. Oh, joy. I will fear as much as I can. You will see again very quickly, it cannot overcome you, and it delivers with it the definitions that have resulted in that feeling. Okay, I guess I feel it to a certain point, and then I... Squealed to the fear in that sense, integrating and acknowledging. I would tell you, I thought I was allowing it, but maybe I'm stopping it. Well, have you ever sat down and worked yourself up into abject error? Oh, of course. Then you are doing just... Oh, good. But other than the point is not to simply do that and leave it at that, but to then ask yourself, what are my definitions? What are my beliefs? What must I obviously believe to feel this way, and while you are feeling that way, it will be obvious? Well, I know that I've come to the realization that I believe I'm capable of taking care of myself. I mean, that's a big one. Well, that is a power dance for. You are already taking care of yourself. Right. So we've knowledge where you already do. Use that as evidence and then continue to do so purposely. And along with it is this great feeling I have of magic, of the magic of my existence, and that there's something, believe it now, something so incredibly... Understand. About my life, and then I feel great. Well, you have in the table before you, both choices. Okay, so I guess... I guess it's like there's something that's intangible. I choose... Oh, alright. Perhaps it boils down to this. Choose the magic. Acknowledge the fear. Do not choose the magic in denial of the fear. That is the slight, shall I say, discriminating factor that will make the difference. Choose the magic and the fear. Acknowledge the fear. Now, we could get more technical, more definitive about magic, more concrete. Is there anything you can help me with to make the stealing, or the sensation of the magic around the fear? Well, very simply the statement. And that though your society does not always express it, it is quite obvious to us. And will be obvious to you when you entertain the notion that miracles are quite the rule and not the exception. Most often your society will assume it to be the exception. So begin to expect a miracle. Not hope for one. Exactly. Almost. Thank you. At this timing, allow me to share something with you, that is, perhaps you can say, synchronicity on the one hand, somewhat humorous on the other, and demonstrates that individuals in your society have the ability to channel our stream no matter who they are. There is a word in our ancient language. It translates to mean roughly in your language. Now it means more than this, but it will translate roughly in your language. To mean the sharing of essences. It translates phonetically into your language as the word. Shuka. SHUKE. SHUKE. Say simply look it up in your article. Therefore you will understand that individuals need not acknowledge our existence, and still can they have direct access to our stream. Therefore so do all of you. I thank you for your willingness to share your definition and deservability with us and with me. It is my love and joy through which I function as an ambassador to your civilization. I am no less than that, and each and every one of you are no less than an ambassador for your own civilization as well. It is my honor to interact with you in this way. I continually revel in opportunities to do so. I bid you a most fond and bluffing. Good evening.
