 Alright, I'll say, before we continue, allow me to entitle this interaction. Instant change. And if you wish, the parenthetical title is the title of your choice. Shift happens. Very cute. Shitting. Do not. Oh, speak at once. There are many, many races on the planet that are all integrating together. Could you comment upon the richness that this will be for all of us on this planet, the richness that we'll create for our race? The idea from our perspective is that there truly is the opportunity to have what we call or what you also refer to as unity in diversity. And the idea is that though you do perceive that you are having the intermixing, the interblending, there is still what you call the maintenance of the separate races as well. So literally, as you have said, you are literally beginning to increase the amount and style of different types of expression upon your planet. As you personally express and expand the expression of your own consciousness, consciously, you will also see outer reflections of this as well. And so are you to understand the strength, the potential strength that exists in diversity, in having many different representations, many different representational approaches? You will begin to understand this to be one of your greatest strengths as a society. Does that answer your question? Yes. And when this diversity combines, could you comment on how this diversity, when it combines with our duality system, how that will also increase, help us with our strength and richness also? Well, what you refer to as duality is not so much a statement as an assumption, as an approach. And the idea is there are many different ways in that sense to express. The idea you are referring to as duality. You can in that sense understand positive negatives, perhaps in this case and more, as opposed to this particular discussion, is the idea of masculine and feminine, masculine and feminine polarity in that sense is something that you are beginning to both individually and collectively begin to integrate within you, understanding that although you will express yourself as a certain gender, truly energetically, you contain both ideas. One of the ways very simply to describe these ideas is that your feminine side, your feminine energy will represent your willingness and ability to proceed, to take in, to receive and what you perhaps will refer to as your masculine aspect or energy can be in that sense your willingness to put out, to act, to assert. As you begin to balance these ideas, then you also create a homogenous approach to your reality. So as you begin in that sense to allow what you have here to for, refer to as differences, simply be reinforcements of different strengths and aspects and at the same time being willing to fully integrate and use both your energies, be fully receptive and fully willing to act and put out, this type of balance is representative, if you will, of a very conducive, direct and strong approach to consciousness and to expansion. And so that idea of integrating the polarity can express itself in many ways. The integration of the male and female energy being one idea. Is that what you meant? That was part of it, but you expressed it pretty well. I also meant the duality of so-called, I guess you mentioned it, positive and negative, which I guess would also be male and female in a way. In that sense, it can be understood in that way. One other idea that has been expressed as duality in your society, which to us is not truly a duality, is the idea of spiritual and material. Following the separation between spiritual and material creates the aparency, and perhaps you might word it as the consequence of that type of duality, of that type of artificial separation. But from our perspective, because consciousness is primary and everything else is an expression of consciousness, material, materialness, materiality is an expression of spirituality. And so the only thing that would remove that aparency is the assumption that they are separate things. When you assume that material and spiritual are separate, one of the conclusions that is drawn is that you must negate the material in order to express the spiritual. This in a sense is not a holistic approach, for it does not take into consideration that the material is a spiritual expression. And that if you in that sense attempt to deny any portion of yourself, you are truly invalidating your whole self. So being willing to understand that material, material, materiality is a spiritual expression removes the connotation of duality, of polarity from that idea, and allows you to express yourself materially using the materials and the advantages that come along with this reality, but not at the cost of spirituality, rather as a function of spirituality. Do you understand the distinction? Yes, there's a function of spirituality and materiality on our third dimensional playing, correct? That is the way that you will experience it. But as you begin to express yourself in more of fourth dimension or density, terms you begin to understand your limitless potential. You begin to understand yourself as the creator and you no longer draw the lines of distinction. Material is automatically understood to be a serendipitous, automatic and effortless spiritual expression. One more question. Oh, thank you. Would you like to ask another? Yes, I enjoyed that. Thank you. Thank you. Now I enjoyed you enjoying it. If our race evolves here, will our physical planet also be evolving? Sometimes I try to separate our race as evolving on our planet. Will the actual planet Earth be evolving with our race? Absolutely. Okay. Add an expression of your race and the other way around. For from the perspective of your planet, if you can in that sense for a moment, but imagine the idea that your planet has a perspective because it is a consciousness, you as beings are not a parasite or blight upon it. You are an expression of it from its perspective. From your perspective, the planet exists within you as an expression of you as well. So there is an automatic link. There is an automatic connection that generally has the result of seeming in that sense to expand rather than evolve. Perhaps we can use the term expand in tandem. So as you begin to learn more about yourself, express more of yourself, you will also see more of the planet expressing itself in new and different ways in expanded ways using methods and what you call ideas that you have not here to force in different types of patterns of energy, different types of patterns of what you call weather, different types of these ideas as you all expand together. Again, from your perspective, you want to arm your planet. Literally, your planet, your body, your solar system, your universe, the multiverse exists within you and not the other way around. And though you are living the apparent being within the reality, merely beginning to entertain this idea can shift your perspective, instant change, you to begin to see how this is true as well. Are you eating? Or merely digesting what I am saying. Drinking the information. Thank you. May it be a soothing beverage. Is that all? Maybe just one more question. Oh, why? If I were to say you have one more. Okay, one more. Or one more. If I were to dig a hole, I was thinking and digging a hole down about five feet into my backyard and meditating, getting in the hole and meditating and... Now there are other ways to ground yourself, but that is a creative expression as well. But trying to become one with the earth, be grounding myself to the earth as well as trying to download higher spirit, higher. Maybe that's the... Understand that that exists within you as well. And maybe a higher vibration in that it is more expanded than the way you currently think, but it is not higher in better or something to aspire to that you are not already. By all means, if your imagination supplies such a creative way to in that sense, celebrate your connection, your grounded connection with your reality, by all means use it and you will find benefit from it. But you understand it more pragmatic and more obvious in more what you call day to day terms, simply your willingness to act and do things according with the decision that you make about yourself is grounding. Grounding is the idea of taking something from a mental concept and putting it into action, putting it into movement in your reality. So you can ground by simply doing anything with full commitment as to who you are as well. Although you have created this symbol and you will in that sense are you to do so? Find a result that will also be quite pleasing and what you perhaps will call calming. And that you will give yourself the opportunity to feel the seven and a half cycle per second wavelength vibration of your planet itself. And interestingly enough, you did not choose to go down that extra foot. Six feet under, which perhaps will occur another day. Is that all? Yes, thank you again. Oh, thank you for digging a beetle into more of yourself. Oh, thank you. Shutting. Hey, several nights ago, the channel and I together viewed the new movie Independence Day and therefore you probably are aware of it through him. Is that right? Fascinating. I understand what you are saying, Prosy. Would you share with us your reaction to that movie? That's their story. Very fascinating. Very creative, very exciting. Though from my perspective, not very likely. My perception is that it is based on what you call fun. Not so much fear though. Fear is a vehicle through which what you call the fun was expressed in that sense. In other words, it is my perception that it was meant in a lighter way. In that sense. It was my view that the destructive power that was displayed by the aliens, which was quite horrific really, what they displayed was not nearly as strong as what we have already achieved in our nuclear warhead space. But this was by design as the entire idea behind the destruction was to allow a habitable space to remain. And your particular weaponry in that sense are not geared toward doing so. But in the sense they take the captain down with the ship. But in having the thought I had, I felt good knowing that apparently our mass consciousness has decided years ago not to eliminate our planet with our nuclear warhead. By that means. That is our perception to this day. I wanted you to reaffirm that I guess. Thank you. Aww. Getting nervous. One more question. Aww, refer my empowerment. You are empowerment. Go about for this. I'd like to hear what's, every what's well. Oh my, but understand that it is a fact for you not because I say so, but because you in agreeing say so yourself. There is where your power lies. Everything I have to say is merely always offer as an option. Completely valid with all other options with no investment on my part whatsoever that you should do what I am saying. My job, my responsibility to myself is to merely share what it is I have to say. And that is where my involvement ends in any way that you choose to refuse or embrace it. That is up to you. My job is through. Free spirit. May I have my? You all are. Are you surprised that our media is so silent for whatever reason about all the craft circles that are going on? Not particularly. There are certain individuals who would prefer it that way. And they have the power to influence the media? To some degree not to the degree that they believe. But there are as you say in your vernacular other pressing matters to report on at this time. Understand that the source of that phenomenon is by no means universally agreed upon. And the number of them that are actually what you refer to as hoaxes are significant. So are the S.A. Son is still making triangular shapes? That would be our general approach though we have not done so in quite some time. It is not generally our thing. So we have participated in several of them. Also the normal shape of your spacecraft. We have different types of craft. That is the typical shape of what you call our scout craft. Thanks again. Oh, I thank you as well. Shut it. Hey, see you now. Recently it commenced my awareness of many people who are having difficulty breathing. They are being put on oxygen and even with this A they are still having difficulty. Is this anything to do with the change in the energy, the change in our density here? I mean I do not believe in such a thing as a coincidence. I would like your perspective on this. What in that sense most strongly does the symbol mean to you and in what way does it in that sense seem to affect you directly? In other words, were you to have 10 people with what you call shortness of breath? You would have 10 distinct reasons for the creation of that symbol. There may be some commonality. There may be overall common ideas. But generally speaking there will be 10 distinct and different reasons for expressing that. Therefore since the common shall I say factor is you, my simple question to you to allow yourself to engage in the same process when perhaps you are not interacting with me is what is the significance of it to you very obviously on the surface? What was your thinking when you noticed the quote unquote pattern that you are witnessing? Most of these people are quite advanced in age and I think most of them are making me believe at this time which I am not making. Understand you can be aware of the choices of others without making that same decision yourself but how does that allow you to feel? Well I feel that they are making this choice and it is their choice to make. I also feel that this has brought into my awareness the fact that actually breathing and how we breathe and I have been taking breathing classes. Oh what does it allow you to begin to revel in breath? Revel in the idea of what you call respiration which is the idea of an exchange with your environment. Very many ways an extension of what we had previously discussed. It is an expression of utilizing both in that sense as you define them of your energies. For instance what you call the inspiration would be as you say the female energy while expiration would be the male energy. The mere act of breathing is the act of exchange and balance in and of itself. And so when you become aware of others in that sense having such difficulty and that allows you to hone in on being more conscious of your breath you can do many things as you have been taking these classes and so forth with that recognition. Understanding that breath is equilibrium. Equal exchange. Is there something else that occurs to you? No I think that covers you. Oh right. In that sense the individuals that you become aware of who are having these difficulties are you able to dialogue with them? Not directly I'm not in direct contact words of misinformation comes to me in second hand. If you should find that you are by all means share and take that opportunity to share what you have learned about breath for as you say it is never too late. And you can be now that you have allowed these individuals to be of assistance to you by bringing your attention to this idea you can now complete as you say the circle and be of service to them as well. Thank you. Are you enjoying what you call your breath lesson in that sense? Definitely. What have you derived as an inspiration from this undertaking? It just seems to open to much more of your consciousness. Would you perhaps be willing to entertain the idea that you can only breathe as deeply as you do because your consciousness has opened first. And now your breathing is a reflection of your newly expanded consciousness rather than the other way around. When you begin to look at this you will see that you can actually experimentally feel what I am saying and understand when you find improvements to your body, mind or spirit in that sense always without exception where they proceeded by a shift in consciousness which then allows the expression of your body in this new way. Consciousness shifts first at least in a linear sense. In the infinite sense it is simultaneous but we will not go into that. All right. All right. Good evening. Hi. I have a question going back to our earlier discussion about victims. From a child's standpoint, younger, middle, a little bit older say under the teens but especially a little younger. From a physical, mental, sexual, abused situation type of thing or children that are born with diseases or manifest different types of diseases at a young age, in your perspective, speaking to us that this could be or is something that they reincarnated to in this lifetime. That would not be my particular approach to harp on merely to offer that up as information to in that sense if it were applicable to that situation allow the individual to understand the underlying mechanism. My particular approach in that given situation would be to address the idea that individuals, including these individuals, recreate themselves in every given moment as we had discussed at the beginning of this interaction. If they drag around the ball and chain or baggage of a concept that they had about themselves in the so-called path that may have been the result of a judgment about themselves, they build that into their decision constantly. So it is not that they walk around angry, frustrated and guilty, it is that they recreate that path moment to moment to moment and recreate anger, frustration and guilt. And so therefore my particular approach in discussing such an idea with such an individual who I assume if I am speaking with, to begin with, I attracted for the reason to offer something would be to allow them to entertain, not necessarily grasp strongly and fully but entertain the idea that they do recreate themselves each and every moment. That in any given moment they can forgive whatever degree they hold themselves at blame and allow themselves to move forward and see how something has been of service to them as well as see how it has impaired and hampered them or they continually will repeat and restate how it hamper them, how it holds them back and often not also see what they have gotten out of it, which again can often be the mindset, the frame of mind to assist other people as one example. And so the first thing in that instance is to realize that the individual need not hold blame to themselves. Their willingness to forgive themselves is step one and willingness to understand not that it is all right to perpetrate such an act but that they are all right even though they in a sense participated in a perpetrator victimhood situation. That allows them to take back responsibility without the assessment of blame. And that is a very strong distinction in allowing individuals to use their ability to respond, their responsibility rather than use as an excuse the blame. That it would be in the sense my general first step, does that make sense? Yes, because looking at it from a society standpoint whenever something negative happens to someone we automatically seem to position that person in the victim role even from a young person when this happens they may not even know that they may not know they can victimize but that they may not see themselves as a victim yet as a society we tend to set that. Really force that idea but to understand foundation when they do see themselves as the victim and when they are willing to make that shift you will even find your own tendency to interact with them will shift whereby you will no longer see them as victim. Their willingness to acknowledge their role without blame and learn from the idea and put what they learn into action can as you say provide a complete resolve and as that is occurring their outward appearance their outward demeanor changes and the way that other individuals reinforce or support certain notions changes as drastically. Thank you. So this is demonstrable once an individual chooses to change their point of view and this is not in any way shape or form to suggest to condone the perpetration but allow me again to draw the distinction between validating and condoning. Validating is the idea of saying alright that is not something I would do that is not something that I agree with but at least I can understand why someone might do that have the right and reason why it might be part of someone's exploration even though I do not agree with it whatsoever. That is validating establishing who you are in comparison to the validation and moving on your way in having established who you are. Condoning is doing the same thing. The most blatant form of condoning activity is performing that activity yourself because you are then being the very thing you said you did not design and condoning their actions by being the same way. So this does not mean that an individual in that sense needs to condone that behavior. They can validate it. They can understand that to them it is incorrect and inconsistent with who they are and they can then allow themselves in forgiving themselves to utilize that much more of a level of self-love. Does that make sense? Yes. From the standpoint that I am holding someone accountable who has done something wrong say taking them to court and making them as I said he says pay for the crime that they committed type of thing. It sounds like you are then taking that and putting that person now in the victim role. So would that? That is one way to look at it and in fact you may indeed understand that that is one valid approach but this is how your society functions. This is the framework of the agreements that you lay down. So you can simply do what it is that you do naturally in your society where it becomes self-destructive is where your emotional attachment is so strong and where your hate and negative emotion is so strong that you literally rile and stir and distract your own reality in the process. Therefore you are carrying it around and express it. So by remaining perhaps you can say detached. You can simply allow the agreements to play out, allow the convention in place to play out and not carry around more baggage than is necessary to allow it to do so. Does that make sense? Yes. Oh thank you. Thank you. Shitting. Nice. I'd like you to help me connect with you. Right. In the recent months I've been dealing with my mom on a regular basis. I've been doing a respiratory situation and I've been doing grub look as well. I've been doing reverse my consciousness for breathing. And I see that as a direct relationship to me. Not that she's not breathing and I am but the other day I feel like I experienced a big shift. This slide. Within consciousness. I just felt wonderful things are moving, that's connecting and then bang. Emotional upheaval. Did you allow yourselves to experience the emotion as we have discussed or did you assume that the mere presence of that emotion was perhaps evident that you have not shifted and therefore withheld allowing yourself to express it fully so that it can play out. I thought I did express this question and I responded. Did you or did you not? I feel I did. Oh. I'd like to know where I did. Do you still feel it? If you express it fully you would not feel it beyond what you call several minutes or perhaps hours. If you squelched it and assumed I know I shouldn't feel like this I'm too advanced. Then you will still feel it. When you allow yourself to feel something in that way it is not as overwhelming as refusing to allow yourself to feel it. That is overwhelming. What is the emotion that you found? The first of all not again I felt my offensive urgency with her so I responded to it. When I got there I was able to handle it in the detached way without creating my drama of casting emotions to it. I feel I expressed it. I feel that I did work with this but it's still in my reality and that's why I'm looking at it. What are the dots that you wish connected? I was finding a great dot day until at that moment. Sorry. And then there it was. And I said if I knew that. There what was. The emotion. Describe it. I will assume then that you did not feel it fully. Or if you did you would be quite familiar with what it was. And perhaps in a more conducive atmosphere of solitude allow yourself to begin to explore. What is it that I'm feeling? I understand it to be uncomfortable. Therefore perhaps it is a negative emotion. Allow me to define it. Is it anger? Is it disappointment? Is it fear? Allow yourself to define it. Go into it. When you are able to identify this is the emotion that it is. Allow yourself to feel it. Understanding that if you resist feeling it you will prolong it. If you allow yourself to feel it it will very quickly be evident that it is not overwhelming and has a what you call short shelf life. When you no longer feel it because you have allowed yourself to express it. When you're to the point where you go all right now. Then you can have an internal dialogue. What belief must I have been expressing to feel the fear? You will nail it down. I was expressing this belief very interesting. I know that this belief is not representative of who I choose to be. The belief that is is this belief and state and define that as well. Then you have your choices all out on the table. Both beliefs are true. You get to realize the one you prefer. You decide that that's who you are, trust that act that way and the dots are mysteriously connecting once again. And as a bonus you realize they had never stopped connecting at whole. Simply there was a slow connection between two dots. Do you understand? Not fully but almost. Dive into the emotion. Allow yourself to feel it. Identify which belief you are expressing to have felt it. If that is the belief you wish to continue to express. If not identify the preferred belief. Play around with how a person would act with that belief and express that belief and on your way. Is that clear? Yes. You know, there is a sense of responsibility to her. In what way? Do you understand that at some point she will choose to as you call it transform or die. Therefore it is not your responsibility in that sense to do anything that is her choice. How you communicate with her and what you say to her between now and then is completely up to you. But if you assume the attitude of understanding who you are and effortlessly allowing yourself to express yourself you will not be hooked on any result that she must get anything that you're saying. And we'll simply understand that she will take what she needs, leave what she does not and perhaps you can say despite yourself you will be of service no matter what. But the idea of getting into tandem with allowing it to be service and allowing her to either accept the gift or return it will allow you to feel responsible to her rather than for her. Does that make more sense? So honor her approach and how she is working with her particular approach to allow your contributions to be taken by her in whatever unique way she will not in the way that you insist that they must. Your point of being there is not to change her, shift her, prepare her or anything. It is simply to share who you are, allow her to take what will work for her, allow her to reject what will not and that is the most you can ever do with anybody anyway. Being conscious of it will give you the feeling of fulfillment that you were willing to express who you are rather than feeling empty because she does or does not embrace and implement it. I feel I'm working on the fact that she does not embrace my perspective. Does that not allow you to realign and reaffirm that even so that is still your perspective and your approach? Does it then not allow you to reinforce your perspective and approach every time she refuses to embrace it? And is that not then a service from her? And are you willing to see it that way? Your response will change and that is where the whole interaction will change tone. You're defending your position which is another way of saying you are not completely expressing the belief in it yourself. In other words, we have used this analogy before, perhaps it will be quite helpful here. Individual walks up to you and we use this absurd example to illustrate the point and says you, my friend, are green. Perhaps you wonder for a moment, maybe I'm green. Perhaps I'm green today. You look in the mirror, you're not green. Perhaps you are befuddled. Perhaps you are a little in that sense surprised, mystified. Why is this individual calling me green? You go back to the individual and say, I'm not green and the individual insists yes you are. In fact, you're green or now but you were before. Do you find in that sense that you will create feeling insulted, feeling defensive, feeling angry, needing to prove that you're not green in that instance? Or would you have no reaction because to you it is simply absurd. It doesn't apply to me. No matter what this individual says, I'm not green. When I look at myself, I know it. And therefore what they say has no reaction, no effect from me because it is irrelevant. It is the same thing with anyone who chooses to challenge your point of view if you are choosing to continue to decide on your point of view. That is one way to look at it. It is bigger than that. It is your opportunity to realign to who you are and if you are doing so, most fully even thank her for the opportunity. I really have. But not in a painful force. I have never understood it. I have never understood it fully. I appreciate it. Oh, well do understand that it is a constant ability. It is a constant ability to remind yourself of who you are. Not insisting that anyone else see you in that way. Though as you begin to see yourself in that way continuously, you will find more others will agree to that self-assessment and will assess you in a similar way by convention. So look at where you are rising to defend. And you can transform that into simply restating, reminding, realigning to who you are. Is this helpful? Next to the webinar. So if that is their perspective, it is totally different than mine. It is completely valid and what does it matter what she believes? I understand that. Is that going to stop you from expressing who you are and offering what you have to offer? That is up to you. It does not have to. I am not approaching it but I have been honoring her for a particular perspective so that I can assist her in doing what she wants to do. Not trying to change her mind to my point of view. Oh, then that is truly being the case. What does it matter what her reaction is at all? You are assisting her by simply being there, saying the single word out of your mouth. Anything you say is this. Understand that and begin to trust it and watch what happens. You understand that assistance can be a reinforcement of who you are or can be presented or you are presented with the opposite of who you are to simply remind yourself who you are. Either way you realize, either way you self-define, either way you establish who you are more fully and therefore anything that brings you to that point is a service. And ultimately when you begin to completely grasp what I am saying, rather than feeling a defensive posture, you will feel gratitude no matter what she says. Thank you for reminding me of who I am. How nice. And that difference in your approach, in your response, in your demeanor will be perceptible and can only have some type, although it should not matter in that sense what her reaction is but some type of change to her reaction or her response. Understand? Yes. I have done nothing. Thank yourself. Sharing. What a coincidence. Could you provide a definition for me and your perspective of what appropriate is? Is simply that what you define to be? Appropriate is a standpoint in general terms. You can have what you call societal appropriateness but that is also an agreement and a co-creation and can be quite variable from culture to culture. Is there some specific reason you are asking? It's kind of my reality a couple of times. There are things that are appropriate or not sometimes. Generally that is said with a judgmental tone, individuals in that sense feeling they need to curtail another individual. But only you know what is appropriate for yourself. I find that it will be from third dimensional to fourth. There's a whole lot of difference in what appropriate things are for expression of people. As you create yourself in moment to moment to moment to moment, you will continually redefine appropriateness for yourself. The conflict change. The people and their changing. And to everyone else for that. Almost like clearing oneself. In a sense, when you are able in that sense to honor what is appropriate for you, you usually by convention will begin to seek out and honor what is appropriate for other individuals, not from your point of view, but from their own. As we have shared, only you truly know yourself. No one knows you better than you know you, no matter what they may try in that sense to convince you of. And so therefore by extension, only you know what is appropriate for you. Anyone else is simply giving a suggestion. Yes, no maybe. Yes, that sounds good. Oh, thank you. All right. And walk through. Have a good time. If you wish. At this time, allow me to simply remind you of what you already know foundationally. And that is that you are not beings that are beginning to expand. You are expanded beings who are beginning to express yourself in more and more expanded terms. In the moment that you fully commit to who you are, decide who you are, trust who you are, and continuously act in that way, you are being a conscious creator, which is in that sense the definition of fourth density consciousness. And so you are not truly third density beings moving toward fourth density. Most accurately, you are a being who is now treading on both sides. Many times expressing yourself in this empowered, unempowered terms. Perhaps in that instance, you will understand you are taking a third density approach. Often now you also begin to express yourself in empowered terms, allowing the synchronousity of your circumstances to deliver things to you using, utilizing, acting and putting into action what you know to be true for you. You are then being fourth density. And so you truly now are perhaps most accurately third transitional fourth density beings rather in that sense than either one any longer. Perhaps the way it may appear at first, at first, is that when you are expressing your fourth density consciousness, the dots seem to connect. When you are in that sense expressing your third density consciousness, you have this empowered assumptions that lead it to seem that the dots do not connect. However, they still do. And always when you shift back to your fourth density consciousness, will you realize that what you consider to be dot not connecting was simply a long pause between two dots connecting. As you begin to express yourself fully and consistently in fourth density terms, you realize experientially knowingly, fully that the reality that you used to assume you existed within exists within you and that you still choose to express yourself in time, in space. You still choose to have a distinctive linear experience, but you remove the idea of unconscious. You remove the idea of it happening to you. And you live the idea which is as true that it is happening from you. So I welcome each and every one of you to fourth density consciousness. For at some point or another, you have all experienced and expressed that idea. And many of you continue to do so on what you call a regular basis. Simply being willing to revel in your shift, revel in your change. See where you in that sense are now being the you you always wish to be and also see where your opinion of who you wish to be changes, allow that feedback to come in, will allow you to continue to express yourself consciously, fully according to preference and desire. Deciding who you are, trusting that that decision has taken place and sticks, acting with the foundation of that decision and those actions then seeming to bring back the effects of that decision consistently. Therefore you are already there and it is simply a matter of the idea that more and more frequently you allow yourself to acknowledge I'm already there. I'm already that person. And there was nothing to simply do but acknowledge it. I thank you for your willingness in your expansion to utilize what you might refer to as my stream of consciousness for reflected purposes and remind you that you are the originating source of life. And therefore anything that you revel in is a reflection of you.
