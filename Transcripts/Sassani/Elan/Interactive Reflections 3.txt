 I'll say before we continue around me who ask you a question. Alright? Alright. Are you having a good time? Yes! Oh, thank you very much. Do understand, it is possible in your life to create joy and ecstasy and only experience those realities. When you begin to be willing to validate who you are rather than who someone says you should be, by following your own inner knowingness in the form of your excitement with your integrity, the faith of your life then begins to change and fall in step with who you know yourself to be rather than again who everyone else tells you you should be. When you do so, your experience within your life is interpreted as ecstasy and your willingness to use all your creations in a positive way and simply assumes that everything fits, everything belongs, everything has a reason and begin to look at why you created it rather than denying that you did, you begin to create a momentum as the feedback in that sense corresponds to your willingness to validate who you are through your excitement that we call the ecstatic explosion of coincidence and synchronicity. For very often you do attract the things you say you desire, not in the obvious way that you think you will attract it, but by coincidence, which doesn't mean accident, but simply incidents occurring at the same time, coincidence. Incident is the path of least resistance and will generally deliver to you what it is you desire, though perhaps not only in an unexpected way, but far sooner than if you rigidly insist you will only accept it in one particular form. Your willingness to broaden your definition of what you will accept in your reality will begin to allow the universe once again to deliver things to you over and through the path of least resistance, which again may seem from your particular perspective of consciousness like coincidence. This is synchronicity and your willingness to acknowledge that everything is synchronicity but not stop there, go the next step to act that way, then gives you the results of knowing that everything is synchronicity, then allows you to begin to see why and how things serve you, but it will always boil down to your willingness to act for you, always act anyway on something. One other idea, when you decide to change, when you make the decision that I wish to change, all that you need to do in that sense to realize that change is to trust that you have changed and then act as though you trust that you have changed. And when the subject of trust comes up, very often we hear from your society, a collective psychic groan, oh no, you mean I have to have trust, I have to have faith? Oh no, there goes my reality. All right, allow us to share something we have shared many times before, perhaps you can listen as if anew. Doubt is not a lack of trust and in fact there is no such thing as a lack of trust. Trust is what holds together the fabric of your very reality. Trust is the mechanism through which your higher self expresses as a physical self, the moment that trust is gone, you simply disappear and that trust is in full place, you will not disappear. Understand, it is not that you do not have trust. It is that doubt is an infinite trust in the thing you say you don't prefer. So therefore it is not a matter of gathering up trust, of doing psychic exercises so that you can strengthen your trust. No. It is a matter of realizing and acknowledging where you have placed that trust and that what you again are calling doubt is a trust in what you don't prefer. That gives you the opportunity to look at why you would trust in something you don't prefer and also gives you the opportunity in acknowledging it to then decide to trust in what you do prefer. Simply taking the trust you already have, you do not have to create it, it is there and reapply it, reassign it to the things that are reflective of who you are and it is that simple. You can make it more complicated if you wish, if you need in that sense to have a very complex process to validate the change, go right ahead. But now you may realize that that is exactly what you're doing and you can grant that validation in the given moment and apply your trust consciously as the new you, as the preferred you. How would that preferred you act? If the quote unquote old unpreferred you comes up, the new you doesn't mind. The new you says, oh thank you. The more information that I have, the more choices that I have, the more options that I have, the more enriched is my experience and ability to choose. So thank that quote unquote old self. Your old self wouldn't thank itself, but your new self can. Your new self contains these definitions. Your new self can thank your old self for the suggestion, but then not move, then not act until you remind yourself from the perspective of your new self what that new self would do. And by acting according to the perspective of the preferred you, you are the preferred you and all that ever had you being the old you was the same mechanism whereby you acted as though you believed perhaps something negative, perhaps something limiting. But what we are speaking of is nothing you must learn. You are all expert. You are all masters. You have been up till now, perhaps the masters of limitation. Now you are the masters of integration and therefore act that way. Always when meeting another master, the way that you can identify a master is that master will be the first to reflect. Reflect back to you that you are already a master as well. For a true master fully understands and realizes the equality of all ideas within all that is. So therefore perhaps you can use that as you say as a litmus test. Allow us now to proceed again to the interaction. Shutting. I have to speak about the answer. I think you are a master. And so you will assist many of them as well. And by the way, you will notice in these interactions that again nothing is an accident. And if you are not able to physically ask a question, please keep your ears perked for it will most likely be asked in some form by someone else. Do proceed. If you wish to specify the particular diagnosis, again it is what you would label an infection which in that sense presupposes that there is an outside and an inside and that there is something hostile within the outside that can now get in. It is much what we have already discussed in terms of the need to protect. Now again this may seem a bit nebulous but we can only share what it is that we perceive not necessarily. Now that will suffice. We have discussed it. Look at what we have already discussed. Remain in the moment and use your fear. That is your strongest belief, however, understand as you integrate this you will simply know in that sense if and when to decrease it. Trust yourself. Have you begun mixing the concepts? Now act consistently with the trust in that feeling and that is your answer. What you are now about to share are the feelings of an individual who does not believe that. Acknowledge that and remind yourself you are the new you and act that way. Shut it. You're on. Male, then female. I am breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. It is as exciting to be in the brilliance of your preference as well. Thank you. My question is I need to be in graduate school with new jobs that I've been working with. Sometimes you are all right in graduation. You have an interest in being that field. But I am divine. I almost like technology. Hey. And I mean there are computers. Oh how it sounds. But I need to do nobody's science space. Well you do. Now the question is will you acknowledge to yourself what excites you without the voices of your society talking you out of it. What is my purpose? Your purpose is your excitement. Now allow me to turn this around and ask you what excites you the most. And before you answer simply say the first thing that comes to your mind without analyzing it to death. Are you doing that? Yes you do. Did we proceed on the assumption that you do? What excites you? What moves you? What brings you? What brings you? Great joy. Why? Oh that was not so difficult. I'm worth it. What else? That just comes to my mind. But the other thing is I do not know. I do not know. Oh. If in that sense you are not willing now to conjure up a most exciting thing then again allow us to point your awareness toward remaining grounded in each moment. And what this means is in every given moment each now moment which is the only time you ever experience. You talk about the past. You talk about the future but now is the only experiential time. Notice what the options are in any given moment. What you can act upon. What is available as you say. And choose from those choices with your integrity the one that excites you the most. In each moment. That will begin to first of all perhaps you can say prime the pump of your excitement. And will also lead you to admitting or acknowledging the overall thing that excites you the most. It is possible that knowing at this precise moment what excites you the most because you may not immediately be able to do it may in that sense distract you from what you can act upon. So bring it all back to the now moment. And from this point forward allow yourself to plainly lay out in front of you what you have to do right in front of you what is available and use your excitement with your integrity to choose from those choices. And you will lead yourself directly to your purpose overall but you will be fulfilling your purpose each time you are willing to act on the one that excites you. Is that something that you can do? Yes. It is that simple. Thank you. Now should in the course of this conversation or the rest of this interaction something very exciting that you had perhaps forgotten to share comes up please share it. And we will discuss this further. You may find it will be as a flash all of a sudden. Oh yeah. Forgot about that. Alright. Thank you. And to you. Over there. Come on. Thanks. I am out. It's nice to be in my own room. Oh. Nice to meet you. I have two questions. One is that I am at a bathroom in my room. Oh nothing too. You need to tell me that you are in your center point of power with all possibilities. How overwhelming. I am excited to see you. I am here. I am happy to enjoy this life. I am happy to share this. Well how creative. Why? Do you feel that perhaps you would be so full of joy that you would explode? I am not sure I can smell that. I am just creating wonderful things in my life. I am excited to hear about what you are going to do here. Instead of acting, I am not sure that. I am a terrible villain. I am happy to find what you are thinking and find it first. Anything that's that much. Then you will allow us to explain the following. When we say to allow your excitement, to key you in, to a particular ideal. This does not always mean that that idea will fully play out. Now many times it will. And what will tell you that it will is the continuing excitement in that regard. But sometimes that excitement will be to get you in that sense, get your attention towards certain things that will enable you to learn certain things to perhaps do something else altogether. So what we are saying is follow your excitement, yes. But you need not have a rigid, insistent expectation that it must play out in a particular way. And should the excitement change, trust that? For that change is the reflection of who you are and the path of your own least resistance. Is that clear? Yes, it is. And if you back a lot of the things that I wanted to do were to try to change. And that is all right. But they have done so for a reason. And when the excitement seems to change in that sense, you can either focus on the thing that is no longer exciting to distract you from the other possibilities or open yourself back up to what those other possibilities are and then use your excitement anew to choose anew. Without again getting hooked on a particular result. For if you truly have the intention of that particular result, it will play out. And if you maintain that intention as you change and expand, it will play out. But very often as you change and expand, the intention will change. So it can be either. But you can allow the feedback to be obvious. I feel that I will play and try to give the confidence either for 100, 100,000. Then trust that. And trust that while you are there, it is perfect. And ground yourself and do what you can while you are. Now there is another notion hidden so to speak within there. That is again another societal notion in your society. It is a perspective that balance can only be maintained by experiencing equal amounts of negativity as positivity, otherwise perhaps the notion is you will simply be too happy. But understand that yes that is one way to establish balance. But there are other ways. As your consciousness expands, expansion by definition means that all expands. Your awareness of positivity expands. But being that you have chosen to be in a polarity oriented universe that has the expressions of positive and negative, your awareness of negative expands as well. Now again here is as you say the clincher. For as we have said, thinking thoughts is not the same as experiencing them. It is what you act upon that you will experience. So therefore you can simply be aware of these ideas but not act upon them. Provide alternatives to act upon and the providing of the alternatives and acting according to the alternatives give the positive result. I hear that in my head but what seems to happen is that this energy comes over me and I collapse in my solar section so I go up and over feel it suffering and swiping on the earth and I want to go home. Right. But you are home. And wherever you go you take home with you. And in that moment you may always use that particular perspective by understanding that you are judging yourself. And not in that moment expressing unconditional self love. Therefore, alright, his alright, you need not judge yourself for judging but when it is occurring for now it would simply be hypothetical. When it is occurring use it. Alright, alright, I am judging myself. Alright, that is what I am exploring. What must I believe? Well, what is judgment? Judgment is separating ideas and assigning more significance or weight to one than another. Not in that sense expressing the equality of all things. So alright, I have explored this for a moment. What must I have believed? Well, I believed in that sense that I had not fulfilled my conditions. Ah, that is conditional love. Alright? I now choose to unconditionally love myself. So I forgive myself. Perhaps I will make a note not to do that again. But in that sense I can use even the judgment. When in that sense you say I wish I could split this reality and go home. You are denying that you chose to be here. When you deny that you chose to be here you cannot allow yourself to then see why you chose to be here. That is when reality seems to be happening to you. But when you remember when you remind yourself that you have chosen it and begin in that sense to see why. And even use that particular self-judgmental reflection as a positive perspective in nailing down a belief that no longer serves you. You can turn the whole thing around. And you can as you say midwife the concept we are sharing from your head. Where do you have said we have planted it to your heart? Where do you will then feel it? It's deemed that it's getting more and more extremely dominant totally in my heart and in pleasure and creating and in my twin all real to the other side. At those moments you are denying your excitement for you are judging that your excitement will interrupt your process. And it is part of that process. You will no longer settle for that type of self-denial. So you quote unquote as you say in your slide, get down on yourself about it. But you can catch that, use it and transform it. And follow that excitement moment to moment even if it seems again to lead to no particular end. When you resist that excitement that is what causes the friction that you are feeling. I feel like if I neck in my back I'm very tight and I'm very holding you in. Well in that sense you are not expressing in that sense who you truly believe yourself to be. Hence your throat chakra in that sense is affected. And then you are back in that sense is in a sense reflective of pulling the rug out from under yourself your sense of support. So simply remember that no matter what you all believe about yourself we believe in you utterly. And you can at all times pipe in to the unconditional love of what you call God or all that is. For all that is being the overall creation you are aspects of all that is and all that is does have complete unconditional self love. Therefore there are no conditions placed upon all that is love for you. And simply the knowingness of this now that someone has told you you will feel that this is so. No conditions means you cannot lose the love of God. God will not judge you for that is conditions. You can always by simply reminding yourself of that love create it and feel it. And the moment that you do you can then match it and display that degree of unconditional self love to yourself. Then you are acting as an extension of all that is. When you are willing to unconditionally love yourself you are acting like all that is acts for all that is always unconditionally loves all that is. Does that help? If there is still somewhere you are as you say hanging on. Oh, well. I think this is not, I'm not going to get acting as international as you are coming here. I think that is quite a ground in perspective and it is our preference in that sense. Though perhaps you will explore with your head in the clouds to keep your feet firmly on the ground. But what's been happening is that the start to be through some voices I've never said. They have stopped in my life while I was standing in a body. And it's going to be a third point. It's going to be starting and also something. They have not started in those stories. Now, I do understand. Since you are all infinite, since you are all made in the image and likeness of what you call God, which is infinite and eternal. You truly have no beginning. Now this does not sit well again in finite thought. It is an infinite concept. But therefore you can most appropriately say that you are from everywhere. Therefore, nowhere in particular. Now, how this translates is that whatever you are exploring will bring with it a line of connection to perhaps other experiences otherwise that are relevant to what you are exploring. But much of what you have in that sense created yourself to experience is irrelevant to what you are now exploring. So connections you will make. But no one is native in that sense, so wise speaking, to earth. And therefore by extension, not truly native to anywhere in particular. This is why we say that home is not a place you go to, that you are home. You are the constant. Reality more actually, more mechanically, moves around you. Therefore, home is never anywhere that you will go or get to. It is something you will realize you have never left. So that's because you are tracking me so much because you are relying on me. It is allowing you to perceive connections which are relevant in that sense to what you are now exploring and also allowing you, your own sense of discernment for some of it may simply not apply to you. And you can trust what does, but you can also trust what does not. I have a couple more questions. We should be also the last few or four months. I think it is really important for people. And I also know that there are factors in white weather that are then used as daily type of literature. And the white weather has been coming in from here into medical conditions. I think you know how to do it. It is deeply trusted and every move that you make or every action in that sense that you perform with that as a background concept will strengthen the connection. Actions speak louder than words in that sense. Understand that that particular stream of consciousness represents an assisted, largely non-physical collective consciousness which does aid in assisting your planet but which also from time to time does manifest as the screen individuals upon your planet. I feel a very strong house of connection. And you may physically attract in your near future a physical human representation of that particular stream. I have contacted someone one day and we are studying with that. What do we mean face to face? Will that do? Get out of here. Oh. More was in that sense communicated than perhaps you will perceive on the conscious surface, but that will become obvious as you proceed and move and act according to who you are. We in that sense, though you would perceive us as physical beings with physical bodies, have by choice chosen a more expanded perspective. And we communicate to each other in terms similar to perhaps how you communicate, though tell empathically rather than verbally, but we also acknowledge and communicate on the many other and expansive levels that we create as levels. Therefore, when we interact with you, you being that you generally interact with each other only verbally will only perceive the verbal portion and perhaps some of the, shall we say, visual enhancements, but there is also communication occurring on other levels, and that will enter your awareness as some of the concepts that we are sharing simply being available when they are, and we say most useful. So therefore we thank you. Shitting. Male. It's treating as to you. Good, and Stony isn't here. Are you in the neighborhood? We are, at this timing, approaching, shall we say, a transition from our system to your own. We will in that sense be in the neighborhood, and this will correspond to the gateway that we had mentioned earlier of your July 26. And you're in your scout craft. Wonderful, exciting. I think that I've advised recently that about 500 years ago I came from Pleiades to Planet Earth. Can you confirm any of that? Repeat. That about 500 years, 500,000 years ago, I volunteered to come to Planet Earth from the Pleiades. One moment. We understand the reference and would say that in the way that you mean it perhaps it is accurate, yes. I'm also told that about that time. By the way, told by who? You really want to know? You would say... Would not ask if I did not. This is a little joke. Ha, ha. Are we serious or not? We understand that's the media appropriate response. And a reflexology report done by somebody who also apparently is in touch with the spirit guides of the person that he's working on. Do you want his name? No, not this. Oh, okay. Unless it brings you joy to provide it. No, it might bring him some business. He did an hour long audio take for me and talked about past lives and current and near future opportunities and so forth. So it was very interesting. I enjoyed it. But he indicated that there was a cosmic catastrophe on Earth at about that time, 500,000 years ago. And I volunteered along with a group of others to come to Earth and try to straighten things out. Excuse me. Now, it is not necessarily our perspective that this was the reason for what you're choosing to do so. But very often that will be the negative terms through which individuals will interpret the sensing that they are getting, the predictions so to speak that they are getting, simply because that is the general tendency upon your planet to believe that you need to be saved. But our particular perspective on your reasonings for, shall we say, introducing yourself to this particular system was simply to experience this form of physicality and then assist in accelerating an experience to transformation itself from limitation to limitlessness. For in that particular style of reality, you express a more limitless point of view. Therefore, perhaps you can say an elaborate type of foreign exchange student. I'm getting impatient for that transition, but I guess that. Now, now, that impatience in and of itself is what bars you from it. Stay in the moment. Impatience frustration is not being in the moment and assuming that something else rather than what's right in front of you must be there. Simply enjoy what you have chosen to experience and understand that the ride is in that sense the same as the destination. I was also advised that I would live quite long and end up being a teacher. Well, you already are a teacher and have been. All of you in that sense are teachers and learners, if you will but express that particular aspect of your consciousness. You may find because of your particular exploration as of late that you may find an attraction toward teaching in that sense many of the concepts that we are sharing. One of the subjects you have indicated that one of the constants in the universe is change and maybe only constant in that sense is change yet. There's been implications that there are others and I've been thinking what else might I think is constant and I thought only of the universal law that what you put out is what you get back that might be another constant. Oh, why? In that sense we will confirm. Then I thought of, well, the unconditional love of all that is. You're our role? The great concept. Then I said, well, what about all that is, whether it's energy or matter, is that constant even though it's infinite? It is both. It is constant and ever-changing and again we understand that this does not sit well in translation. Okay, well this is fun. Thank you very much. One moment. Okay. A message to your friend. The present is not a result of the past. You can look at whatever symbols you are creating in the isolation of the moment. If you look at a particular symbol in this instance what you call pain and do so in relation to pain from the past, you create a connection. But if you simply isolate it and only have that pain, be relevant to us right in front of you in the moment, you get a different set of messages which are the messages that will allow it to transform. All pain, spiritual, emotional, physical pain is the product of resistance. Resistance of your true self, resistance of who you know yourself to be. It literally hurts to deny yourself. Therefore, isolate what she is experiencing in the moment. Allow herself while feeling it to simply ask what must I believe to be creating this. How does this serve me? And should she find a tendency for any particular symbol to force her to do something, simply figure out what it is the symbol will force you to do and hurry up and do that thing quick, then you will not need the symbol to force you to do it. All right. Was that directed at me? No, your friend. Oh, it's a he. A she. What you call? Oh, thank you very much. As we were. Thank you. Very good. Shitty. C'mere. Yes, C'mere. Yes, C'mere. Can you elaborate a little bit further on the, what's it supposed to occur on the 26th? That is a threshold whereby enough individuals in your society that are beginning to look that there might just be more to your reality than the N creating your own reality and be able to do so according to preference shall reach shall we say the critical mass where enough individuals are engaged in this idea to create a momentum in what you call the mass consciousness or mass unconsciousness. This momentum then makes it that much more simple for other individuals in that way to begin to choose that reality with that much more ease of transition. This will also relate again extra to rest really speaking because as you open up to the other portions of yourself that you formally label aren't identified or alien to you that external symbol of our presence will simply become more blatant. Does that explain? Yes, great. And we thank you again. There are ancient Mayan ties to that particular date as well and you could say in some senses, some senses that it is similar. Now there are differences and we almost refrain from the label but for the purposes of keying you into a particular vibratory feeling a similarity to what you would call harmonic convergence. Okay, great. A couple other questions. You said in the past that we have forgotten 99.9% of what we know. Hey, on purpose. Right. And you've also said that you, as a sign, also have things that you still have to learn. Hey, and rebel in the joy of the discovery. Right. How much have you forgotten? Interesting. Allow me to scan if there is a translation to compare. One moment. For the purposes again, and this is rather arbitrary, for the 99.99% figure is perhaps not precise. But perhaps you can say more along the avenue of 78%. For understand that what you would perhaps consider most of existence perhaps. Again, this is arbitrary and becomes a bit sketchy to translate is non-physical. So physical reality is but a fraction of the overall reality. And within that perhaps you can say physical reality we have less of a forgetfulness. But factoring in the non-physical approximately 78%. Okay. I talked a little earlier about the Melbec. And I've also heard you talk about how there are different dimensions and different societies living in various dimensions on Earth. And I would assume on other planets. Every planet that you consider to be uninhabited is only so in your vibratory dimension of awareness. There is, shall we say, many, many an infinite number perhaps of overlapping interwoven universal dimensional realities. And in some particular dimension there is habitation, literal habitation of every planetary body. Now when you shift your awareness as a mass consciousness you will begin to, shall we say, begin to see not necessarily in your own solar system at this point. But signs of other life elsewhere for you will be expanded to the point where that other life will be of like enough vibratory frequency that you can perceive each other. But right now your degree of extreme chosen limitation is somewhat exclusionary, puts you of a vibration that does not enable you to readily and easily interact with beings of, shall we say, a more expanded vibration. The mere fact that we can interact with you is your sign and ours as well, that you are beginning to open up to these ideas and have that particular vibration within your society. Otherwise there would be no common ground for our ability to communicate with you. Okay, I understand that. Now in the case of a planet like Melmak where the inhabitants of the planet destroy the planet, does that occur in only one dimension or does that have many many? There are also shall we say dimensions which it did never destroy itself. But the one you are in it has. Okay. And that would correspond to approximately six million of your years ago. Now if that happened over some dimensions that not long, it all did happen of all of the dimensions in which no that was destroyed. Participate in that description. Hey, my definition. You can only experience the reality that you are the vibration of. That was the particular mass exploration. The entire dis integrated point of view. The inner feelings of helplessness whereby individuals not realizing their inner ability and their power to create their reality could only validate that they in any sense had anything to do with their reality where they to dominate the external reflections, which in that sense created what you would call warfare. And to some degree you have seen many examples of this upon your own planet, though we perceive there has been a mass conscious decision to play out shall we say the happy ending. Particularly in terms of your mass decision to not annihilate yourself by nuclear means. Exactly. If you experience people who are diagnosed with schizophrenia similar in a way to that of an autistic person. Different. They in that sense are experiencing realities no less real than your own, but realities which are not mass agreed upon. So there is the constant seeming external invalidation of what they are experiencing which does not allow them to use what they are experiencing because they are quote unquote ab normal. Our particular perspective is that it is to your benefit to realize your natural self for normality is but an arbitrary viewpoint. Therefore what is natural for them were they in that sense to begin to use interact with the reflections that they create literally they in that sense would then derive benefit from them. But when they are invalidated by the society and the individual buys into the societal validations that is what creates the seeming this or lack of ease. So in that way a person who is following their excitement and meeting going with what they believe in if it is not in mind with what the mass consciousness needs in a relative in a microcosmic sense would perhaps experience the same type of system and schizophrenic in that respect. Not necessarily perhaps some of the negative judgment but not necessarily the same symptomology. Is there something specific that you are referring to? Well yeah I'm perhaps last time about my dreams and you told me to face them there and it turned out that I was actually in the process of facing them there in my waking dream and why it was exciting. Yes it was and I didn't. By the way for the other individuals present. We simply suggested when this individual had mentioned being chased in her nighttime dreams to simply assume all the symbols in her dreams are just.
