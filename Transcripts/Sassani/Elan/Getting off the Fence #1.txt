 And believe me, you are perfect creators of your time. Allow me to begin by entitling this interaction, if you will, getting off the setting. As we interact with your society and discuss primary principles of consciousness, primary principles of the creation of and from consciousness, many of the ideas that we discuss can be very simply expressed, for the idea is once again and for the first time, that you do create the reality that you perceive yourself to exist within. And as your consciousness does expand, you do recognize, recognize that the reality that you formerly believe yourself to have existed within exists within you, much as, as you say, awakening in your morning from your nighttime sleeping dream. A discrete experience, a concrete experience, which you then realize beyond the shadow of a doubt must have occurred within you. This particular waking dream that we all, in a sense, share is no different. And in a blatant way upon what you call physical death, you do understand this as your consciousness once again expands and your understanding expands to again understand that your body exists within your consciousness, not the other way around. Now, because all truths are fundamentally true to the individuals that believe them, I understand that the appearances of existing within a body when you adopt it or adapt it can be quite compelling. It truly seems that you are within your body, but that is the degree of your power to create. And that is the degree of your ability to experience an apparently, to experience a particular truth that you choose. All truths are true. And the one that you express, the one that you buy into from all the truths that exist within you is the truth or the belief, if you will, that then allows you to create an effect which reinforces that belief, reinforces that truth. So we speak about belief, resulting in emotions, resulting in thoughts, resulting in actions, and the actions in a physical reality, creating the reality, allowing the circumstances to so to speak, move into place. You truly do not have one belief and not have the opposite belief. It must get rid of one belief and get the other one. For again, as I have started out by saying, you contain it all. It is all within you. So were you to get rid of something? Where would you put it? Were you to gain something? Where would you gain it from? There is no outside unless you are assuming that there is, through that belief, feeling that there is, thinking that there is, acting that there is, and then reinforcing that particular truth that there is or can be, and outside. This is the degree of your great power to create your reality. Therefore, because you contain all beliefs, it is not a matter of utilizing an emotion, for instance, to decide which belief you have, because as I have said, you have all beliefs. What it determines when you trace backwards is which belief you are expressing from the infinity of beliefs that you contain. So when I say belief results in emotion, emotion results in thought and thought results in action, you can also trace backwards. You always act as though you think, as though you feel, as though you express a belief, and the understanding that you contain all beliefs, and express, but perhaps one, which brings along with it several others at a time, allows you in your power to gather yourself back to understand that it is really quite simple to simply change your expression. For it is not that you need to get a new belief, you have them all. So if you feel something, an emotion, it is the result of which belief you are expressing in that moment. That is why you feel a particular way in any given moment. Feelings do not exist within a vacuum. You do not just feel that way just because you can label it that way. You can create an appearance, such as that, but if you decide that you wish to establish who you are consciousness, to be who you are consciousness, you can use these things, emotions, thoughts, and actions as a mirror or a reflection for the belief that you are expressing. You create your reality in a particular way. You express the belief. Feel as though you believe it. Think as though you believe it. Just as though you believe it, the actions create the reality. The actions reinforce the belief that you are expressing. But we will simplify this still further. In any given moment, you simply decide who you are. You make a decision. Sometimes based on the fact that you feel there is no other choice and other times understanding that there are many choices. But once you decide who you are, you feel that way. You think that way. You act that way. Another way to put this is when you have decided who you are, you trust in that decision. And then you act as though you trust in that decision. I have presented this particular delineation before. The reason being because it is quite useful. This is how you are already doing it. And when you say and understand that you make a decision, this implies there are other choices. This implies that you can decide something else. This is where you can express what you refer to as free will. But only if you first acknowledge that you have something to do with the process. That you in and of yourself are involved in the process of creating your life. We have briefly discussed three general phases of transformation from being a completely limited being that believes they exist within a reality to creating your reality consciously and through less limitations, less separation, more integration according to preference. The three phases are very simply kept to awakening phase one. Perhaps again you can say awakening is simply the notion that well, is it possible that I might? Maybe not even create my own entire reality but have some minute degree of decision or choice and how it plays out. That can be as subtle as awakening itself. Now this generally will expand to well perhaps I actually have more than just a little to do with it until it's full blossom to you mean I create my own reality. Even entertaining that notion is part and parcel of an awakening from an unconscious style of creation to a conscious style of creation. So phase one the awakening is simply again knowing that there is a choice knowing that there even may be options. Phase two is the acceleration of this idea accelerating once you have accepted the notion that perhaps you create your own reality and you accelerate this awareness through attraction. You attract to yourself through the desire to be a conscious creator, through the desire to create your life in a particular preferential integrated way, the knowledge, the resources, the timing, the individuals who will allow you to assist yourself in accelerating this awareness and expanding this awareness and you then attract the notions, the tools, the attitudes, the orientation that allow you to understand that only have very small yet rigid assumption resulted in the aspects of your life occurring that you do not prefer. Nothing overwhelming or bigger than you because nothing can be bigger than you it exists within you you are the biggest thing around so to speak. So that acceleration will generally occur as very small seeming ideas. When you apply these small ideas however they replace the more limiting very small other ideas and make great grand sweeping changes in the faith of your life. So acceleration is simply the process of beginning to move faster but you are only moving from yourself to more of yourself. You are not becoming anything better than anything that you have already been or you are always a complete expression in any given moment. Again if it is misery it is complete and perfect misery it is an expression of your creatorhood but again that is generally a product of unconsciously creating, automatically creating without any thought which again takes simple and small notions for granted that when you seem to perpetuate give a certain limiting effect. When you are in the phase of acceleration you attract the knowledge that allows you to begin to transform or replace many of these small limiting notions with more empowering ones. For again you contain them all you do not need to get rid of these old dated ideas and obtain new ideas. You simply choose to express the ideas that are now more representative of who you choose to be or when you awaken to the idea that you can be who you wish to be you then again created the ability to accelerate that awareness to begin to expand yourself according to preference. When this goes beyond mere theory and beyond mere wishful thinking you enter into the final phase of transformation which is simply being the person that you prefer to be without middle steps you automatically then insert the very small motions that create your own reality anyway according to preference because they are who you are who you desire to be so because you already function this way there is nothing really new to master or learn simply begin to allow yourself to consciously attract the knowledge to begin to create your reality consciously according to preference. So in as much as you already create the circumstances of your life through as I have said before just deciding you are a particular way trusting that you are a particular way or having faith or having complete conviction that you are a particular way and then acting as though you trust you are that way you can use your free will you can use your preference you can use your desire to decide anew to decide according to preference you do not truly have a momentum of being a certain way that you need to overcome you create yourself discreetly right now whenever it is it is always right now right now right now right now always that right now and your ability to absolutely make the decision to do from what's available right now the thing that is most representative of who you choose to be is your point of power itself is what tells you well if I can change right now and I do change right now that momentum is just an illusion for if there were such a thing as momentum it would go past right now I would not be able to change right now so either there is momentum or you completely create in the moment now more accurately because you contain it all both are true and rather than allow this to overwhelm and confound you look at this as choices for both are true it is not a matter of proving one of the other it is a matter of choosing do I wish there to be a momentum that I have to overcome which creates the necessity for perpetuating a path and the effect from that path the locomotive train of that path going right past this particular moment or do I choose to understand that right now is the only moment that I function from and if I choose by the way to buy into the past having an effect I am doing so right now and it is not actually the past that has an effect it is me saying right now that the past has an effect right now I will therefore assume that the future must be a result of that path that small motion this small understanding is why you create the apparent that the path has anything to do with right now because you decide you just decide right now my present is a result of my past and therefore my future is dictated by needing to reconcile that path but you are doing so right now you are just deciding you are trusting in that decision and then you act completely according to that trust and you perpetuate the apparent of a momentum you perpetuate the apparent of a path having anything to do with now and the next now and the next now the path does not drift from now to now you recreate each now and that is your point of power that very small minute understanding because once you begin to understand the sensefulness of what I am saying you will understand that right now you can choose something else you can all right get off of that train therefore right now you can decide who you prefer to be right now you can decide who you desire to be and right now you can decide to be that person I decide to be this now as I have said when you already create your reality you make a decision you trust in that decision and you act according to the trust in that decision should you choose right now to be the person that you desire and understand that you can trust that decision everything begins to look different from quote unquote this point forward or each now successive now because you no longer look at it as the older version of you would look at it if you trust that you have changed you will look at it from the changed self perhaps at first you will strive to do so you will reach to do so you will perhaps seem to perform an effort to do so but you will always be able to do so you will always be able to see each situation that you used to label from your older perspective from the new perspective if you simply trust that you are the changed self now as I have said it is always the actions that create the reality so once you trust that you have changed you will act according to that trust and those actions will be far different than the older decision the older trust and the older actions so you cannot help but get a different result using the exact same mechanism you have always used decision trust action this leads me to the so-called fence and getting off that fence should you choose we never insist that you grow more than you wish to that you expand more than you wish to that you have too much fun that you are too happy never do we insist would not be so presumptuous it is up to you but it is an option when you decide I have changed when you trust or say you trust that I have changed but you act the same old way you are not acting as though you trust you have changed and you are perpetuating the older version of yourself and then generally saying well I am doing that because of the so-called path but the older you or the older version of you is the only one who would even think about a path having anything to do with the present and basically using by the way the path as an excuse thinking that you are using it to accelerate but actually using it as an excuse to perpetuate the things you do not prefer because you have this complete free will in the moment you always have the choice not to act not to move until you align yourself to your new decision and to your new trust but ultimately nothing will change until you move therefore you can see a ride you can summarize you can capitalize who you prefer to be and while you are doing so colloquially speaking you are sitting on the fence as you say not until you act on the decision through the trust that you have changed can you actually get the desired result can you actually get the evidence the reinforcement of the new decision exactly along the same lines that you got the reinforcement of the old decision so getting off the fence is your willingness to act upon the trust of the new decision I desire to be this person because this is what I am excited about within myself this is how I picture I would like to be generally you will find individuals wish to exist in such a way where they can exercise their great power to be of service to themselves to enjoy themselves and to also be of service to others the idea of integrity is simply the understanding that if individuals and society and your reality exists within you then it is all an extension of you and the integrated approach is to treat everything in this way which generally translates to respect for the other reflections and aspects of yourself acting upon what moves you acting upon who you know yourself to be with that understanding of integrity can only benefit you and can only benefit those around you and can only benefit your planet itself your society itself being who you truly desire to be will allow you to express integrity and at the same time get what you want we speak about defining yourself through feedback from your reality when you are in a particular right now moment right now only certain things are available in any right now moment only are there unique opportunities and advantages things that are available only in that moment and always will you choose only can you choose in the way you create yourself that linear being from what's available so you can use whatever system you wish to use in that now moment to determine which thing you choose the less preferred approach is to use desperation and the assumption that you are drowning and that you must grasp onto anything that will allow you to not drown the most integrated approach the approach that will allow you to express who you prefer to be is what you generally locally refer to as your excitement or your passion or the thing that attracts you most from what's available in any given moment you will always see in the given moment that something stands out more than anything else having made the decision to be the person you choose to be you have the option to use that feedback system use that vibration within you of what's available this is most me and if it is possible to act upon that thing with integrity only can that particular choice the most representative of who I am and be my greatest opportunity in the moment if something should excite me and I cannot act upon it with integrity that is the external reality feedback that that particular option is not most me because acting upon my excitement without the integrity is not what I'm all about should you again assume this position so if you can act upon something with integrity and do it you get a certain result if you can't act upon something with integrity and push that aside because you will not stand for that there will still be a set of options one will still stand out more than the others and you will find one that you can act upon with your integrity this is the feedback system that your reality sets up that allows you to directly access what you call the choice or perhaps the most likely choice of what you refer to as your higher self that is why something moves you more than anything else that's available and again if you can act upon it with integrity the reality is showing you through an elaborate set of feedback that that choice is most you when you act according to what is most you in every given moment you create an effect first of all in that moment you create the feeling that of all things that are available this is correct for me this is the thing that I can do most effortlessly because it is most representative of who I am by establishing who you are in the moment you rule out other possibilities you get that instantaneous feeling and knowing this that this is most me you also create what you call a causal and effect seeming phenomena in your reality so when you act upon something in a moment there even seems to be another echo effect in what you call a successive now moment so you have a set of options you act upon that option you get an immediate effect what you put out is what you get back instantaneously but the way that your reality a characteristic of your reality is that you also get an echo reflection of that generally approximately three days down the line now if you are acting upon your integrity if you are acting with your excitement you get that instantaneous understanding knowing this and gratification and then three days later generally this is very general there is a positive effect from the action that you have took because your reality is similar to the domino effect where when you take an action it results in a cascading of other actions which then generally brings another effect down the line so three days later you come upon a circumstance and if you have acted from your integrity and excitement that circumstance seems compellingly positive the adverse is also true when you act according to obligation something perhaps that doesn't excite you something perhaps that is not within your integrity you immediately get that effect in that moment but again approximately three days down the line there is some other physical effect from that as well from the successive set of actions putting into play as I have said a cascading effect in your reality three days later something seems to happen which would seem negative now I remind you once again all events are actually a neutral set of props you assign the meaning and the meaning you assign determines the effect you get out of it certain things however do seem to be more compellingly easy to label negative and certain things would seem more compellingly easy to label positive and what I am sharing is that the reason that this happens is that this is the echo from being who you are being positive acting with integrity or not the point of all this is as positive when you begin to get off the fence and act according to who you are with your integrity with your excitement continuously, enormously without interruption without pause three days later and three days later and three days later there is an accumulary effect there is an accumulary echo of neutral events which would seem more overwhelmingly easy to label positive when you continually do things that do not excite you and are not representative of who you choose to be the opposite happens things come along which seem to be very negative if you do both sometimes what is representative of who you are and sometimes not which is generally what most of you do you will experience things that come along that seem quite positive things that come along that seem quite negative and there to be somewhat of a balance of the two now how you act upon any circumstance three days later then determines what happens in that moment and three days later than that so should you have something occur today from a negative thing that you have done three days ago but you understand one moment I have decided I am a positive oriented being and therefore I understand that this is neutral and yes I can say why me and get the negative meaning out of it and then get another negative effect right now and three days later or I can say how is this of service to me now that I have decided to be the person that I desire to be get immediately a positive effect from by the way a seemingly negative action in the past so to speak and then create three days later a positive reflection or effect so at any point you can head off the process but what I am sharing is that when you continuously act as who you are get off the fence and act as though you trust that you are the person you prefer to be you start getting a continual effect of everything that seems to happen to you is overwhelmingly easy to label positive without any of the seeming more easily labeled negative circumstances happening when you begin to be who you choose to be continuously the effect of that is an explosion of ecstatic coincidence of things being delivered to you through the strangest and least expected of past the reason for the peppering of the negative seeming occurrences is because of the peppering of the negative choices in the moment and you can decide to no longer do this you can decide just decide to be who you prefer to be to act according to who you know yourself to be with integrity flawlessly the universe always supports any decision that you make and you have noticed that when you make decisions according to perhaps you can say obligation rather than who you know yourself to be you still get along you still seem to support yourself though as you say generally by the seat of your pants if you wear them you may also understand that the universe is just as flawless when you do what excites you what is representative of who you are and still creates that support still creates that abundance and in fact the abundance seems to increase because it's now allowing you to continue to be who you are if something that you are perpetuating seemingly through making decisions in the now moment keeps resulting in you making a decision of not being in who you are in the moment sometimes the universe will through feedback withhold abundance so that you simply cannot continue to do that and therefore abundance at best seems to be a slippery thing for it is the result of being who you are not being who you are being who you are and finally you saying on some level you wish to always be who you are so the universe delivers whatever messengers will allow you to come back to that center and often this will take the place of having no money no abundance so you simply cannot continue to do the things that are no longer representative of who you choose to be when you choose to be who you are consciously with your head held eyes the universe supports you completely the universe allows you and delivers to you everything that you need in order to continue to be who you are and the reason that the universe does this by the way is because you are the universe and you treat yourself with that respect I use the terminology universe again as a feedback but all reality exists within you each and every one of you a paradox still though it is an aspect of infinity within reality each one of you experiences yourself as the universe and though it would seem like this could not exist at the same time you are thinking in finite terms and the universe is infinite God is infinite all that is as we refer to God is infinite you are infinite you are experiencing finite reality within the infinity of who you are your willingness to get off the fence to act according to the trust of who you prefer to be because you say so because you'll settle for nothing less if for no other reason because you're completely sick and tired of being who you're not is all that it takes to completely transform your life not tomorrow not next month not next year not in ten years not when you retire not right now the only experiential most right now as valuable as any other time in fact it is the only time right now all ideas within you can carry equal weight what you have been is different from what you now choose to be is different from perhaps what you will seem to become in another successive now moment but it is all equal what you are is not better than what you have been is not worse than what you will be now I understand that you can choose to look at it that way and you can create that effect but again you just decide to do so you trust that you act that way and boom you get that effect but if you allow everything to be equal if you understand what I have been has allowed me to get to this point so obviously it was completely valuable then you will not forsake any part of yourself who you were who you will be as simply as you delineate yourself and do parts parts of yourself but it is all you and you are all one homogenous whole being with no better or worse part yes you have less integrated and more integrated experiences you make and assume less integrated and more integrated choices you create less integrated and more integrated realities but they are all equal you may find that you prefer integrated reality it is more effortless it is more reinforcing it is more supportive it is plain and simply more fun but it is no better than anything else I remind you that anything that we share we do not present is better than what you are doing you are flawlessly and perfectly creating yourself right now but you are all within the accelerated phase of your personal transformation so you are attracting knowledge you are attracting resources I am functioning as one of those resources as one of those reflections of knowledge I will not say source of knowledge because you contain it all I cannot give you anything you do not already have and where I do hand you something you didn't have you wouldn't make sense of it so if you are understanding anything I say that is the reinforcement that you already contain you already contain everything you need to continue to be who you prefer to be with integrity to create the life that you desire with integrity you have enough power to create your reality completely according to preference without harming yourself or anyone else that is the degree of the power that you have and we have as well in our society we choose to express this as perhaps you can say the common choice not that we take it for granted or we constantly revel in the wonders of creation but that is simply how we function without as you say for it is our foundation but it is also available as your foundation or you would not have attracted me I am simply again a reflection of your timing a reflection of the knowledge that you are now willing to look at within yourself to simply step from the acceleration of the awareness of your power to the beingness to the final phase of transformation of who you prefer to be all you need to do is decide who you prefer to be trust that you are already that person and begin acting that way therefore allow me to thank you for your willingness to allow me to share in your exploration I understand from my perspective that you exist within me it works across the board so as I discover through anything that you share with me anything no matter how large or minute that I have not been aware of before that allows me to know that much more of myself I get something out of this as well you have much to offer not only yourselves but each other in fact you all have everything you need to make such an offer therefore I respect and am honored by your choice in that it includes me if only for this interaction all well and good I get enough in every moment from whoever I interact with in any given moment I understand that I always have what I need when I need it so if something is not available I know I don't need it and I do not look for it I simply ground myself to what is available and get off the fence and move therefore I know this works but I do not insist that you believe me because I cannot prove it to you other than allowing you to prove it to yourself by allowing you to be aware of it but only because you are ready only because it is your time as you individually expand as you society expand you will become aware not only of more of yourself not only more of your planet not only more of your history but more of what you call the multiverse or universe as well and this is why the awareness of what you call extraterrestrial consciousness is now becoming more accelerated in your society and it shall continue to accelerate you will hear more and more about the various societies that are in contact with your society but we do not assume that we are better than you we know you are equal to us we know you are masters that acting like we are better but we do not buy into that ourselves we know you are our equal you will generally hear people refer to us through the big lease that they choose to express which still may be just a little bit disempowered so therefore we'll hear all types of things about us but the bottom line is we are simply be you such as yourself who respect each other and respect you so greatly that we honor your choices we honor your sovereignty we will only interact with you to the degree that you agree to interact with us now many of you will express that agreement unconsciously but you can use the feedback of the physical occurrences in your relationships to understand what your agreements and decisions and choices are one thing I will tell you is this because we view you as equal we do not believe you are drowning and need saving we do not believe in beaming you up we honor your choices and we honor the courage in which you create many times some of the negative aspects of your reality we do not choose to create those negative aspects in our but can be aware of them through you so this does us service for the more awareness the more expansion the more we know of ourselves and the more we may understand what we continue to not choose to do but you as a society are beginning to accelerate in a positive way and what you are seeing are the remnants of the negativity kicking up in a way to show you in no uncertain terms the futility of the negativity it will never allow you to advance yourself to your society to make negative choices in terms of coexisting but no matter what choice you make you will always benefit for you will always have a discrete distinct valid experience and you will incorporate that into your whole moment there is nothing any worse about negative choices but less integrated choices results and less integrated experience which you generally refer to as negative or bad therefore in honoring your timing and in honoring the sovereignty of your choices many of you have attracted the ability to communicate with us in methodology such as this and if individuals are communicating our stream of thought accurately you will hear this respect you will hear the honoring of your creator and the other descriptions that you hear of us through various sources are assumptions from negative points of view from disempowered explorations now I'm well we desire to share with you as equal and this is why our timing is contingent upon your granting of equality to your cell your granting of equality to your cell your unconditional cell flow will automatically echo out and reflect to those around you it will have a societal impact and it will happen quite quickly that is the basis in which we can physically interact with you but at that point since you will have been acting as an integrated being what we have to offer will not be any better than what you are already creating it will be different it will enrich it but not be better and we do not desire to be an escape from the so called hell that some of you create down here no that is your choice when individuals decide that they believe in us from the perspective of take me out of here in general we will not reinforce their own feelings of helplessness by appearing and doing so only when you approach us understanding that you have your own life and that it is valid and it is completely equal do we desire to then co-create and share with you in a physical way so therefore this can happen quite quickly for as I have said when you on an individual basis accelerate your awareness there is a rippling effect that can be quite fast or quick in terms of what you call time frame but not one moment sooner we would be doing a disservice in interacting with you in a way that reinforces your feelings your choice of feeling helpless in any given situation so just I thank you for indulging me in explaining the difference therefore I can remain either something that you will believe in or not believe in and in that way will not take away from your power now when you make your decisions and choices and create your own reality in a conscious way you will be so similar to me and my society and the many other societies who are shall I say interacting in certain ways with your society already similar enough for us to walk upon common ground but not until therefore I thank you for your willingness to open up these possibilities through the format of these types of interactions where we can still remain equal to you and you can still retain your ability to decide what you wish to decide about what is going on I know I am real so therefore do not need anyone else's validation about my reality I also know that from my perspective you all exist within my imagination anyway so it is simply a matter of perhaps you can say where you are sitting or in my case lying and it is all equal for your honoring me with your willingness to share who you are with me I thank you I bid you my most unconditionally loving posture and ask you how we may mutually be of service to each other through shutting hey Smail how are we doing now were you here for the introduction then you tell me for your decision will then result in your trust and your action and your reinforcement how are you doing perfectly oh I do you really mean yes I really mean that all my next question Elan wow what we're doing now what we're choosing now is that good a choice or is valid experience at any it does appear that a more expanded reality such as you and yours experience is preferable it may not be any better but from our point of view sometimes it seems better but when you say preferable you assume we are somewhere you are not so you are just deciding right here right now I am not he is I will go over there which is as I have just explained not how you will be able to walk with us understand so allow these distinctions to sink and settle in that is why we make them that is why we choose the timing for making them and rephrase your interacting with me from your new perspectives from what we have shared the season now yes from your perspective what is the fundamental reason why we have chosen this experience of limitation because it allows you to discover because it allows you to learn because it allows you to experience things as if for the first time and it allows you to then become more of yourself in a joyous way that is one reason about a year now another reason may simply do be because it's available when you are an infinite being you will sample things simply because they are there do you understand that distinction one of the ways we have phrase this is that anything that creation does not forbid it demands that is why you cannot imagine non-realities anything you can imagine by virtue of the fact that you can imagine it exists on some lessons oh thank you well it depends upon the gravitic field of the planet upon my practice quite arbitrary how do you feel perfect ecstatic joyful gratified that's perfect for me do you wish to feel that way as well I do I know are you all that way I didn't have to hesitate I just felt like I already do and I'm coming to terms with that oh as you say happy trail so sitting on the fence I have been nothing hurt by the way yeah my fucking little sore I'm definitely ready ready to make the job for the lead oh no more but simply because you say yes and I definitely do thank you by the way for bringing it to attention is definitely burning burning issue for me it has three weeks well did not mean as you say to be so long winded but there are so many things to discuss I've decided that I'd like to view on top of the fence though well you may fit there as long as you went but as you say you may wish to understand that I will be quite colloquial that you may not wish to bitch while you are sitting either sit and enjoy the view or get off the fence okay now did not mean to offend anyone who might find that type of verbose simply utilizing what's available through the channel oh my no offense to the channel I'm gonna say that's what the quite an interpretation of his part but I'm not that you're saying we've been talking about that so either enjoy the view or jump down you can always get back up you will not lose the fence I assure you well the fence is perhaps again the in between state between the trust and the action and perhaps sometimes we'll give the best view before you act but again continually simply sitting there can be a bit painful in terms of that you are resisting the movement of your reality absolutely and I know that I'm coming to terms with that trust that's what I'm doing I'm trusting my timing because it's a little painful I'm trusting the timing oh my coming to terms so it is happening so when will it occur when will you decide in a given moment now for what you are saying and how you are speaking implies later well that's my question oh oh this is my question is that okay when you is it let's say there's no I have to a question all right I know what I'm gonna add to go ahead you can ask but if you are already the person that you desire to be would your actions be different yes or no no um yes or you are that person get moving see you later that is how simple it is and I will allow you to look at that oh in contrast if you act on something that excites you out of integrity as compared to doing something that doesn't quite excite you but it's in your integrity is there comparison you know contrast well both are settling for less than who you are so we'll have varying degrees of effect but we'll still perhaps you can say in a sense fall short of what you truly desire okay because I've been doing my work it feels really good to make the money so I can take it is very exciting to me to pay my bills oh but you are assuming from the way you are speaking that being completely who you are would not pay the bills yes why because why do you rigidly hold on to this and clench it it's our society that I've been invited to my society all right what other excuses can you come up I had the jail you know I mean are you going to lock yourself up understanding that the key is in your own pocket by blaming the society externalizing your power and using the society as an excuse it is available of course it is the society if you say so that is the point but do you wish it to be I assume no do you want it to be I assume no do you want to find excuses I assume no so you are the person you desire to be trusted act that way and see what happens definitely a trust issue it's fear to I guess I guess I come in the terms of oh but when you say it is a trust issue you are trusting it is not doubt it is an infinite trust that the thing that you don't prefer is most likely I've done it I have you've done what I don't want to try but I have experienced what we are saying here which you I had a negative effect which is you have not done what we are speaking of here and gotten a negative effect from that you have alternately fluctuated and peppered your soup and perhaps are complaining about the pepper but it was not from doing an exciting thing with integrity that you got a negative effect unless you say so and it absolutely insists that that is not okay because doing doing my work that's fulfilling my integrity I'm excited about to I'm building the house that's really fun but the other day on the bag of bones I need more time to be able to do this exciting thing my project at home how can you do the exciting thing if you fill the so-called moments with the things that don't excite you there's no time left right so you're making your choice you're trusting your choice you're acting through your trust you're creating the effect so I can go a week or two weeks without any money I don't know I got nothing from one thing to another it's a dog it's a physical reality is you are operating on an assumption so I cannot argue with you for you are absolutely correct with that assumption you will continue to get that effect but it is not society it is your assumption do you understand the distinction I do but it's been more about no no no no I said no more advice than you said I guess I guess I'm shifting my perspective on this because I want to say grounded and I spent the last year with my head in the clouds now grounded round is simply choosing from what's available and doing that thing that is grounded that is being physical that is moving around within your reality that is off the fence when you're off the fence and in the action face you are grounded by definition what you are speaking about of head in the clouds without grounded without feet on the ground is thinking about it imagining it wishing it were so and then acting completely opposite you're grounding yourself but you're grounding yourself to the thing you say you don't prefer so building it being a builder is something I've come to terms with I come to terms does it mean settled for yeah oh I know but I know it reminds me there's a reason why I'm a builder in this life all right what is the reason what is the reason I assume if you are going to say there is a reason that the reason is not to be a builder and build things that make you miserable no or attract situations and jobs that make you miserable yes that is one way to express your builder's ship if there is such a word but that is not the way you desire to express it so clarify your intention clarify your vision to decide who you prefer to be you clarify who you prefer to be sit down with yourself how do you prefer to build see yourself building feel the joy and see how you are building what you are building there is something there that you have not even considered yeah is there more you can tell me absolutely not okay well I'm not well it's been like we had me all your Christmas presents and I will unwrap them for you no but I will give you the gift for you to unwrap you have fixated upon stopping fixated begin to understand all right I know the building excites me I know the way I am expressing it at least partially does not excite me some of the aspects of what I'm doing do excite me therefore let me consider them now what else would excite me that I am not doing that I have not considered open the door if you understand as far as the in the building if that is what we are discussing it goes across the board to any interest or excitement that you have but you brought up the building so we'll go with that because it has open door say it excites me to a level that it has I've done it for obviously like you said more than three days and it did manifest something really surprisingly I came out of nowhere somebody author I'm in a partnership of perhaps apply some land that is very affordable to build a house etc etc so that will line up a means of more money later my suggestion I simply give it begin to explore a particular way to apply this for a this strength of yours in a way that you have not considered for now stay with that if you wish all right yes I thank you that is the present you get to open it here's the receipt you can bring it back if you don't want up to you for now that will do I thank you shut it hey hey let the perfect topic because it's just where I've been in the last two weeks I say all off I decided absolutely time and I'm ready to jump in and oh and what I did was I made a decision that yes I can be doing what excites me I don't need anything else to happen in my life I need to do it now and I have a rewrite to do it have you made the decision that you are the person that you prefer to be right now yeah oh yeah did not tell that let me ask you another question will you make that decision right now go ahead all right you made it so are you willing to trust it are you willing to look from anything that occurs from this point forward now that you know you've changed are you willing to look at how you now will handle things from the change you find my confusion all over confusion very invite what I did was I put out to the universe now that I know I want to be I want my life to be a reflection of what I believe I am about and I got a lot of feedback I got some opportunity within a week or so to ask on that oh and I'm really excited about it and here's where I get confused a fancy way of saying but oh yeah I'm very mundane in my life at this moment I decided that on some level I would hope it be a complete level I've decided that I don't need to be a victim anymore I don't need to have scarcity in my life my life needs to be a reflection of what I feel which is abundance and love so here I am with a very old car that's breaking down and I'm trying to ask from what's available my confusion is with integrity my confusion comes about with the word integrity I'm not necessarily sure at this point what's good for me and if I trust that I will have abundance because I determine that that's the reflection of my being who I am and I would go ahead and buy in car and really not concern myself with how to make the payment is that your only option and is that the you who you prefer to be speaking well I can or does that not really tickle your funny book well that's the confusion because the car is falling apart and I'm not sure what my options are with integrity I'm getting very confused about do you as you say require a new vehicle are you driving to a job that you design ah alright so the universe is providing you the opportunity to look at that and perhaps you have created a methodology through which you may become unable to actually get to an expression that is no longer representative of who you are well the sound that I'm doing is really showing you every day how much that is not a reflection of the money oh now have you determined who you are by who I am yes a lot of levels have you taken steps or allowed yourself to begin in any way that is available to attract the shall I say outlet for expressing that aspect of yourself just when all right so things are moving in that direction yes well the workshop are you able to do more than that are you able to put as much of your concentrated intention into this as you have into the thing that is not representative of who you choose to be do you see the difference in your willingness to dive in I understand what you're saying I'm not completely sure how I translate that into action one more can you be doing and simply stating that there is more that you desire to do is clarifying your perhaps you can say order to the universe are you spending shall I say a preponderance of your time doing the thing that doesn't excite you so you do not even have the time to do the thing that does yes but I do it's quit my job and then and you know concentrate my life and get into the workshops and spend more time doing what I think I'm about oh but I don't trust that the universe was important the day I quit well I am not suggesting that everyone here simply quit their job tomorrow you can still utilize the reflection of what you have created and function from what is available with integrity but I am suggesting that in deciding who you are what it is you know yourself to be to put at least as much time and as much diligence and as much conviction into attracting and allowing yourself to research and allowing yourself to explore where you can begin to take action steps for the thing that does it's not exciting your willingness to dive into that degree will allow you to perhaps more comfortably segue from one to the other we'll be getting off the fence I thought I find it works out that I'm trying to get to in a few weeks with my actions well it is one action absolutely but what do you do from now till then do you be who you are not from now till then because when you get there then you will decide to be who you are then you will trust it then you will act then you will create that is your choice but you need not spend your time and I will use the word spend for it is seeming that you are running out in that way if you simply choose now now if you are the person that you desire to be right now because you say so you will keep your eyes out for any reflection in your reality that allows you to act upon that right now each now always from everything that's available we would look to see if there is one option that will move you in that direction and if there is use your excitement and your integrity to decide whether to act on it or not if both are in place it will be quite simple to do so no I should call me no you do whatever you know is the change the preferred you acting trust as though you have already changed and see what happened allow the reality to deliver new options what happens when you change your perspective is what is available in the moment changes and as you act upon who you are in the moment even in the most mundane of ways those actions create reflections that change what's available in the moment and this applies to the last male individual that we spoke to as well. Let me ask you one more question about finances and that seems to be one of the biggest panels. So in translating this into more concrete action if I'm feeling great scarcity by the bill coming in and what I have coming in and I want to believe I'm changed but obviously there is a part of me isn't changed because I'm feeling scarcity. Now that is the older perspective and the trust and the older perspective using an external source as evidence that you have not changed that is not trusting in the change. Do you have obligations that you have agreed to meet? Do you intend to meet them? Do you or don't? Yes. Is it your desire to be able to meet them effortlessly? Oh yes. Is it you that you desire to be able to do that effortlessly? Yes. Oh right. Get excited about it. That is what you will get when you act that way. For you are defining that you and that you meet those obligations effortlessly. Now if one of the things available in the moment is not paying that bill the you that knows you can effortlessly pay that bill does not fret about the fact that they cannot pay it simply understands in this moment it is not an option but I fully intend to pay it and I intend to create my reality in such a way where I can pay it when it comes in even though I cannot pay it right now and it has came in so you reassert who you are, affirm who you are, act upon what is available which then repositions you paradoxically to pay the bill. Oh I love the thank you. Well thank you you have created it. As is timing we will pause for a short break of 10 to 15 minutes of counting and resume in contact at that timing.
