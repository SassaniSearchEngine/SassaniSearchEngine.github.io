 Great things this evening, how are you? Oh, thank you very much. Allow me to begin this interaction with the following observations. In your society, very often individuals speak of the idea of reestablishing a connection to what you call God. Now understand, from our perspective, when you speak about establishing or reestablishing perhaps a connection, this presupposes that you are already separate things and need to then connect between things which are already separate. Alright, that is one perspective. Our particular name, our particular phraseology, so to speak, for what you call God is all that is. We use this terminology because to us it is quite precise and in that sense leaves nothing out. In speaking about the idea of all that is, you obviously would be included in that definition. It is not that there is everything that exists and then there's you aside. No, there is no outside of creation. It is all one event, one thing. The idea is as follows. All that is, is at the same time a self-reflective singular consciousness, but also simultaneously all that is, everything, no exceptions. This is one of the paradoxes of the infinite eternal and multi-dimensional nature of all that is. Therefore you can never truly be separated from all that is. You can perceive a separation. You can create particular definitions and parameters that allow you to assume the position of being separate, but the very eyes through which you appear, the very eyes through which you say you perceive your reality from our perspective, you project it from there, but that's another story, or in fact the eyes of creation itself, the eyes of all that is. You are in fact aspect of the infinite itself, the infinite simply being another label for all that is. You may if you wish entitled this interaction aspect of the infinite. All that is in being a singular self-reflective consciousness, and this is quite colloquial for the purposes of explanations. Perhaps you can say at some point, decided that it would like to know itself. In its raw state, you may say that all that is simply exists. It simply is, and in fact you can say the first phase of awareness is existence itself. The second, again, phase of awareness is knowingness. Knowingness supposes a separation rather than being one whole separating to then reflect back on aspect of itself. So therefore, in breaking consciousness down, so to speak, along a gradient, as you say, the first step is existence, and the second shall we say, gradation is knowingness. The next three separations of consciousness that allow more and more, ten points, fine focus of consciousness are belief, belief systems, emotionality, and mentality or thought. In your physical reality, in general you function from the last three, belief systems, emotionality, and mentality. However, one of the realities you also create, which is just as real as this reality, you call your sleeping dream reality. We prefer to also label that this is a dream as well, for you are very literally dreaming right now, and we will refer to this dream as the waking dream reality. It has its own unique particular set of rules, and in that waking dream, in general, one functions until they begin to expand from belief systems, emotions, and thoughts. In your sleeping dream reality, however, this is not always the case. You also sometimes will create these belief systems, emotions, and thoughts as a methodology for proceeding, but you also in that state experience directs knowingness. And very often this is one of the reasons upon waking into this dream that you are not able and to bring back a memory of what occurred for, there are simply no symbols within this dream to express that knowingness being again, that this dream is more or less seated in belief, emotion, and thought. You are all aspects of the infinite itself. These are simply the ways through which, the filters through which you define yourself and ultimately enables you to perceive yourself as separate from all that is. That is a unique discovery. Cutting yourself off, so to speak. Again, it is only a seeming next. But so to speak from infinite creation allows you to experience certain things. One of those explorations is the exploration you call learning. When you are expressing your totality, and you are one in that sense with all that is, you simply already know it all. So there is nothing you can truly learn, nothing you can discover. So learning, discovery, and in fact, surprise are some of the aspects that you create, this degree of separation from all that is to experience. It is quite from our perspective a wonderful exploration. Once individuals realize that part and parcel of that forgetting, that self-imposed forgetting of your totality is to experience the joy of discovery. Many times this will shall we say take some of the pressure off. And you will understand the things you strive to know are the points, are the road, not the destination. You can understand that simply by even phrasing that you are an aspect of the infinite, you can begin to feel that connection by believing, by utilizing the belief system that you are an aspect of the infinite. And stating that you can feel it for all emotions are always a response to a belief. When you allow yourself to utilize that belief and create those corresponding emotions, you create a vibration within you, and that vibration can be matched by your attitude. Once you allow yourself to feel that connectedness, along with it comes the unconditional love of all that is. For you are being an aspect of all that is truly loved unconditionally, for all that is loved itself unconditionally. All that is does not impose conditions upon part, so to speak, of itself. Does not say, well, if you do this, I will love you if not, you're out. For understand, there is no outside, nowhere to stand it, nowhere to put it. All is all that is. Therefore, yes, even you are unconditionally loved. Who me? Yes, you, even you. There is no outside. There are no extraneous creations. You are part of all that is. You are unconditionally loved, being that unconditional love is the energy of creation itself at all times. Many times individuals will say, well, yes, that sounds all well and good, but I don't feel that. That is because you, in creating yourself as seeming separate, also have an option. You can have the option to actually conditionally love yourself, meaning if you fulfill your own set of conditions, all well and good. If you do not, then you literally and figuratively beat yourselves up. What you feel as a lack of unconditional love is not from all that is. All that is simply automatically unconditionally loves you. It is all in that sense that it can do. It cannot forsake hearts of itself. So you may understand when you feel judged, when you feel lack of self-love, that you are choosing, you are choosing to express within your choices of feeling separate, to feel that toward yourself. And we remind you of your connection, of your being an aspect of the infinite, so that at least at that juncture you can give yourself the option in reminding yourself of the unconditional love of all that is, to feel it. And upon feeling that love, it then becomes a bit more simple, shall we say, to match the vibration of that unconditional love. And to unconditionally love yourself, to forgive yourself for things that you have done that you do not prefer. With again the intention of reconciling those things, and one way to do so is that if a similar circumstance comes around, allowing you the option to do something that you did not prefer, that you use, that you draw on those regrets, to simply not do that again, to simply provide under similar circumstances the positive course of action, which then reconciles having made the negative choice back then and establishes balance sometimes what you call karmic balance. So it is not that you need experience directly one for one the quote unquote fruits of your actions. If you punch someone in the face, you do not need to be punched back in that sense to create neutrality, to even out in that sense that balance. You can, next time you are, shall we say, tempted to punch someone in the face, not do it. And your willingness to not do so establishes a balance. We understand this as an extreme example, but sometimes that speaks a bit louder. Therefore, understand that the unconditional love of all that is, is eternal, is infinite, cannot be lost. If you are speaking about God judging me, what you are saying is you are judging yourselves. For unconditional leaves no room for judgment. Unconditional means no conditions, therefore you will not be judged for not meeting a particular set of conditions. There are none. The conditions are imposed by your own hearts in her knowingness of what is right and wrong for you. And your willingness to follow that or not follow that determines the effects you feel, or shall we say, decrease from without you, from outside, but you are doing the assigning. You are doing the judging. You always know in your heart of hearts if what you are about to do is separate them, this integrative or integrative. Therefore, allow yourself to check in with this inner knowingness and allow yourself to follow your heart of hearts. We particularly again remind you that one of the signs, you are always asking for signs, don't give me a sign, can I have a sign? You constantly have one. One of the signs from your higher self to your physical self in any given moment is what you label excitement. For that vibration is the translation of the energy that allows you to know in no uncertain terms, this is me in this moment from what is available. Therefore, your willingness to begin to validate that excitement with integrity, with the understanding of your integration with all things and acting that way. This means that you always have as much power as you ever need to create what you want without hurting yourself or others. But your willingness to follow that excitement will create a thread, and that thread will weave your life into a tapestry that you will find most enjoyable, most effortless and most abundant. For that is walking in step with your purpose, and that excitement is the sign itself that you ask for all the time. When something excites you, trust that it does not do so to ease you, to which I use, it does so to inform you that of these choices, this is me, this is most effortless, and this will lead to the next thing that upon choosing will be very exciting. Therefore, your search, your mission, your exploration of expansion of consciousness can take that form and can be accelerated when you are willing to begin to accept the sign from your higher self and act upon that sign. Again, it will create a new momentum that will replace the old, you will not be running from the old way of life toward the new, you will be acknowledging the old life and simply choosing the new. So much momentum will it then have, once you are willing in this way to validate that sign from your higher self. Allow us to thank you all for your willingness to co-create this interaction with us this evening. Though there are, shall we say, many individuals out there, there are also other many individuals on our side as well. Therefore, many consciousness ends, benefit from these interactions. We enjoy, we revel in fact, in seeing just how many different expressions, aspects of the infinite assumes. Therefore, we derive great joy in your allowance to share with us your unique individuality. For that gift I ask you now how may I be of service to you. Shitting, hey. Greetings. Elon, this being the case that we are all part of, all that is, all aspects part of, whose source religion are religions on this planet and their holy books, go to great lengths to delineate what is and what is not acceptable behavior and what the consequences of unacceptable or unacceptable behavior are. Who sourced these religions and what is their purpose on this planet? Oh, I do understand. When we speak about forgetting your connection, this was not always the case upon your planet. Approximately for the purposes of an assignment of a value, 25,000 years ago on your continent you label apolantis, did this form of limitation take shall we say eternal? A turn where individuals were beginning to enjoy the separation from all that is, to the degree that they continue to create this separation, continue to create this forgetfulness, to the extent shall we say after the destruction of Atlantis, where individuals simply began to take for granted that they were separate. That was simply all they knew. Taking this for granted there were then shall we say individuals who decided that their job, so to speak, was to allow and enable and to facilitate individuals to reestablish that connection, to shall we say begin to combine with the purpose of all that is. So therefore the religion itself initiated from the separate net and the desire to rejoin from again what we have already explained, you can truly never be separate from. Therefore in a sense you can understand that it was created at least from one perspective as a service. Also interestingly enough though, being that individuals had created a disconnection, a seeming disconnection. They also then began to lose sight of their personal power, that power from within, and began to look outside of themselves for all that they could perceive was their reality for that power, not believing they contained it within, they then began to look without outside into the external world and began to realize that as individuals felt this disconnection, that were they to facilitate individuals toward regaining that connection, that gave them a sense of power, that gave them a sense of prestige. So therefore there is that idea also mingled in with the whole idea. Now it has taken many forms for there have been many translations of the many ideas that have been rendered, both through individuals and both directly from all that is, but once you've translated a few times, shall we say you have a game upon your planet, you call it telephone. You start with a simple sentence and by the time it gets around the circle, it is simply not the same message. You can understand that to some degree this occurs with the rendering from generation to generation. So though there are many aspects in your religious literature that are, shall we say examples of the original intention, there are many distortions as well. Does this answer the question? In part, being one with the all that is, is a ever-present, ever-available experience. And what's required to have that experience is simply an acknowledgement that you already always have it. Very simply, exactly. And if there's one thing that the religions of the world have in common, it is that they state very clearly that being one with the all that is, is not a present time available experience. It is a goal to be reached only after you have efforted and persisted in certain modes of behavior and refrained from other modes of behavior. Of the ultimate dangling parrot. Exactly. And it appears from my perspective that the primary goal of religion was to control people rather than facilitate you. Do you understand there are individual systems here and we wish to facilitate? They perhaps do in so and of not having all the facts. But it is not that cut and drop. All ideologies are tools. This means that those who choose to use them can get the result. We are not saying that religion does not have the end or by product acclaims. It can for individuals who choose to trust in that particular way. What we are saying is that if there were only one way, there would only be one person and look around. There are many ways. If one way works all well and good, but there is no reason to assume that that is the only way. One of the things that you explore upon your product most obviously, even by the discrete expression of five different races of mankind, is variety. Therefore utilizing again your terminology, there are many ways to own. But you need not invalidate any tool. All tools are valid for those who choose to use them. So rather than concentrating on the shortcomings of them, simply decide when you are viewing and exploring a tool, is this for me? Does this work for me? If it does, use it. If it does not, take it. For it has allowed you by the process of elimination to get one step closer to the tool that will work for you. And there is simply no reason to invalidate any ideology for invalidating it does not give it less weight and get rid of it. It gives it more weight, places more attention upon it, and actually causes it to have more of an effect on you than more you to validate it and release it. You proceed. It seems that what we have here is an infinite potentiality for choice and choosing that mode of experience that you prefer. Yes, yes. No choice is any better or any worse than any other choice. No, but some are more integrated and positive and some are more separate and limiting and negative. We are beginning to seek about the positive choices because they are integrating, beginning to collect back what you have formally considered parts of yourself into one hole, whereas separation has you seeming to be, shall we say, alone, caught in the tide? Smashed on the rocks by the waves and so forth. There is nothing any less valid about that exploration, but our particular, shall we say, orientation in interacting with members of your society is the introduction of the more positive, integrative ideas, where they allow people to take back their power and begin to create their life according to preference. And very often individuals who claim that they wish to explore the dark side, the negative side, also themselves wish to have that same inner love. So therefore many times they simply do not know how to express it and think that externally will be the only way to reconcile it. But it is all an internal reflection anyway. We have reminded you of it. Your reality does not happen to you. It happens through you. Is there something else? Yes. It seems that even though both experiences, integrative and separative are equally valid, man does have an inbred predilection to seek pleasure and avoid pain. And in fact will do much more in way of efforting to avoid pain that he will to seek pleasure. Now be integrative with that. By the way, you are simply elucidating on certain observations which in and of themselves are as valid as any other, but why are you focusing upon this? I'm focusing upon this because there seems to be an in an eight cents or a the idea that's held by many is that pain is to be avoided. Pleasure is to be sought, feeling good is better than feeling bad. As much of this does not assume that you create your own reality and that you can only experience the reality that you are the vibration of. If you are the vibration of unconditional love, assistance and in that sense being of service to individuals, there simply is no reason to hear which is believing a reality you do not prefer as most likely pain. For you are not even likely to attract it. It is what individuals are willing to issue pain to others that they then feel perhaps that they deserve pain back and then need to avoid what they feel they deserve. But it is all a matter of where you are focusing your attention. The avoidance of pain and seeking of pleasure in that automatic way does not assume you have your own power. You create your own reality. You decide who you are. You decide your perspective and what you decide. Then is the vibration that you are and then that is the reality you experience. You are removing that creatorhood by the mere asking of the questions. Is that clear? Yes, but since you do create your own reality, does it follow that you can follow an integrative path or a separate path and enjoy as much pleasure in either? It is depending upon your definition of pleasure. Perhaps you can say in some overall sense that it is true for it is just as valid an exploration, but your society in 25,000 years has done it all. Therefore now is the time of awakening. Now is the time of transformation. Now is the time in having explored this separation of negativity and limitation to begin to choose to prefer to consciously express that joy in integration. Let me just now simply is the integrative path. Is there more pleasure and less pain inherent in that path than in the path of separation? In the way that you mean automatically, absolutely and positively. Can I move in? Okay, thank you. The idea again is as you expand your consciousness, because you are in a world of polarity, positive, negative, you will become infinitely more aware of both, not only the positive for that would not be too expansion. But what you experience is up to how you choose to move what is your premise, who you are in your vibration. So therefore you can be aware of negativity all around you and need an experience if you decide that you will walk according to your positive purpose. So therefore it is not a negation of that negativity. Again, you will be peripherally aware of it, but in changing your vibration, impositively aligning your purpose, what changes is what you experience. So yes, automatically, since you are unconditionally positively serving, and not shall we say rendering pain to other individuals, you will not experience personally that pain. You may however, because you still have chosen to exist in such a world, be aware of the pain of others. This is the distinction. The difference between being aware of something and experiencing it is that clear. Yes, it is. It helps. And then perhaps you will return to me. Along with perhaps the same line. We have not, by the way, perhaps the more of the line is faster. Yes. A certain portion of our population assumes beliefs that we find radical or nonproposable, whatever. For example, they may prophesy the end of the world and all retreat into caves, expecting it to be nothing to come out of the future. My question here in this regard is that if they genuinely have the belief that it is the end of the world and they go into those caves, do they have that experience? The idea is this. One of the things that we have discussed is what you label parallel and probable reality. This is only one expression of reality. If there is perhaps utilizing your example, a portion of your mass consciousness, individuals who wish to burrow into the ground and truly expect that result. Yes, they will walk out into a devastated planet. However, from your perspective, they will have simply went into the caves and never come out. From their perspective, they will come out to a devastated earth, which is not literally the same earth that you are upon. Their vibration, being to agree to a vibration which is different from the consensual mass consciousness agreement, still allows them to experience that reality but spins off of parallel reality or another reality scratch that allows them to experience that without interfering in your reality. Does that make sense? Yes, therefore, the definition holds that which you most expect to occur does shape your reality. If you are truly being honest with what you expect, yes? Right now, if an individual or group is some perspective that perhaps I think most people would find your project destructive, nonsensical, whatever. Do they reach their goals simply because they believe in their reality that that is the way to make things work there for their belief simply makes things work? It depends what their goal is. In general, they will generally create any of the effects that they are doing to others to happen to themselves. So it again depends what your definition of their goal is. Perhaps an extreme example would help. He thought that he would create a more pleasant world for himself by eliminating a lot of these people. To his perception and those that proceed to share to that perception, if they had completed that reality to their satisfaction, would they have created a world that would have been pleased with what they have met their goals? Perhaps you can say yes, but understand that one thing that you are not mentioning that is part and parcel of this picture is the amount of fear instilled not only in that individual, but the many individuals who, while they were hating to such a degree, also did fear being hate-ed because of the energy of putting out that hate. And it was the fear itself, so to speak, that wound up being the downfall of that scenario. And that's the second part of the definition of reality to also believe it was integrity and that would be the fear you were talking about. Well, perhaps again, as we had said earlier, you always know in your own hearts what is truly right to you. And if you are acting against that, you may generate particular emotions. One of them may be fear. Fear again is believing a reality. You do not refer his most likely. Obviously that is what occurred to that individual. So they had mixed feelings at the same time or mixed beliefs. And if they did not, they would not have been the negative manifestation of wishing to exterminate a large portion of the population of your planet. The conflicting value system of... What slows me down from creating my reality will find one of the parts on the right-hand side right now. Like, why don't I create it? Because if I truly understand the reality of that, which I simply believe is most likely to occur, then that should empower me to create whatever it will. Many of these, but one of the, shall we say, rules that you impose upon yourself in this particular reality is what you label cause and effect. And in creating the idea of experiencing the unfoldment of time, also a particular lag between the having of the idea and the manifestation of that idea, you can, however, shorten this process quite a bit by being willing to begin to act according to preference. But that is one of the foundational definitions of this reality. Now, understand the following. You do have the ability you are saying. However, it is expressed in another portion, no less real of the reality. Again, what we had earlier discussed, nor sleeping, dream, reality. Do you not, in that reality, simply have a thought, turn around, there it is. That is what you are seeking of. However, when you wake up, so to speak, into this dream, you are, shall we say, choosing to play by a particular set of rules for the time being. And one of them is this lag between the having of an idea and the manifestation of it. But your willingness to act according to your excitement when having the idea accelerates the process and allows the two manifest in the fastest possible way, where you are now operating as, sometimes you say, your electricity does, along the lines of least resistance. So it can be quite fast in that way. Is the process that I define myself between the idea and manifesting the creation simply that item that's most things now, or are there physical rules to get in the way? Well, in other words, the item that we are seeking of are the physical agreements. They are only rules because you agree to that. You can break, in that sense, your agreement with the mass consciousness, but very often in doing so. If you manifest something in such a way, others around you who have agreed to abide by those rules will either not pursue it or not acknowledge that you did it in that way, and in fact not be able, in a sense, to believe that you did. Understand the complexity of the agreement. Okay, so all the final sense of this, my definition is the process required is the only inhibition. Yes, and your willingness to act upon your excitement flawlessly with integrity will accelerate any manifestations who happen very quickly. Where you generally create more time is when you ignore or go against, so to say, the grain of your excitement. It actually takes more effort, takes more time to deny who you are, and act out of somebody else's set of who you should be. Does that help? Yes, also somewhat in this indirectionalized question. Are you familiar with the concept we call old tapes or tapes playing in your head? All the experiences that we no longer prefer, but they seem to have a durability that's astounding. We understand the concept. What would your suggestion speak to most effectively eliminate them, transmute them, whatever? First of all, acknowledge them. Try to get rid of them, pushing them against, shall we say, the boundaries of your reality. Remember, there is no outside. If we give them that much force to spring back to you, act out. So first thing is don't deny them. Acknowledge them. Second thing is to go through a process that we have sometimes shared of acknowledging all aspects of it. Not only that you have that belief, but again, the three phases of awareness we had shared earlier. Save the belief of the quote unquote old tape. Allow yourself to truly feel how it feels to have that belief. Allow whatever thought occur, having that belief and those feelings to simply be obvious. Then watch how a person with those feelings and thoughts act. You will see a distinct and discrete set of actions that you follow along so far. Then you save the new belief versus like a screen so you don't get confused. Allow the new corresponding, perhaps more positive emotions to be mustered up that corresponds to the new belief. Allow that to generate thought and watch the actions of a person who believes that. Where you get to choose to play the new tape rather than the old tape is by giving yourself the benefit of seeing both actions. It will not be difficult to choose one. The action reflective of the preferred beliefs will always be preferred action. And once you have afforded yourself even seeing that that's an option, it becomes quite simple to do it. So again, it boils down to the action state. Seeing how you acted with the old tape. Plugging in the new tape, seeing how you then act. Comparing those actions, preferring one and acting that way gives you the new reality. When you then have the new reality, the old tape, so to speak, never goes away. There is no outside, nowhere to put it. It simply has no relevance to the new reality. Your relationship with it has been transformed because you have not denied it and instead done something else really believing that's most true. But you have acknowledged it, equalized it with the belief you wish you had and simply out of preference, out of conscious commandment, chose the new belief and then be willing to do again how the universe perceives that you truly believe something at that point. That is simple. What does that happen? Just need to do this. And we thank you right now. Sure. Hey. Good evening. And we're going to do you? Yes. I have to ask a question. Oh. One of which I've been told about a vortex that is on my land. Would you please complain this vortex? A location. A location would be on to the left side of my house. How did you feel about it? Through another being from the interplanetary, let me get this straight in my mind. Confederation. Oh. And we are not aware of that particular idea. But however, we suggest being that you attracted it, that you trust whatever sources that be relevant to you. Right. And I do trust. They also stated that there was another vortex that they wanted me to seek out for myself on my own without telling me where it was, which I will do. Did you access this confederation within or utilizing an external source? Actually, the external source was in Southbury where I lived. Have you utilized any of your internal connections? I'm using my internal connections more and more as I'm tightening more of my inner awareness. What has that allowed you to discover about yourself? About myself. That I have the power within myself to have answers within myself come forth. Oh, thank you. Good to see you. The other thing is, can you explain the very extraterrestrial societies that are around my house on the land that we cannot perceive at this time? Why are so many of them centered on or around my house? I understand before you answer the question that since birth these extraterrestrials have been with me through all my travels, and before we moved to Southbury, they were not there until we had moved there on the land. Can you explain that? Well, first of all, our perspective slightly differs from what you are showing. We have already explained to you your connection with Pleiadian energy. Our other sensing is a connection that is somewhat more peripheral, not perhaps directly related to you, but you will become aware of it through other individuals with particular. These are our only immediately obvious connections. Therefore, anything else you perceive as a connection, we suggest you explore on your own. Right. The other question I have is related back to my mother. I had talked to you in previous times about the lights that my mother saw about one and a half two years ago. I have been explained of that that they were extraterrestrial spirits making their presence known to her at that time. That is not exactly our perspective, my proceed. Okay. Well, this was sent, what was actually told to me was that that's what it was, and can you explain your perspective on your own? In all perspective, it is as follows. There was the witnessing of spacecraft, dematerializing. Yes, evenizing that particular term that we have explained many times upon isolating our shifts from time and space. From our perspective, everything else, so to speak, seems to disappear. From the perspective of your Earth, the shift seems to disappear. But there is in between sometimes ghost-like appearance, not at all. Well, it was pretty low, according to the ghost-like appearance from what her visual, what she visually interprets back to me, and now having a more clear understanding. Before it was too materialized, can you give me any idea of how large the actual shift was? Our particular perspective is from approximately, and again this is a range from 42-60 feet in length. Okay. And what would be the actual height of the shift? You can't really, you can't really, you can't really, I think. One more word, sir. This will be approximately from 16 to 20 of your feet. Okay. Now, the actual visual interpretation that she went through of the camera, the camera, the realization of the shift, I can't, it's not that working. Can you speak up a bit more still, all individuals? Okay, yes. The breaking down of the actual ghost-like appearance of this vessel, was it perceived to her for a purpose at that time? In a sense, you can say she simply caught the transition and whatever triggers that pulls within her will be her particular purposes. So purposes of those beings are simply observation and to some degree, reconnaissance. Okay, reconnaissance, observation. Now, when you say reconnaissance, could you go elaborate more on that? No. Did you expect that, right? No. Congratulations. Thank you very much. Welcome. I have, as I told you, I will pull it out, questions for you tonight. You always do? Can dreaming about cross circles create one if you have meditated in a farm field or any field? In general, it will simply be a thing when it's awareness of its creation and not actually the cause of causes. Okay, it's my understanding in England that, from an article I read, that some people actually, where the cross circles were, were appearing, that they meditated in a field and thought of a circular cross circle, and then the following day, the cross circle was there. Yeah, you put up the stand from all perspective, they did not think it up. They simply shall we say, retrieved from an available menu, the better-wording existence. I see. And we have the available menu within all of us. So, it will vary you, actually you to lie to the map. Which one? Uh, going on to another question. On our other civilization. Are there any questions about this planet? About this planet? Yes, what about this planet? Where do you live? This is your life. Good question. Are you living for your everyday existence? Well, I'm asked, what about this planet? Is there anything you'd like to share with us? It's very exciting for all of us. To begin to observe a civilization that, in approximately completing a 25,000 years cycle of limitation and its separation, are beginning to transform. Are beginning to expand. Are beginning both individually and collectively to begin to think, perhaps, they do contain it within them. And as you do, you then begin to match the vibration of our particular perceptions. We already take this for granted. Therefore, it is exciting for us that you should choose as a society to begin to raise your vibration to become, shall we say, citizens of the galaxy as well as your own planet. Very exciting. It is a very seemingly exciting. I have one other question. I have others that I'll hold off on them for later. Are there other civilizations that enjoy eating various types of food? And as we do on Earth, and also, will there be a time on Earth where food will not be consumed as much as it is now? And if so, how will we survive without what we call food? The answer to question number one, yes. There are many civilizations that enjoy that style of writing. The answer to question number two, yes. Your civilization will also, in that sense, begin to lose what you consider to be physical symbols. One of the results of seeing yourself as separate being cut off from the ins... That provide sustenance, and you believe they make you complete. As you begin to take back your own power, as you begin to walk in a purposeful way according to your path in preference, you will literally become a higher vibration. You will literally, literally, begin to lighten up to become more of a light body. As you do, you will literally become becoming more non-physical. And as you approach non-physicality, you begin to lose the usefulness, lose the reason for particular symbols. Physically speaking, when you are still physical and no longer choose to create the necessity for that type of sustenance, your body being that your consciousness has been transforming all around you will also begin to transform to reflect the new form of your consciousness. One of the forms this will take will be your ability as a biological entity to directly exchange energy with your environment. Therefore, you will lose those symbols. But only when you are ready, you do not have to give up your feet. So in fourth density, which we're going into, where we're still going to be physically able and body, we will still have the options of food when we want. And it is, shall we say, at the end, so to speak, end, home stretch, so to speak, of fourth, you will begin to lose those symbols. But you will revel in a new relationship with them when you are still physical, yet expressing your expanded consciousness. For you will not have the idea of overweight. You will not have the idea of being that are bad for you. It will simply be the joy of the discovery, of the joy and the pleasure of simply consciously utilizing tools, realizing that that's just what they are, tools. I have one final question. Oh, no. Yes, I have one final question. The second final question. We on Earth have a particular DNA genetic structure in physical forms that both the men and women. In fourth density, will we eventually evolve to look less human than we do now, or will our DNA genetic stay the same if we so desire, have other civilizations in the multi-universe transformed from human to non-human or vice versa? In the way that you mean some have, in your particular instance, you will generally resume or retain a degree of humanish, that though perhaps some of the encoding and we will not get specific on your particular DNA structures will alter. Again, DNA is, shall we say, part and parcel of the makeup of your physical body, and we remind you that your body is within your consciousness and not the other way around. It is an expression of your consciousness and not the other way around. So as you change that consciousness, as you alter your perspective, being that this is a reflection of that, it automatically changes and transforms. So you will perhaps still have something you call DNA, but it will differ. Let's see. I'll come back to my last final question a little bit later. Oh, what? Shit. Hey. Hey. At present, we're virtually obsessed or certainly fascinated with the whole idea of eating, drinking, and sex. It is a... You'll have won an entirely inhabited this evening by manals. Yes, I know. I think most sociologists would agree that that's what makes the world move. That is one particular disempowered. You are the same as the animal's perspective. Well, what I'm noticing from your response to the last question, or what I'm thinking is that we seem to lose the necessity to eat at about the same time we lose that type of sexual expression. In one point, 40, you can understand that your ability to exchange with other consciousness is, in a sense, more transcendental. And as you lose the symbol of physically eating, you may, shall we say, transform the physical way that you interact sexually, but never, shall we say, for the intent of this conversation, will you lose the ability to exchange energy as to revel in the energy of each other? It simply changes form, and it's less of a physical act and more of an energy exchange. Am I accurate in conjecturing that what's actually happening is our focus of attention is moving from introverted to extroverted, and as we expand our field of perception and encompass more and more of what's available, that we tend to get past things like eating and the drive for sexual procreation and get more into an expanded experience of being one with the all that is. Can you rephrase that a bit more concisely? Yeah, are we moving from introverted to extroverted perception? In one form of that meaning, but in another overall form, you are moving from the desire to validate your reality externally and begin to do so inwardly, so it is reciprocal both. All occurring simultaneously. Do we actually have more and more of an experience of... One of them, allow us to also add and again remind you that the reality that you believe right now, you exist within, exist within you, so in that sense, is introverted as well? Yes, my question was, do we begin to have more and more of an experience of traveling without moving? In a sense that all the traveling already is, but perhaps you can say your perspective shifts to be able to perceive it that way, yes. Thank you. And to you, at this time, allow us to pause for a short break of 10 to 15 of your minutes of challenging. We will resume contact at that time.
