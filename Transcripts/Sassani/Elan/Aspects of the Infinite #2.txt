 Alright, I'll say continue setting. Hey, female. Thank you a lot. We're balancing the energy. We're fine. Oh, don't talk. I have a question about the dream state. You said that we're going on dream realities and the nighttime sleeping reality. And that's when we were close to our knowingness. In a sense, you can understand that you have more access to direct knowingness, not more access to the divine part of yourself, but also understand that in this reality, more and more, you will find in this waking dream reality tapping into that knowingness. As you expand, you will in that sense begin to expand beyond doing systems into knowingness from time to time. So it is not, shall we say, impossible to experience that knowingness in the waking dream, but far more shall we say likely and common in what you consider to be your sleeping dream in that you separate the two dreams. Our perception is that as you expand, you will blend them into one waking living dream. Okay. Then how does that accessing that knowingness in your sleeping dream relates to nightmares? What we term as nightmares. Well, sometimes it will simply be tapping into particular scenarios that you wish to play out in physical terms, though not midwife then, so to speak, into this particular reality. So it allows you to access that without having in that sense to live in this reality. One other reason is that you do and that you create yourselves to be, shall we say, be that chop yourselves up into little bits and create nights, and partners to file those bits in, that many times some of your core peers or issues which you will not allow yourself to look at will in a sense force their way, so to speak, with your allowance to the forefront in that sleeping dream reality where you will enable yourself to look at them a bit more open. Was that the purpose for us separating from the waking dreams and sleeping dreams? Why did that occur? Well, as you became more and more of a limited focus in consciousness, you began in that sense to disregard the more malleable, the more, shall we say, immediately manifesting portions of your consciousness, but since they still existed, you created very creatively a compartment, a place to file them, and this is your experience. You, in waking and living this dream, with a particular set of rules and parameters, and the ideas that you have separated from this, you then access, shall we say, on quite a regular basis. So you are quite literally even this waking dream, always in touch with other aspects of your simultaneous being. Okay, so that would explain times that I find when I know I'm in my waking dream, but I can't tell if I'm in a sleeping dream or the waking dream. That would explain the merging of those two? Oh, very good. This is one of the symptoms. Where you begin to ask, well, did I dream that, or is it real? As the line begins to this off, as the line begins to literally be erased by you, that is one of the symptoms yet. One of the other quote unquote, symptoms will be the idea of waking up with no ready memories before you will begin to cease to make the separation. I don't quite understand that from that. In other words, should you find that your whole life, you woke up with vivid memories of your dreams, and this begins to, shall we say, ease up or cease altogether? That is another symptom of blending the two realities. Okay. No. Well, I'm stuck in a coin here. I'm trying to put the question together. Oh, let's unstuck. If you're merging the waking and the dream reality, the waking and the waking and the waking and the waking and the merging of, then you have that unlimited ability that you appear to have in your sleeping dream. Well, this is what happens. As you begin to broaden your definitions of this waking dream, things which formally seem impossible, the stuff dreams are made of, begin to express in this realm of the animals at a comfortable rate, a bit at a time, but again, as you do, you will find this reality to be quite a bit more malleable. You will find time will have a different relationship. You will begin to more immediately manifest things and simply no longer have the need for the delineation. Will you say time has a different relationship? Because the whole of an effect that we spoke of earlier, there will be far less of a lag. There will be more of an immediate creation. Also, understand one way that you can facilitate this is very simple. To draw relevance from that reality into this one gives validity to that reality and how you do so is this. You have a particular dream. You wake up and you remember it. And perhaps you explored something in particular, either positive or negative, in any way that you can imagine, utilize what you have just dreamed to form a concept that you can then act upon in this dream. If you are willing to take actions based on learning, expansions and exploration in that reality, you begin again to erase that line. So should you learn something about yourself in a dream that you can then wake up and apply, go right ahead. That allows that dream to now become fluent with this one. Okay, so there are certain times when I feel not so much that did I dream it or did it really happen, but when I actually have to stop in moments saying where am I? And the sleeping dream of the waking dream is exciting. Well, it is a little awkward at times, but it is exciting. Always. You will ease into that and not feel so awkward. But it is again that line beginning to dissolve. Okay, because the message I got was that I needed to know how to walk with a foot in each world. So that is the dissolving of the line. Very very little of the thing. This is so. And you are a dream-wapper in bold reality. Perfect. Thank you very much. Oh, thank you. Sure. Congratulations. Steve, how are you? Me. Hey. Since I came out with this disease, many people have suggested things that could do to cure myself. And my question is, if I really believe that myself will work on if the back passes through, please let go of it. Oh, thank you. No, it is truly and simply and solely your belief. Now, understand when others believe a particular thing, that gives you the option to agree with them, and you are agreeing with them, is your belief. But it also gives you the opportunity to say, now now, I appreciate your point of view. Perhaps I agree with it in my past. But now I do not, and I thank you for allowing me to remind myself that I do not. And you can use even their opinions in that way. But may I ask you a question? Sure. Do you consider that you still have a disease? No. Oh, thank you. But in the beginning of the phrasing of that question, you did say that this is that I have. Okay. And perhaps we have this gun that you no longer need to retain that signal. Okay. I also never watch out because you used to say, well, I saw you from my past decision. Oh. I'm very much better in walking about two miles and doing things on the cover time of the week. And I found that an interesting experiment, I thought that the shaking of the principal's mind, my routine, would not be controlled. That would be controlled by a big disease. But besides my experiment, so in the same hand, I could continue to such a new end of the day. Oh, of course. And even in the interaction where we shared it, did it do so? But you erroneously thought that we had done something. You had done something. You had made that commitment, perhaps utilizing us as a single. Now you can go forth and use yourself as a symbol. I want that from the interest of the whole world. But the chair came up with a nation-on plate for the show 15 minutes for a practical interview. So I think the interview is a proposal for the hospital to pay which part of the age. And these that prefer the JK chart can be charged. From all perspectives, it is no big news to most. It is simply now validating what many have thought. What will sometimes amaze us as the individual who believe the original explanation. And who you are. Shut it up. Shut it up. Man, that's it. Good evening. It's been a little while since we've spoken. In this format? Yes. I wonder if you know Sasha, the Palladian woman. We are aware of the overall energy. Perhaps you can say I directly have not met her, but I understand what you mean. Has anyone on your planet met her? Yes. Okay. I'm interested in talking with you a little bit about my friend, Ken, in here with all the final questions. Oh! He is a person that has taken the extraterrestrial issue to the extreme in that he really loves this type of interaction. He's brought about this awareness to many, many people on our planet. He's also co-founded the intergalactic informational exchange network, radio and TV network, along with myself. Oh! And I would like to know more about what is the connection between him and the state of reticulae. Well, again, it is horrific that he will find many individuals coming into his awareness that have interacted directly with him. The quote unquote, abduction that take place between extraterrestrials and members of the ostracized, which, by the way, we prefer to call temporary detainment, are usually that particular society. And therefore individuals now abandon it as a period of literature, and your media a little bit more are beginning to come forward. Such individuals as the both of you who are beacons of interest for individuals who are interested in these subjects will find herself, shall we say, being attracted to those individuals. So therefore, with some of the explanations that we have already shared, you can in that sense provide some support. I see. With any of the extraterrestrials who find the excitement of meeting him as great as he talks about meeting the extraterrestrials, I mean, this is good, but perhaps a very particular understanding of timing will differ from him. And there is some particular shall we say a right game plan, which calls for a particular timing, which may not be shall we say that soon, but as soon as five of your years. I understand. One evening he and I fixed the thought into a quartz crystal into one of the fastest. He projected a thought, the both of us into it, as to a very loving, wonderful first meeting with the extraterrestrials. And what form does it take? The form of two people who really like each other trying to delve into possibly crystal technology that we don't fully understand, but we do understand that the power of our mind is the most important thing. And so we fixed that thought into one of the facets of this crystal. It's not a question. It's more or less a statement. Oh, thank you. This is what our belief is. There is shall we say some valid physical explanation for that as well. What you are doing is quite possible, but what we have learned is your validating of your imagination and following what that tool had provided to do. Congratulations. Thank you. That's all for now. And to you. Any more final questions? You want? And I want you to turn on the final and talk a bit. Can you describe in detail what our cities on our planet will look like as opposed to the now- present moment and also can you describe what type of earth is the most important thing to do. And also can you describe what type of earth transportation will be available to us compared to the present systems used on earth to set from one place to another. Now, you do know that it is not our particular perspective and orientation to predict, however, we will share with that what you will find in terms of your city is what you call more extreme wine buildings. The idea of smoother surfaces, different materials, many of your older buildings will come down, new ones will go up. However, in terms of your transportation, perhaps one of the more initial linking will be the technology that you now label. One more. Magna-leb, which is a type of magnetic levitation, it is a style of train, which is, shall we say, in prototype on your planet at this time. We see far more of the utilization of this idea and eventually as there is encouragement to no longer squelt or squashed alternative sources of energy, there will be in mass the discovery of the particular methodologies to tap the electromagnetics. That the electromagnetics field of your planet itself and much of the transportation will take place along these lines, electromagnetics in origin rather than a mechanical way you have created up so now. And this, of course, will yield no side effects, no pollution. You will find that many of the technologies that develop will begin to honor the planet you live upon and not simply continue to dirty it up. Now, when you say that the cities will be streamlined and the old buildings will come down, to some degree, there will, shall we say, for quite some time, still be a representation of the older style of architecture. Let's see. My other question is, in fourth density, do various extraterrestrial civilizations have equal advancements of the same technology on a planet? Sometimes, sometimes, completely different, it will depend on one of the reasons that individual consciousness is choose to create many different civilizations. So that there is a variety of choices in how to express. May I now say that one of the methodologies that you use upon your planet, even though you think it's so obvious, there's actually somewhat rare throughout the universe. That is your radio waves. That is why it is most unlikely for you to hear an answer to your radio wave transmissions, your search for extraterrestrial intelligence. For many of the civilizations who are in close enough proximity to you, who have utilized that symbol, have certainly simply not utilized it in many hundreds of years. So therefore, your periods, your windows of that technology are overlapping and therefore it is unlikely that you will hear in this way. As we have said, it is far more efficient from our perspective to communicate directly through biological transceivers such as this. If we remove, shall we say, many of the moving parts? Okay. Yes. Okay, NASA has plans to use a nuclear fuel rocket. Recently, they've mentioned it in our Earth News, which will, they say, be safer and more efficient than using the chemical fuel used by NASA now currently on a space mission. So what kind of fuels do you rely on to travel and our experience with nuclear has not been as safe as one thing? Our particular perspective is that it is not our preference to that particular style of development. Now, we allow it, we are not interfering with the little simply allow you to proceed, but there are many by products, which are either being minimized or simply not mentioned that occur, but if these projectiles are fired from your planet, so there is not some speculation of only incorporating them once in space, perhaps that will minimize that particular style of pollution. But understand, we do not use fuel in the way that you mean we have learned to harness the electromagnetic field of our planet itself, that gets us so to seek up and running, at which point we are then able to utilize what would translate, there will be a bit more all encompassing than your word for life in order to travel itself. But we mean valuing and wider frequency bandwidth than that you consider flight. And finally, I heard that before. What Tom was saying actually, about the, you talked about the payment as opposed to abduction, at least from my... How does it usually imply don't bring them back? Well, I know, I know it used well. I used the term abduction in terms of the differences in conduct. I used the term disdain, more as an understanding of how you defined it. That will also be a judgment by individuals who would enter into such an agreement on a higher self level, have chosen to impose a forgetfulness of the agreement in this life. Therefore, when they think something is happening to them, it feels like they are being abducted. When they simply understand that perhaps they do not remember why, but they have made an agreement and begin to look at why the nature of the agreement changes, the nature of the interaction between human and the beings themselves change, and therefore they no longer labeled on that way. I understand. I validate to myself, as Tom was talking, that I don't really think that I have ever, in my being since my birth, have ever been detained by anyone from anywhere. In the classic sense that you mean, perhaps you can say you have not, but you have in your sleeping dream reality interacting with the stream we have formally discussed as clear as you should. Right, sadly, do you understand? And many times, because of their similar appearance to your human appearance, you simply assume that you are dreaming of other humans. I say, I say that. In 1999, it has been said that there is a possibility that we will have a small nuclear skirmish or a nuclear weapon in the Middle East will be shot towards New York City and that New York City will disappear, and also not because of just that nuclear weapon, but also because of natural occurrences. By the way, it is at least an instance that is not our perspective, so a lot of appreciate that. Okay. All right. I didn't validate that as being something I felt was going to happen either. It is simply one prediction, one sense of the energy, perhaps with some fear of the vacuum. This confederation, the interplanetary confederation, incidentally, in general, what you are seeking of is the same as what we refer to as the Association of Worlds. Oh, okay. We simply prefer the terminology association for this far less hierarchical and more of a sharing, networking body. I understand. Well, then the association of the world has a shift that is 100 miles long and 50 stories high in earth terms above this woman's property. Extra dimensional craft that I've somewhat elaborated to. Yes, but from our perspective, that would not be a craft representative of the entire association, but one particular string. Right. Evan. Evan is most unlikely to be perceived from anyone but that individual. Right. I understand. She hasn't perceived the craft yet for my talking with her. How does she know it's there? Well, they've told her. Oh. The thing is, they said last night that there will be a time that's a cross on her property. And she had mentioned, they had mentioned to her that there will be a time when there will be a miracle that will happen. I'm not sure how to explain this, but that once that happens, they have pods or pod craft that will come down. They will land within the area of the vortexes and there will be a spiral of energy that will be able to beam people up to their craft. Oh. Could you elaborate on this? We are not in direct communication with that particular string. Therefore, we will simply take your word for it. Okay, that's the last thing. That's it. The final, the final. We thank you. Hey. Hey. Hey. I'm excited about getting back to being a cowboy. Oh, all right. All right. I have a question about this. Oh, boy. Okay. Actually, I'm even more excited about getting ahead to being a cowboy. I want to be a space cowboy. How best to facilitate that? Any suggestions and will the zetas be instrumental? Our particular suggestion would be to be an Earth cowboy to get some questions. Then simply wherever you go, you will be literally being a cowboy. It was a good one. I'm excited about joining from planet to planet and dimensions to dimensions. Oh, well, then simply enjoy this life, perhaps the next and future life will bring that to you. Thank you. Do not thank me. Thank yourself. Is that all? Yeah, I guess everything else I can figure out myself. Oh, what? Oh, well, yeah. So, I'd like to get back to talking about dreams and specifically concepts which can be at primary dreams and applied to this dream city. I had a rather distributed dream about a week and a half ago in which my brother wanted to force separate murders. They had a poster board with not pictures of people's in murder, but symbols representing those people. As the dream progressed, the dream got that investigations and news murders turned out that my brother had also murdered our mother. No one seems to have known that at the time. And I was remembering in the dream, seeing my mother on a gurney or mortuary lab with her neck blast. Look, there are only three or four times that I remembered taking in the dream. I can't believe these people could pick up on something unnatural had happened. I'm wondering what kind of concept I'm supposed to be bringing back to the forest in that particular scenario. Was there a particular way under the circumstances that you now wish to relate to your brother or perhaps something you wish you had related to him prior to the commission of these ideas? Um, no, I don't think so. Well, look at that. And if there is a communication, make it now. But one of the reference in this particular instance would have to do with what you label path-wise scenario, whereby you were in similar relationships and something as that physically did occur. Therefore, you were touching back on that particular shall we say occur, but what we are now suggesting is that if there are some communication that you had felt to make or that you now feel to make, make them. Midwife it into this reality by communicating with that individual in some way that would be beneficial to this life. That doesn't make sense because his birthday was recently and I just sent him a card. So I guess I've solved it for myself. But you have taken the steps and you have in that sense weeks or bridge one thing to the next. Yeah. Were for instance an individual to have a dream? That someone in that sense to utilize a particular example were ignoring you, walking away from you, and you wake up and cannot figure out how to reconcile with this individual. Perhaps you can understand that the message is that you do not wish to be treated that way. Therefore, you can now begin to apply that in this life by being willing to treat others with the respect you felt you deserve. That is taking something and making it into a positive application in this dream. Losa. Yes, very much. We thank you. One of the things we talked a little bit earlier about Carmen's balance. Hey. And I'm one of my grandmother's I about two and a half years ago. And she lived a difficult life because she was a very bitter woman in this life. And I'm wondering one thing, how she's doing now and why do people sometimes live up to the lives? She can experience or the part of Carmen's balance is being done, trapped, and other people with different variations. A lot of people first explain that what you call karma is not a law, but it is an agreement. Perhaps you can say the law is what you put out is what you get back. But retribution style karma is self-imposed. That is what individuals feel. They deserve, and that is the way they feel. They deserve it. So they create that continuity life to us if what they buy into is retribution and they create an eye for an eye. But one of the things you had explained earlier is that balance can be maintained and established in different ways, not necessarily hit or tap, as you say. In her particular instance, there was the playing out of a particular balance. There was certain recognition, but upon passing, as you say, shall we say her eyes, so to speak, are a bit more open. Our perception is that she has now been quite accurately and appropriately oriented in she's back to thinking of style of reality, and is choosing to act at least for the time being as guide, spirit guide for certain individuals still physical. There are for many of the questions you are asking you to simply ask her directly. But in general when individuals impose karma upon themselves, they do it through a series of unconscious beliefs, not necessarily that they wish these things upon themselves consciously. We think about the fact that when you create a reality, you do so consciously, and the other method is unconsciously. The unconscious creation, things you bought into perhaps on faith of someone else's word or societal notions, are the things that generally result in the unpreterrential things that are in the way that you do that in by allowing yourself to become aware of what you already believe. Once you even acknowledge that you had a belief which you bought into unconsciously, the acknowledgement of the belief now makes it conscious. Then it's a choice to continue to live that belief, or to be able to do that. When you acknowledge when of the belief now makes it conscious, then it's a choice to continue to live that belief, or to choose and change beliefs as we have discussed earlier, drumming up the emotion, the thoughts and the corresponding actions, and acting the way you say you believe. So therefore the karma of envy, when imposing that way, the result of unconscious beliefs and tendencies, is it clear? Yes, yes, thank you. And to you, therefore, before you go to sleep this night, if you wish, invite interaction. Grant yourself the permission to remember it upon waiting, and see what happens. I'll do that. Thank you. Shit. Hello. Hey. Hello to you. And to you. Hi, too. Hi. I was wondering, I read in a book called Cosmic Viewpoint that before the 25,000 year cycle, year cycle, there were civilizations that used small spacecraft for personal travel. In a sense, you can understand that avalanches add such flying machines. Also, in the beginning of the session, you said that life doesn't happen to you, it happens through you. Can you also say it happens from you? Oh, okay. And again, similarly, you are not on a tap. You are. Right. And cannot be off of yourself. Also, I was reading in a grant book from 1988 that May is considered a highly... Highly excited for the wrong word, but a month... May is considered a month that has a lot of energy towards the transition. Well, this is rather arbitrary in a sense, where you can understand in falling in your spring time that it does symbolize many rebirth, many awakening. Okay. One other question. In photography, people... is there any significance to the fact that some people, always... When people take pictures of them, they always look odd. They don't look like themselves. And other people always look like these dogs. Yes, that will depend on their particular relationship with the land. If they, in a sense, make a big to do about it, very often they will look awkward. If they simply go about their business and allow that, I can catch them in the doing of the things and the living of the life. In general, it looks more natural. Thank you. And I did want to share with you that I listened to the tape of the session where you explained about inserting yourself in your past. And I understand it completely clearly. Do you need retroactive reconstruction? Well, whereby you create the amount of time it would take to have a particular manifestation and simply then project back in your imagination that number of years will start to profit back then. No, that's not what I'm... Oh, that's very interesting. Oh, that's very interesting. Yeah, that's very interesting. Well, I was referring to the discussion about the human search yourself in the past. You mean you all have to turn it on live. And you understand? I understand. I understand it. I understand it. I understand it. I understand it. I understand it. I understand it. That's very interesting. There was some difficulty in rendering the explanation. It was perfect. It was perfect. But what was that? You just said that was perfect. How about it? Something else? You already only ever exist right here, right now. Any ideas that you create in any now moment of the future of the past are recreating the past, projecting the future in the present. They have no inherent weight other than what you assign them. And very often individuals will use what they perceive to be negative things in their past as an excuse in the present to not do the things they wish for back then they always have this or that. Our point is that back then, your relationship to back then, is defined entirely by you. The present is not experientially a result of the past, only to the degree that an individual assigns it. Therefore in knowing this, you can now get a bit creative. You can assign any past you wish when you imagine a past and run it through your mind, run it through your mind. It has literally as much substance as any recreated memory, which again was only an interpretation at that time, and not necessarily an accurate representation of what occurred. So if for instance there is a particular end goal that you have, that you feel would take you perhaps seven years to accomplish, simply go back seven years in your imagination, picture the you seven years ago, beginning that process. So you now have the rationale to be that you right now. And that memory is just as real as any other recreated memory if you assign as much weight to it as you assign to the other interpreting. Great, that's great. Oh we think so. Thank you very much. Hello, can you accelerate the process? For instance, if you choose to be a doctor, take seven years. Only if you truly believe it. You truly believe it. You end up with a license and force certification. If you truly believe it, no doubt whatsoever, which perhaps within your definition of reality is unlikely. How do you tell always finding needs? I'm just always testing limits on how malleable this perceived reality is. Oh thank you. But in terms of being socially confident and being able to do public speaking of the like, perfect example of one that will work quite well. Yes, and you can imagine what kind of a past you would have had to have. You don't have to give very details, I would think. You'd be tough to you. And you certainly don't need to take seven years to give yourself a seven years of experience. It can be done in a moment of time. Is that nice? Absolutely correct. Great fun, thank you. Oh thank you. Shh. And on. Oh, two, three or four weeks ago my daughter had exciting the spacecraft in an area outside our house that I have found. I have felt for several years now that there has been some activity. I wonder if you could give me any information about that. Not really. That will be directly accessed by her. However, we shall say that her Nikki opened a door within her. And you may find now that her interest is heightened that it will give you the opportunity to interact with what you already know, rather than forcing it upon her, perhaps she will participate more readily in the process. That would be very nice. When she is willing to take some bold steps and speak to us after having looked at this and made certain conclusions, then we can go further. In terms of spoon feeding it to her, it's simply not our job to do so. Of course not. But you have no information about who they were. At this time, or the labeling of it would be the narrowing of her point of view. And the most expanded opening point of view will be the most conducive for receiving information. Would you be able to tell me if I also had contact in my sleeping dream of these people? Absolutely. No, okay. The same is true. Thank you. Absolutely. Sure. Thank you. I wonder if you could elaborate a little bit on what your fascination and what your discovery was in your swimming on your part. Since they've been similar to your own. When individuals realizing that they could, in that sense, float upon the water, propel themselves with their body, simply enjoy interfacing with that thicker portion of our atmosphere for that is how we view it. Therefore, it's simply in a sense for us to form a flying, you will. And also we are, because the animal consciousness upon any planet is a reflection of the sentient thinking consciousness Our animals are not territorial like yours. They are not our never-as-like yours. They do not attack each other like yours. Therefore, there was in the reveling in the sea, if you will, also a communion with many other forms of life here to for unavailable. Also, one of the similar, shall we say, explorations in our ancient past. As yours is what you would loosely label sailboats. We revel in harnessing the power of the wind of the planet itself to sail upon the water. Very interesting. I have tried something called drifts, Norquin, where if you go in the water with the direction of the current, you can go many miles at a very slow pace with the current, watching the coral and things on the bottom. Have you ever done that? We have, shall we say, not as much current as you, for our planet has no moves. Therefore, we have no time. However, there is an animal in our water that would look similar when poking his head above water, in a sense, to what you might loosely label. The closest analogy would be branphosaurus-like. This particular animal will gain momentum in swimming, and an individual with so inclined can be seen. Can participate in the following way. The force of that animal moving through the water creates behind its neck a wake. And that wake behind its neck, if an individual boldly will, the person will get it, will give them quite a while. Therefore, this is one of our joints. Well, thank you for sharing that with us. I'll let you go on. You should have. You have no time, then you have no waves, so you don't surf on your planet? In the sense that you mean no. But perhaps you can say, in a sense, that our ships can sort of see, skip along the electromagnetic flows and currents of our planet. So in a sense, we can play around in that way. What I see is this fascination with interplanetary travel, three whites spread on your planet. Shall we say, for the recorders of the population, is very interested in it, so perhaps you can then say yes. How far in the teacher would it be for us to have this type of exploration? That will depend on many decisions now being made. There are probabilities, depending again upon the form of your transformation, that it can be as soon as 30 to 50 of your years to begin to spread out a bit. Very exciting. Thank you. We welcome you in this fight. So I need not wait exactly two more lifetimes. In order to have the ship that you have shared approximately along your timeline approximately. Thank you. A bit of will be time for but a few more. Shall we? Shall we? We have something surrounding this planet called the Old Zone. It seems to be destroyed now. It is quite a bit of destroyed. By the way, it is not destroyed. What shall we say has a bit of a hole. Okay. Well, it starts to be quite a thing for the many ways that we should repair the hole. Well, first of all, your planet will do that just fine. Where are you to stop boring the hole? Well, how can we accelerate that through the planet? Well, most obviously on your local levels allow your voice to be heard, and whatever way excites you in whatever media that you can communicate with allow your officials to know in no uncertain terms that you view yourselves as equal to them. You are not chiding or berating them, but what you wish is the immediate, immediate sensation of all of the materials in which contribute to the breaking down of this idea. Okay. Is there anything else that we can do to balance? Well, if you wish in your medications, you can picture your planet as being surrounded by a blue-white bubble. That can assist on a theory levels as well. Okay. Thank you very much. And you understand that to some degree, there is a positive symbology behind that opening as well, for it is analogous to the opening of the crown chakra of each and every individual. So therefore, there are also positive interpretations, though again, the tendency would be to perhaps allow that to repair itself so that you can still get them done. Thank you. Hey. There are some who see a different meaning in that, but whether it exists or not or what it's being missed. Would the whole being there be a reflection of mass consciousness and is there still an allowance that it may not be there for those who don't choose to see it in that perspective? In a sense, you can understand what you would wag to be the whole, and again, we are being quite colloquial. There is no literal whole, but perhaps a thinning in a certain area. To be a mass consciousness agreement, and again, you can only deviate from that agreement, but whether or not other individuals will believe you are not. It's not the matter. So we get to this problem. Does that happen? Yes, sir. Okay. Is it necessary that this whole view prepared for our continued exploration, or is it not possible that this whole allows more radiations to come down on the planet, and we ourselves are going through a physiological transformation? Both. Thank you very much. Both probabilities are present. But understand, there will be physiological changes, and your decision in that sense to adapt can also have physiological changes, thereby now enabling you to utilize that very radiation. In any case, no need to worry. To the view would be our suggestion that we do not. Thank you. But then again, still take whatever actions are reflective of your not being willing to contribute to what you perceive to be that problem. Thank you. Thank you. Anthony. Hey, uh, the thing that on the whole, um, one of my understandings, and understandings are that the whole is a way for increased white, white rays of energy of the transformational energy to come through the whole to fill out throughout the planet itself. Then that would be a positive interpretation. Yes. And that is one way individuals may utilize it. Yes, that's the way I interpret the whole. Um, I was going to ask you about the plating woman in which I have, uh... Anaya. Yes, Anaya. Uh, I had talked to her last night. Actually, externally, not internally this time. Uh, and, uh, I was very, I felt very strong emotions, almost disappointed tears of joy. And, um... Yes. And I have never felt that way for quite some time. Can't say that anymore. Uh, I felt somewhat as enjoyed, sad does not have to be a negative thing to have to be sad when someone goes away. I like correct? Well, the idea is that you have such a direct mental communication. You never need the address. Um, I, uh, I just felt so wonderful in terms of, I just felt such an emotional feeling, which since, yesterday, I've probably gotten over that feeling, and then I don't think you ever get over it. Well, the answer is not something you wish to get over. Right. And simply revel when you feel it. Right. Move on and be involved with what is in front of you and you do not. Well, there will be a time when we can physically meet each other. That will be up to particular decisions that you make it as possible. Mm-hmm. And again, when we suggested utilizing the symbol of an external meeting, we did not necessarily mean you would walk out into a field and find a shift. We met in your imagination, you can picture yourself walking out into a field, a shift landing someone coming out, and carrying on the conversation using that involvement. Right. That will increase the chances. Right. Now, using that involvement, that's one alternative method of that communications. Right. It's up to you. Right. But you can also utilize the telephone analogy we recently used. Tell me. If we in your imagination see the telephone ring, go over, pick it up, say hello, be not. Please add the two what comes on the other end. I have, who have had contacts with various pallidians that have been their old friends, have not had to go through the alternative method of... Some have, some have not. There have not been that many physical interactions for us, but it has to be. If I had only decided, one of my own being, answering to myself that I, as a choice, a free choice of choices. May I make a suggestion? Yes. Put out the invitation. Do so in a way where you have a general expectancy of a response. Right. Do not have a rigid expectation that it must occur in this way. Whether you do, you do not allow yourself to see many of the other joyful ways that you can interact. Therefore, if you have it as a premise, keep it as a clear intention. Put it out to the universe, to the phleating, if you wish to be more specific. And then go about your business without dictating that it must come physically. So, you may find a particular joy in the initial stages. Any individual who has had a physical contact in that way, pre-plan, has always, firstly, communications in order. That's how they need where to go. Okay. So, you're willing to begin to nurture that relationship. We'll give you the opportunity to know if it is to be physical, where to go, if it is not, and we'll understand why. Right. Now I do understand. Okay. And I thank you. And you as well. Yolan. Hey. It's Kenny's mom Dorothy and each here, if it's a beautiful thing. Perhaps you can say there are some origins in that direction. But then again, none of you is negative to this planet anywhere. Remember you are eternal beings. Therefore, you have many, many connections. Or she appears to be an exceptionally nurturing individual. Oh, well that is not, shall we say, rare upon your planet? It's rare in my experience that a mother has been so accepting of the individuality that her children are, and so supportive of their developing and expressing themselves in a way that's unique to them. Not invalidating, not questioning, never demeaning, but really supporting her children. In this way you can understand that he has chosen one. Yeah. Thank you very much. And to you. At this time allow us to once again remind you that you are aspect of the infinite. That is your title. You are part of the white, of the white light from all that is itself. What breaks down that white light in a way that makes you unique is the prism that comprises the artificial person and the artificial personality construct that you are. That prism is composed of belief, emotion, and thoughts. Therefore, whenever you wish to change the expression of that white light for you, all you need to do is change any one of those three features. You will find it most easy to change the belief first, for that is shall we say on this plane the cause of causes. But your willingness to change any aspect of the triad of prism that you are will change the vibration that you are. We'll now represent a different manifestation of that white light of infinite creation and allow you to express yourself consciously, according to preference, as an aspect of the infinite. Multigimensional, infinite, and eternal are you all. Therefore, we express to you our unconditional love and appreciation for sharing a bit of that eternal and infinite net with us. And will you aim a most fond and loving, good evening.
