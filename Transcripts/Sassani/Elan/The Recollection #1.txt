 Greetings this evening of your time as you create time how are you all? Oh thank you very much. We will begin this interaction this evening of your time with the entitlement, the recollection, and shall we say this will pertain to what we will label your creation of time for understand. You are infinite, eternal and multi-dimensional beings and this means in the truest sense of the word eternal that you have no beginning. You have no therefore middle or ending in the overall sense of your being however. Within that infinity, within that totality there are many diverse ways that you express your beingness and one of those ways. Just one is in this particular reality you call the physical reality within which there is shall we say to some degree an agreement between beings to create the notion of the unfoldment of the forgetting and subsequent remembering of before, during and after. And this in a sense again is agreed upon by all individuals in a reality in terms of synchronizing that creation according to a certain rate, according to a certain timing. Now you as a society are in that sense agreeing to be synchronized in time stream so with shall we say minor individual variations you generally as a society experience time in a similar fashion. Now very often even during your shall we say day to day reality you may in that sense shall we say create time in a slightly different flow perhaps left of it which you then perceive time flies by or perhaps more of it you perceive then that time is dragging along. But it is your creation and there is the standardization to some degree between all individuals within a given mass consciousness in a society. Our particular society is also to some degree synchronized to itself in that we still to some degree create time. Our relationship to that time and our experience of that time is far different. However we still do create it and there still is a rate or a flow at which we synchronize with each other for some degree of a common experience. We have spoken to your society many times about the fact that we exist in a different dimension of experience and that this is why you would not at this time physically perceive our star without shall we say a few adjustments in that dimension. What we have not often shared is one of shall we say the nature or the nature of that difference in dimensionality and although this to some degree will have particular extensions into our physicality which we will not discuss at this time. One of the shall we say more obvious differences that in a sense has us existing in a different dimension that is not synchronized to yours and therefore in that sense does not allow us to physically perceive each other without the adjustments is the fact that our particular stream of time in shall we say reference to your own in comparison to your own is approximately and this is again quite arbitrary quite approximate but ten times faster than your own. What you perceive to be in that sense thirty years of the passage of your time would translate into our history to approximately three hundred years of time. So therefore without a synchronization there simply would be no sense to be made from one dimension of experience to another such as the difference in the experience and creation of time itself. When we in that sense interact with you we do so from our particular relative stream of time so it may seem to us that simply days have passed but in a sense it is synchronized when we interact with you to your time stream as to seem to make some type of sense to you and to seem to have some continuity in that sense from one interaction to another but it is not necessarily the one to one relationship that you might imagine. For instance you will perceive many times that we have had for instance four or five particular discrete interactions but from my end we may in that sense perceive them as one shall we say interaction. So there will not always be a one to one correspondence though we can tap into where and when our communications are coming through to you and make some kind of logistical sense to it in your terms before during and after other sessions. So therefore again even this is quite an arbitrary creation but allow us to move on to your creation of time. We will use the following analogy. You have what you call to be a theory. You call your big bang and what this represents from our perspective is the intersection of shall we say consciousness itself which is transcendental and physical reality itself. That intersection the point at which they meet so to speak creates a spark and in that sense initially speaking that spark will be perceived in a particular given space of physical reality as initially nothing and then perhaps you can say something but one something. Now again this is all quite colloquial and it's more for the purposes of analogy than direct precise information but simply follow along and you will understand the analogy. First of all again allow us to extend the definition that even your society even your physicists shall we say are understanding that space and time formally believed to be two discrete ideas are simply two sides of the same coin and even in your science is now labeled space time rather than simply each individual component. Understand that this makes sense for in order or shall we say with the creation of space then comes the necessity of time so to speak to transverse it to be able to make some sense out of it and this is one of the shall we say presentations that time itself will represent. So following on the analogy of a singular point at that singular point at the time shall we say of its manifestation there is no time for there is simply one point there is no shall we say space to cover no where to go nothing to do so therefore there is not the need for the creation of time to do it in but when in that sense at one point does in a sense again as an analogy explode out to shall we say many billions and billions of separate ideas shall we say radiating out 360 degrees in all directions you then from that sense or next from that singular point begin to create between that singular point and the point of dispersion space space from a point to another point and as in that sense you create more space also is simultaneously the creation of time itself again perhaps colloquially speaking you can say time in which to traverse the space itself obviously if everything is all one idea there is again no necessity for time but the moment there is a single separation the moment there is a single divergence from a single point there is then the necessity within realities that contain this idea of time is this clear so far now understand as you separate from the one in the aforementioned analogy you create more space and you create more time and you also then by definition create more separation therefore allow us to now shall we say bring this analogy home so to speak we have discussed with you many times the idea of limitation separation and also of limitlessness and integration in that sense were you using the again a four mentioned analogy of big bang to begin to contract the points back to the center you would then correspondingly create less space so to speak between the points and therefore less time necessary to shall we say extend to each point this will directly relate to your life to your personal shall we say experience for as you are exploring separation limitation you are in that sense creating more space the more separations you create from who you choose to be the more time in that sense you then need create to experience those separations to experience each discrete idea as a separate idea so therefore as you embark upon your reality from the perspective of separation and limitation you automatically create more time to do so therefore you always have shall we say colloquially speaking enough time to explore each and every minute corner of each and every minute separation that you have created now this works in the inverse way or the opposite way as well for as you begin to represent who you are and understand that you create your reality one hundred percent one hundred percent what that one hundred percent means is that everything in that reality one hundred percent of everything fits one hundred percent of everything is your creation as you begin to act upon this knowledge in the way that you begin to use these creations you integrate them one at a time and in the integration it is as if again the many points are contracting back to the center point the more you allow everything in your reality to deliver the message in a positive way that you have created it to deliver the left time you then need to create so therefore remembering that these creations were made by you perhaps from unconscious beliefs in your past before you knew you had a choice before you knew you could consciously choose your beliefs there may be some shall we say you sometimes refer to it as extra baggage to in that sense incorporate it seems like extra baggage but the idea is that it is not that it is part of who you are and that in a sense you can open those suitcases and repack the contents within you which is the taking of the many parts and integrating them back into the home therefore an attitude of separation is an attitude of creating more time to experience those separation an attitude of integration begins in that sense to allow everything to come back to center begins to allow the space between the many fragmentation that you present as your discrete physical personality to decrease thereby again decreasing the time necessary to explore each and every one of them so therefore as you do acknowledge perhaps the creations created unconsciously created from unpreferred beliefs and use them in a positive way use them to nail down the foundational primary belief that still limit you acknowledge those beliefs decide after acknowledging and appreciating what they have allowed you to do and serve you to choose the new preferred belief acting as though you already have the new preferred belief you integrate the separations one at a time you integrate the space in the totality of your consciousness that then it's that the face time in that sense to experience it and as you begin to own your reality acknowledge your reality express gratitude for the creations that you had formerly labeled negative but obviously that also contain the jewels of positivity and self reflection you begin to literally change the rate of your creation of time in perhaps what you can say relative terms to the creation of time of your society as a whole and sometimes again to use the analogy you simply then begin to perceive that time is flying by quite quickly but again we remind you when you say time has flown by for I have had a good time it is not truly that time has passed any faster in fact because in having a good time quote unquote you are being fully who you are you are expressing less of the separation and therefore in that integrated state of awareness literally creating less time so if one or two hours has passed by your mass consciousness clock time and you have seen to experience only 20 or 25 minutes your body and your consciousness so to speak mentality have only aged the 25 or 13 minutes so therefore obviously you can see that this would have far reaching effect on your physical body itself this is why your life spans beginning to increase when you begin to honor and validate who you are by beginning to grant the validity to the things with integrity that move you that give you passion that excite you for they are representative of who you are they are representative of your willingness to act as an integrated whole rather than separate parts collecting each and every part back together which can take a long time do not worry you will make all the time you need to do so but what we are suggesting is that should you wish to experience to create time at a flow that represents your integration your physical age your physical life span will increase and understand now that even if you are to define that your physical life span is 100 of your years from our particular understanding of your physiognomy this is but one third of the potential of the life spans of the body that you create for 300 years is in and of itself the possible shall we say amount of time that your bodies can live and your shall we say reaching but one third of that is a direct result of your style of creation of time if you are sending shall we say a majority of that one third of the time in misery in self-denial of your creations you seem in that sense to create shall we say the two or three hundred years worth of the passage of time but in a sense because that is not synchronized to your particular society you seem in that sense shall we say to only have lived the hundred years or perhaps quite a bit less in some instances but understand that this is all there is to it and your willingness to stop denying your creations as why is this happening to me poor me what will I do what did I ever do to deserve that miserable thing that is a perspective that is an approach that is an attitude now in a sense we are making light of it in order in that sense to allow you to enjoy these interactions understand that we are not criticizing it when we do so but simply sometimes members of your society seem in that sense to appreciate that particular approach of hearing perhaps you can say how it sounds from a third person's point of view but we are not making fun of you and we are not saying that what you are doing is any worse qualitatively than what we are suggesting but simply having some fun in the course of communicating these ideas to you but understand that when you do that you remove your ability to use your creation for if you deny it why is this happening to me you are not looking at it as your creation and then cannot treat it and transform it as your creation you approach it as an external idea when you simply understand well all right all right all right here is the creation that I have created but it is not one that I prefer so therefore I am not looking at it as my creation where I can simply assume that because I created all this is not the one exception were I to assume that this is my creation I would understand that anything I create no matter how it looks contains both potentials for positive and negative manifestation so therefore since I know I created it and I know on some level as I create levels what I am doing I will simply approach it from the perspective how does it serve me the way that it is presenting not if it was this if it was that but exactly the way it is when you do that when you simply shift your perspective one minute bit to this particular perspective you then give yourself shall we say one of the only chances to integrate it rather than deny it denial is continued separation denial is the pushing our partitioning of parts within you acknowledgement acting from the acknowledgement is integration itself it is the glue of unconditional love within you that allows you to collect back what you have formerly labeled separations within you allows you to recollect yourself into a discrete singular being with a singular integrated presentation and experience therefore what we are sharing with you as the recollection is on the one hand the recollection of this information that we are sharing which you already know on some level or you would simply not understand a word that I am saying but also the literal literal recollection or re-collection of what you have denied within you when you talk about a subconscious closet not the subconscious shall we say portion of your consciousness that allows for the automatic shall we say pilot of your body and so forth but the closet that you stuff things into so to speak what allows the stuffing and feeling of this closet is denial itself when you deny something it does not go away for again you are all of creation there is nowhere to hide it there is nowhere to put it there is no outside so you talk it so to speak again globally into a closet you call the subconscious shall we say portion of your subconscious that is as a closet or perhaps a dungeon but understand you can smash the lock from that dungeon you can throw open that dungeon door and one at a time acknowledge your creations but not from the perspective of why me but from the perspective of all right I now understand that this is a creation that resulted from an unconscious belief that I no longer prefer but I wish to acknowledge it I wish to see what the belief is because I know I cannot change it unless I first see it unless I first own it so calling forth shall we say members of the dungeon allows shall we say things to come to the surface so that you may now reinterpret them in an integrative way now perhaps at first perhaps at first it may seem a little overwhelming if you shall we say open the door all the way so therefore feel free if you wish to use the analogy of a door to simply crack it and at least allow things a bit at a time to seek out if you deny those things worry not they will be put back in the closet and you will get a chance to look at them later but if in that sense you acknowledge them you will slowly empty out the closet and perhaps eventually shut it down but it is up to you the creations you stuff back in the closet however have a particular tendency that you in your particular perspective label disturbing that particular tendency is the harder and farther you push them into the closet because they are your creations because they are part of you because you cannot truly deny anything about yourself the louder they will knock the more they will rattle their chains the more they will bang on the walls and the more in that sense you will be aware of them so your willingness to simply invite them one by one as your children rather than your prisoners will enable you to see why you created these children how they serve you what it is they allow you to discover about yourself that you can use and transform yourself in a positive way and we remind you there is absolutely nothing unless your definition says that there is there is absolutely nothing that you can find out about yourself no matter as you say how awful that you cannot use in a positive way are you willing to approach it from that perspective you can use it in a positive way so there is no need to fear anything in the closet from the perspective of using it from the perspective of its negative interpretation we understand the fear and entrepidation but from the perspective of what it has to offer this is a different perspective and this is what allows the symbols to deliver a message that you can use in a positive way when you call forth an idea from your subconscious closet acknowledge it appreciate it it may be outdated it may be obsolete but appreciate that it has led you to this point and choose anew with eyes open having equalize it it does not go back into the closet it integrates into your totality it becomes a part of you that is no better or no worse it has no less or more weight than anything else but because you are choosing a positive perspective the negative aspects of it will simply be irrelevant remember you contain it all and if you are creating a reality as you are of positive and negative you contain all of both so it is not a matter of ever escaping the negative it is part of you for it is a polarized expression of the reality itself but when you choose as an intention a positive perspective that negativity becomes irrelevant to the experience of your life so awareness of it you may have but you will never experience one drop of the negativity your awareness of the negativity because you are again in a world that contains that negativity will come in the form of the awareness of quote unquote negative things quote unquote happening to other individuals and from your perspective you will understand that that is not negative that is happening to them but you will understand that they are interpreting it as negative therefore creating the negative experience therefore you will perhaps again still perceive negativity but not experience it at all and again in that particular vein we remind you you can think anything you wish it is not the thinking of something positive which gives a positive reality it is not the thinking of something negative which gives a negative reality the thinking shall we say strata of your being is simply the library and in that sense you can read any book you wish scary happy angry sad miserable ecstatic you can read them all but the ones you check out are the ones that are your life for the ones you check out are the ones that you act on and it is the actions that you take and the books to continue the analogy that you have read at the manual for those actions which determine the reality so if you do not act with the negative perspective you can never did he say never I think he did never get a negative experience only can you experience a negative experience if you first interpreted that way assign that meaning and then act with that interpretation and negative attitude then yes you may experience things that you will find very simple to label negative but it works the other way around and as you begin to use them in a positive way all your creations you also change the rate and flow of your creation of time therefore it's about time that you perhaps began to look and to invite and to embrace anything that you have denied for all these things again are is ideas or symbols within you none of which can destroy you none of which can have any negative effect on you no matter how overwhelmingly negative they seem if you simply choose to assume and maintain the positive perspective we had at the end of the last interaction made a simple suggestion we will repeat it before proceeding through the exchange whenever you are proceeding and find yourself perhaps after deciding to create a life of positivity functioning from seemingly the old negative perspective first of all that's all right you are simply having an attitude you are simply having an interpretation if you stop at that point and do not act you can mull it over as long as you wish our simple simple simple suggestion is that before you act again you can roll this around as much as you want you can cry you can be miserable you can fully explore the negative perspective of this is happening to me but before you act at least from your positive perspective which now exists within you just as well provide one alternative see in your imagination in your specifically aligned tool that you can never lose see the preferred you state the belief of that preferred you feel how it feels not the negative old you but the preferred new you when you feel that feeling then in your imagination and the situation over to the new preferred you see how that new preferred you handles it see what they do see how they act then you have two choices the shall we say automatic negative choice but also now having emotionally reattached and resumined up your referential preferential you two sets of actions and we suggest that are you to lie both these sets of actions down on the table you will perhaps every time have no difficulty choosing the actions of the preferred you so obvious will it be that those actions are more representative of who you choose to be and you get to be who you choose to be if you say so one of the only things that allows you to do this that allows you to maintain enough of a centered frame of mind to do so is your willing that when an old tendency seems to come along rather than saying there I go again oh I could fail all my metaphysical training down the drain you can simply substitute these two words so what so what here is one idea it is not an idea that I prefer therefore I need not judge myself for having come up with it presenting as many options as I will give me that many more choices so what I thought that as you say big deal now I will summon the referential preferential need I will now see how that may would act I will lay them side by side if the miserable alternative looks more appealing I can still do it I haven't lost it but now I will be acting as a creator and have used the fact that I had that tendency quote unquote to my advantage when we say use your creations we mean them all and this will also be your creation of self invalidation and judgment for that paralyzes you that nips your ability in the blood so to speak to do anything about it but the moment you simply instead of saying oh dumb me say so what is this what I intend to do is this representative of who I am now no it will be obvious to you that that has been of service to you by simply reminding you and no uncertain terms who you prefer to be perhaps by giving you an example of who you do not prefer to be but that is one way to do it and you can use that as well therefore in recollecting the many separations within you that you have created in the form of denial have a good time for you literally can start right now to have a good time rather than assuming that when you do this this in that you will be where you wish to be which set up the time by separating that idea from where you are right here right now you can simply be that right now one unit no space therefore not the necessity for time understand when you exist you exist right now and never was there a moment in your life when you would not or could not say it is right now that one moment in a sense is the spark itself as you begin to speak about a past having a hold on the present that is a separation and the further back that separation is in your estimation the more time you need to create in order to walk all those steps so therefore the present need not be considered a result of the past in an experiential way the moment you let go of the separation of the past which you recreate in the present the moment you let go of where you will be which is not where you are a separation from where you are that in and of itself will change your perception of time that in and of itself will seem to accelerate everything to the point where right now is where you experience it you simply need to decide if you wish right now I am who I prefer to be right now and from this point forward simply when something comes up that seems to be a representation of an older unpreferred version of you simply look at some of the things that we have shared for you will find if you do so we don't insist that you do that it will come in handy and you will from this moment forward not become who you wish to be but simply in deciding be be who you wish to be right now which is the only time there is before we proceed to the interaction allow us to share that in your society in your shall we say relative proximity you have had the occurrence of what you have called bad weather and there has been perhaps some destruction though minimal loss of life which is noteworthy of many ideas within that bad weather allow us to share that as you begin to live right here right now and understand that your path has been a recreation from the present of that path and not even generally a precise recreation by the way that as you let go of that past you give yourself the opportunity to be right here right now with no distractions and no self-imposed separation therefore in that this is the transformational age and many many many individuals will begin to see their power will begin to understand that they function from the moment will perhaps in not understanding much of this consciously in many different ways if they are unwilling to do so force themselves to let go of that path therefore you will find in shall we say the rubble so to speak of what has occurred from your weather patterns that there will have been much the quote unquote loss of personal items these personal items are in a sense the museums of the lives of the individuals giving them very strong identifications to their path through certain objects through certain momentos through certain nostalgic material so therefore many individuals simultaneously thousands in fact have again unconsciously chosen in that sense to force themselves through that symbol to literally obliterate their past this in a sense although it can perhaps from the general perspective of your society seem like a bummer will have the overall effect of allowing those individuals to begin anew and the letting go of many of these past ideas which literally bind you is one of the liberating ideas now if you are willing from this point forward which is the only point there is to begin to let go of the path as an excuse consciously you will then not need to force through a symbol yourself to do so therefore if you do now begin to do this and many of you have to a very large degree we are not taking away from that but if you continue to do so you will then not need the symbol to force it upon yourself as shall we say in our perception during the transformation of the next few years perhaps many many more individuals will therefore now that you know the overall reason for the creation of the symbol you can simply get down to it as you say without needing to create the symbol to force you to do so and this is true with everything in your closet for shall we say the loudest knocking of the things that you deny the most that shall we say build up enough momentum to force their way to your conscious awareness very often do so because of your denial because of your cutting off yourself from yourself in the manifestation you call this easy for this easy the symbol which forces you to look at a certain idea or you die therefore many individuals will choose to look at the idea in lieu of dying but you need not to with that way and the more you are willing to acknowledge what you believe within that the less would be any tendency or reason to create this ease for all this is is again not functioning as an aligned whole being and again needless to say when you chop up portions of your conscious awareness and talk them into different compartments this is not integrated therefore it's up to you it always will be and your ability in recollecting this material to recollect yourself out of choice out of preference because you say so because you know you can only grow and learn and because you know when that closet is empty you will be living in ecstatic joy we assume in that sense that this has a certain attraction to you therefore we share it as an option as everything that we share is for we never insist that what we are saying is better than what you are doing but should you choose to find that you are in synchronous alignment with what we are sharing please take it and please use it it is an option and will have the effect that we are sharing should you choose to do it and it's up to you we thank you for your willingness to co-create this interaction with us this evening of your time we thank you for your willingness to open the many doors that you create between sections of your consciousness within your particular reality we thank you for your willingness to interact with us as equals and that equalization is all that is necessary in the gathering of yourself in the recollection of yourself understanding that the concepts that you have denied are equal to all of the concepts then it simply becomes a matter of preference do I prefer it and not a matter of this is better than that and everyone knows that that is separation judgment the unequal assignment of weight is separation validation equal validity and acknowledgement and then perhaps deciding if you prefer it or not but then not invalidating the symbol that you do not prefer is integration is understanding that life does not happen to you it happens through you therefore in return for this willingness we asked you now how may I be of service to you I feel both bold and equal tonight oh thank you and therefore I want you to know that the channel is voiced tonight is noticeably louder than usual well perhaps what you are perceiving is our increased excitement oh yes it shows for we are in that sense very excited about certain transformational tendencies within your planet and within your society though on the surface perhaps individuals aligned to seeing the negative we'll see the remnant bubblings up of the rest of negativity upon your planet which is only now possible because of the mass agreement to not nuclear Lee annihilate yourself it gives individual certain liberties to shall we say do limited military engagements without the fear of global annihilation this is equalizing itself out this is having a homogenizing effect on your civilization and we perceive most strongly that you are moving in unity you are moving toward shall we say although it is a diverse definition a common goal therefore yes we are very excited and thank you for noticing that's wonderful since this is a relatively small room I humbly suggest that you do lower the channel's voice volume a little bit anyway would you like it a bit louder than that oh much love the volume of material will be the same no matter what the volume for me thank you anyway during some previous sessions you've made reference to your mother's ships and in one session you even assisted the group to visit one of your mother's ships and since I am an engineer I find very fascinating the subject of mother shifts and would welcome more understanding and some information question number one oh what number one what is the overall purposes of mother's ship in general it will be to explore shall we say distant regions from our particular shall we say home world location and also in doing so to transport many individuals with many various types of shall we say smaller craft which in general will exist in the outermost layer our crafts for those who shall we say are new to these interactions mother crafts are cylindrical they are from one to ten miles in length they are a tube within a tube within a tube the center point being up for all decks and the outermost deck will house what will colloquially and this is very colloquial to your language but correspond with the hanger bay which has full skin that allows smaller craft to enter into the whole of the craft and that particular outer layer will correspond to a section that we reserve so to speak for the formation of artificial environments that will accommodate those that visit so therefore shall we say individual societies that choose to visit our mother craft will be quite comfortable even if the components of the atmosphere of their home world differ quite greatly from our home shaped like a cylinder maybe as long as ten miles face now in general the one that i am associated with is approximately one mile in length but there are larger vessels for various reasons and that will depend upon the region being explored and shall we say the demographic location of the population of said region oh large mites the diameters get of that cylinder and now they will vary approximately what you would call six hundred of your feet in diameter i see how many people might be on that largest mothership tens of thousands again our permanent population of our planet is two hundred two two hundred and fifty million two-thirds of which at any time are generally shall we say upon mother craft and what portion of the population of one of those mother ships might be the ones that go out on scout craft a high percentage that will purely depend upon the exploration shall we say a percentage not necessarily high understand that being spontaneous we have no agenda we have no schedules we have no shall we say laid down plans so therefore this becomes quite arbitrary and quite very so each mothership has no one person in charge the capitan not really there will be perhaps what you could sometimes call he does not translate for any terminology that we use through your language will seem like a hierarchical structure i was going to be saying command center but in a sense it is more a coordinating center that will be can these mother ships relocate instantaneously anywhere in the universe as much as we have discussed with our particular technology by surrounding the craft with a particular field that isolates it in time and space and inserting if you will another location coordinates into what would translate again and this is arbitrary as our main computers do your mothership operate or can they operate in more than one dimension absolutely and that is one of the reasons for their particular shall we say orientation that is also one of the reasons for the triangular shape of our scout craft it is shall we say a very stable structure for what you might call interdimensional penetration i see a traveling pyramid it is more like an equal animal trying fly on july 26th were there any of your mother ships in our neighborhood hey i'm in as well as three of our scout craft around your planet itself more than one of your mother's ship no and was shall we say one mile in length and was a craft that we have sometimes discussed that the vibration of the name of the craft and again this is arbitrary and for the convenience of societies for we have no language but would in your particular language try and translate translate to solar wind is any humanoid see that mothership no and in general they will be too far to actually see though it is our perception that several individuals then perceive the scout craft from time to time your mother ships are cylindrical well in the movie encounters of the third time what at least the last ten minutes of the movie or so it was sort of more like a typical softer shape or disc or well understand perhaps that is an analogy to what you would call a city ship which is again similar to a mother craft and not precise to what exists but there are many different presentations of how societies will create city ships or mother crafts one last question oh uh the source of energy are there more than one sources life itself not electromagnetic well it is converted in a sense you can perhaps say by a method and again this does not translate into your language precisely but perhaps you can say of cold fusion via a particular device we have created called a flash matrix which in that sense allows for the transposition in time and space for also again being that time and space are one idea the ability to traverse space in this particular way also immediately then enables one to traverse time in the same way for time is also a vibrational coordinates of the object itself and again as a recap briefly our particular understanding that has enabled us to travel in this way is understanding that objects do not exist within time and space but that time space is a property of the object itself and therefore can be measured in that way factored out and a new shall we say time space coordinate plugged in thereby resulting in the immediate taking up of residence at the new coordinates with no quote unquote corresponding travel of distance in between i say did i know all that that you just told me in the last ten minutes now obviously or the channel's mouth would be moving and you would hear no words if you hear them and they make sense you contain it i'm smarter than i thought it was well you are smarter perhaps a thing you have even knowledge up till now but you are now acknowledging it and we thank you wonderful thank you very much thank you very much thank you very much thank you thank you okay i just wanted i have a showing that a couple of questions oh thank you we always in that sense honor and respect and request statement as well as questions okay briefly i am if you look at the ship how the you are home meditation oh it's very clear and i i got into it instantly but i was greeted by it being called Maya or Mayan okay i didn't get the feeling that this person was um like my future self no it was in a sense a past a past recognition from your own planet i thought who is Maya in a sense you may understand it to be an individual perhaps you can say in guide form that in a sense was reestablishing connection with you and has direct ties or direct connections to the Mayan themselves okay therefore should you choose to continue to explore this particular individual will facilitate as guide and perhaps you will again relive quote unquote some of your past life okay there are certain shall we say aspects within that life that you can now call upon not that you need it not that you cannot do it without that but that maybe it's an assistance in recognition to you to proceeding with something that you are about to embark upon thank you thank you you know so it's another question now i saw what to see to be um a picture frame hanging on a wall i have scratched the colors in in it moving but it was like it was moving with water it was sense what you are proceeding would you colloquially be called an expression of a type of technology that we possess that is many times used in an artistic form hence your particular interpretation of framed which it was not and is referred to as liquid light and i also felt that it was um reacting to my energy as i was uh it is a mirror of sorts and in a sense you become the art and your appreciation itself interacts with the actual shall we say presentation it's amazing also what's it giving off any sound in a sense what you may understand that its vibration its particular frequency is not only reaching into what you would call visible light spectrum but also encompasses though you cannot quote unquote see this part of it for your perception of this frequency is hearing but in a sense may say it contains more than just one or the other frequency contains both that that's right and it's not only yes like okay why mom is subject then i remember meeting um the show it could be my symbol but it was then like a circular seat half half light down now now what is this is a symbol for me obviously well first of all perhaps you will interpret it as a symbol but that was literal that was the shot okay also also i visited with um with iah and i saw child in the middle the center of the room and not not in the crib but the baby was suspended with a light um a white light she said it in the air did you notice in that sense the infant as being surrounded by three individuals no oh this is in a sense part of perhaps you can say a process i refrain from calling it a process for it is not ritualistic but that in a sense had to do with the crystallization of that particular shall we say infant consciousness in a particular way add to result in a stronger identification with the body itself for in our society as well as your own there is a very loose relationship of body to consciousness shall we say individuals three years and younger are out and about to in front and let's connect it to the body and that is generally locked in at approximately three years of age however there are exceptions whereby through particular symbolic means individuals will choose to be crystallized before this is quite rare and you have in that sense discovered and taken part in that process okay now is that child of life shoot yourself no comment okay i knew i knew that the child another child is about how do i communicate with this being that it's so young right now what am i just getting screwed up with time well screwed up i don't know for in our sense our progression of time as yours is linear and not spiraling however you understand that you need not treated as a child and simply your approach as an equal will in that sense allow you to communicate directly for understand in no uncertain terms i though i have learned perhaps you can say a few words do not speak your language and that is not necessary to communicate right okay now all along i've used that as not a barrier but um i couldn't figure out in my mind being said density how the hell i could you know have a chat with this child who i knew was my future self-doubt right i finally asked that question well also understand the following that particular process being that that child is younger than the three years in crystallizing the consciousness with the body in a sense facilitates your ability to do so which is one of the reasons you were there and now from this point forward you may understand that though you might find a degree of difficulty in communicating with the child of the lesser age than three in general because of the lack of crystallization that in this case it will be more possible does that make sense yes thank you oh thank you also understand that should there be the desire of that when we next meet at this same location next month of your time again if it is requested we will take another excursion that will be up to you we thank you i enjoyed that thank you and you as well over there nice please please support the craft today okay this particular shall we say day as it is upon my planet is myself is male individual we have not discussed and is female individual that we have discussed as loosely relating to my counterpart consciousness and we will shall we say provide a label for this evening and that label will be Anya hey please let me hear and the mail of can you tell us anything about the mail at this time only that this mail is also involved with communicating to your society and in a sense is observing any specific relationship to myself no it is shall we say a relationship with someone that you would consider from this particular proximity to be in a remote location of your planet oh could you at this time give us more information on the flat and the flat matrix not really there will be some forthcoming information along our technological lines but for specific reasons not this evening all right um i'm glad you you brought up the the idea of your time stream being ten times faster than ours one more we will add however that for the purposes of instilling some idea within you to be able to grasp the later sharing that you have a particular electronic components that you call a capacitor it is in its function an object which in a sense builds up a charge to a particular assigned point depending on the value of the mechanism and then when that particular charge point is reached discharges as a whole the entire concept in a sense that will do with the foundational analogy to the flat matrix it allows for a very controlled reaction hey thank you as we along when when um um when i experienced uh you and all the other uh quine your craft in Kansas before i perceived the craft i saw what i what i perceived this time to be a small cloud and it was there for a good period of time i can't tell you if it was five minutes or 20 minutes or an hour i'll put a good period of time with the car then it appeared that the cloud resourced and then there was the craft hey that will somehow sometimes be the interpretation of the isolation here we create rounding about our craft if in that sense individuals have not seen such a type of field the place the frame of reference that they will in general sort is as cloud like also understand that from time to time there is what you perhaps can say a particular vortex of electromagnetic energy that is created with the trunks position from one system to another and sometimes there will be the physiological shall we say conglomeration of cloud mass around such an interdimensional gateway did that try to yes you did it what i'd like to to ask is in our time frame how long does that cloud for a phenomenon persist when you're inserting yourself into another dimension or time-space reality it will vary again according to your perception and your creation of time at that moment our particular experience in a sense you can say is five to seven minutes as your experience hey i know perhaps you can say the entire trip from our particular end takes perhaps you can say fifteen to twenty minutes and this is not again the actual transposition but the preparation and the shall we say being materialization of the field itself so then assuming i was very interested in this phenomenon because it's kind of keeping up with cars is going hundred miles an hour of i couldn't perceive the classic cloud for perhaps anywhere from ten minutes to a half hours that correct in general again not for that will be a bit longer than you would generally perceive it okay but again interpreted when i was up on the cake lord lord and i took an excursion one evening of waht into the dunes of near province town the dunes span about a mile and a half from the highway to the to the ocean and we walked in probably uh somewhere between a quarter and a half a mile was a very very dry evening the sand was dry the foliage was bone dry and walking the dune required quite a bit of effort at least at first i found in perfectly shaped and perfectly dimensioned walking step actually i found a step at first i perceived it to be a step about came dimensions that was laying on the dry the dry sands when i picked it up it was dripping with moisture the moisture was not seawater because i tasted and it was not urine because i thought that's not home in urine now i assume from the reaction that this is particularly shall we say significant to the members within this room well the reason why i was so curious of course is the dripping wet skin dripping wet pain size stick uh in a very dry area with no destination for how it applies to leave you wet i picked it up stuck in the ground uh stuck in stiff in the ground we walked off perhaps uh another 200 yards spent maybe 10 15 minutes when we came back that stick was almost bone dry i grabbed it and realized that where i grabbed it was perfectly formed from my hand it had been very carefully cut at the top it was a it appeared to be a beach of limb and it was perfect height for a walking stick it was then that i noticed i felt a sense of power from that step and as you begin to walk with it i do the analogy of feeling like moses leading the people through the wilderness when i actually had that sense of this is this is a special moment this is a special time uh this is is an unusual stick i was meant to find it and i had a sense that it was awakening within me a sense of purpose it's almost a sense of of destiny and certainly was serving to a line my a line is a sense that i felt integrated and on purpose and focus would you please comment on this stick and there is simply nothing to add you have given yourself the answer some feedback my my perception is that the and i felt this as soon as i felt the whiteness of the stick that this this stick was was of interdimensional origin now that is not necessarily our perception not to as you say rain upon your parade or perhaps upon your stick but understand that that no less means that you are connected to it as a symbol that no less means that you have attracted it as a symbol and that perhaps you can shall we say derive many ideas from it but ground yourself it is a representation of grounding itself therefore you need not search for shall we say extra terrestrial or dimensional origin did you make some comment that on how this deck came to be dripping wet not really understand that we do not know everything and if there is something that is not in our immediate awareness it simply has no relevance to us and in that sense will not assist you for us to reflect to you so we simply trust that in this case come on thank you very much and hello great great to be with you um great to be with you all as well thank you yes it's great to be with this group yes um it's been a uh incredible months for me um oh thank you without looking at the past because it is the past now but i feel like a snake shedding its skin oh and uh it's been quite a journey so far that shedding in that sense not only allows you to redefine who you are but also gives you some space to grow yeah it's been quite a process as it still is if you create the need for a process right but you can simply have instantaneous results yeah well as i've been learning um um i've been listening to the tape from last month and i've been um think using the uh the five ideas of so-called membership to the association that you spoke of hey and um i i've been thinking about those and they seem to uh really pulled a lot of things together for me um i just had a question about the synchronicity oh well could you define it in an example for instance oh what everything is synchronicity and synchronicity is everything synchronicity is not something which occurs within and synchronicity is simply the synchronous occurrence of all ideas as interconnected interwoven and therefore having something to do with each other all things being connected means everything has a reason everything has a particular perspective right and reason to exist therefore your recognition of synchronicity as seeing anything that happens as part of the process and not in that way an interruption in the process allows you to be consciously aware of synchronicity in your life your willingness to then act as though that is so then brings bicycle progression more awareness of synchronicity so being aware that everything is synchronicity acting that way that makes you more aware that everything is synchronicity giving you that much more ability to act that way and so on and so forth till you are simply automatically assuming that synchronicity is how everything is and the assignment of positive meaning within your synchronous awareness and recognition gives the positive outcome the positive response so therefore you begin to create a momentum that replaces the self-denying momentum and should you again choose to look at everything as belonging and treat it that way and create actions that represent that you then will literally have an ecstatic explosion of coincidences interrelated incidences which seem on the surface unrelated delivering to your life all the things you say you prefer in the most unexpected of ways for everything that you wish to have in your life can be there and can be there in a timely manner when you project and assume you can only achieve something in a particular way that prolongs the process that sets up the separation that creates more time when you simply understand that everything is interrelated and that you can deliver what it is you wish in the most unexpected of ways but a way which is available in a given moment you begin to more instantaneously manifest the things you prefer does that assist you? Wow. You always come up as strong isn't it? And I love your volume. I believe what I'm saying. Yes and I love your excitement and your volume by the way. I love you as well. Fine with me. Thank you. Oh thank you. Okay then let's an example on my end of it if I bump into somebody in the grocery store and our groceries explode all over the floor. Is that the thing? Now you can understand that should you react in a particular negative way you will obviously get a negative effect but should you shall we say take advantage of your creation in a positive way you may find very often important life changing ideas can occur because you are accepting something that you thought was extremely as belonging you can then see why you created it and have the eyes to use it in a positive way perhaps that person is shall we say owning the very business that employs people to do the things that excite you the most. Yeah but you would not know that if you said you sure. I didn't do that it didn't happen and I didn't do that but I understand. Yes I do understand it it's better great thank you. Now when we say everything fits we mean it all that therefore everything is significant shall we say if you are in a line in your grocery store because the person and before you and after you is wearing it means something the dirt on their shoes means something everything means something. Now it may have varying degrees of relative significance to your life but understand that these are co-created situations so therefore somebody within that situation will find direct relative significance if it is obvious how this serves you allow it to serve you in that obvious way if it is not obvious assume that either it will unfold or was significant for someone else and therefore you perform the service in that way by being an enhancing example for someone else. Okay that's great I like to move on just the next thing. Well we would wish in these particular interactions to shall we say add a stretch limit your shall we say questions to one or two so that we can shall we say sample some more that are available and should we find the tendency and momentum we will then share with you again. Okay I'll want great do you again we have asked you this before I know what I know what trust us on this I do because I think I know why. Over there. Oh right. Oh right. I'm thinking to elaborate for comfortable too long. Oh right now you understand that you have a reserve. Oh my god. I'd like to explore the symbol of having amoeba that I found out today that I have a parasite in my intestines and I'm open to exploring the positivity of that. Oh and not the negative again I can feel myself going on really thick and immediately I felt thick and I didn't feel sick before that but that was interesting. So I'd like to explore the symbol of it I'm not I have an idea of what it may mean well now in general to what you would label parasite assumes by convention that's something externally as though you are not the entire universe crept in there and it's sucking off your energy so to speak. That's right. Therefore now extending this analogy to your practical life tell me. That's exactly the analogy I got. My idea might believe that others can suck up my energy now we have discussed to some degree before that that is up to you. Right. But your performance of the service that you have to offer other individuals need not between you and only will seem to do so if you take responsibility for how they then integrate what you are sharing rather than leave it off as your responsibility of being too being responsible to them by simply sharing what you have to share. Right. Nice to be learning this very rapidly. Well in a sense again you are forcing yourself in no uncertain terms to do so. So simply consciously decide from this point forward to do that and that symbol will simply again then having delivered its message have no reason to hang around and then symbolically you will physically create the immune response to shall we say integrate that symbol even physically but it always comes first from consciousness for all reality is an extension of consciousness no exceptions not even you. All right and as we're saying that I'm hearing the pardon me that says I some days I can do that. Oh the heart of that. Oh well you are writing the rules do you like those rules. No I don't know. All right well nobody has forced them upon you and your simple recognition that parts of you says this can be refrained. We have shared that you are not a collection of parts you are a whole integrated being. When you say part of me says this part of me says that that is truly in that sense impossible and how you can use these parts as an integration is to simply change part of me to a choice within an option therefore that is one option of how to look at it the moment you even say it that way that pre-assumes in your orientation that there are other options or choice and then with the weight from it being a shall we say etched in stone part of you. You are not a collection of parts that is simply a be we an emotion a thought within you that is one choice here is a choice do you wish for that to be the choice you choose. Yes or no. No. What is the opposite choice? Status right now. The opposite choice is that I'm there to um commune with another in my healing work and share the gifts that I have to share and then it's up to them whether or not and how the users get. Yes but also you were saying sometimes you can sometimes you can rephrase that. That I have a choice whether in each moment whether to act as the preferred me or not. All right and you can always in a non-interrupted fashion choose to interpret it in the way you wish. Now close the line take three deep breaths. Yes. Now state the new preferred belief assertive speak it with conviction. Now. The new preferred belief is that I'm there to offer a gift and I'll state it with conviction sound like it. I am there to offer a gift. I always have this ability and it is my responsibility to be who I am and also to allow those I interact with to be who they are. Now having stated that through me how does that feel? Describe it. It feels very strong. All right now in your imagination how do you see yourself with this feeling with this conviction with this assertion? How do you see yourself carrying your body? Very straight myself. It's like very strong. How do you see yourself when the option that sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't comes along? Now with the straight up perspective with the new belief in place when the old choice comes along how do you now speak to it? How do I speak to you? I feel the new you feel it. See it see yourself standing up straight. The old voice comes along. What does the new preferred in power to you say to it that will acknowledge it, appreciate it for offering its choice and then choose what you wish. How does the new you handle that? The new you said. The new you. The new me said. The new me. Oh what? I'm not going to get to the new you. Your me says to the voice, oh thank you very much for sharing. I said, but thank you very much for sharing that. You have allowed me to see that this is not what I prefer. Right thank you for that. Thank you for teaching me that I have a choice and this is the choice that I prefer in the moment. And how are you now holding yourself having made that conscious commandment? Straight. You now have the template. You now have the model or mold to proceed when and if that should ever happen again. Right. Now you are approaching it as the preferred you rather than the un-preferred you trying to become the preferred you. Exactly. You already are and thank you. Thank you. Yes, thank you. Is there something? Yeah, I have one other actually sort of a sharing and I am last week on my birthday. On the 20th I let it workshop on pleasure and I was told that I was channeled dolphin. And which you did. Which I did definitely. And the dolphin's name was Dreamer and I'm not sure if that was a particular dolphin or. It was a particular dolphin though there are several that function in that capacity and we're all generally be called by the same name Dreamer. Yeah, I was told to go to a particular beach I live in in the end pocket and on that day I started to swim and I could feel the dolphin energy around me and he said that he would keep their community and my life would teach me how to live in pleasure and have pleasure in my body. Well they have a lot of practice on that. Right. Also perhaps as a point of interest they were physically quite close to. I mean that's right because the beach that I went led to I had never been to or never even existed and I had gotten lost earlier that morning looking for something and happened to find this beach. There is the possibility for direct interaction at that location. That I felt that very strongly I have never been prior to that. I was drawn to the dolphin from that way and it was very exciting to me to them as well. And it felt very familiar in fact that I had in previous incarnations perhaps or in other realities interacted with them. You are. That was my sense. And related and I and one more I just wanted to share one other thing the last time I had an interaction with you which was in July I believe I was speaking to you about the white brotherhood and you had said to me that on occasion the white brotherhood will manifest in physical form and that I shall meet one very soon. And two things that had happened the day after I had a healing session with a person who actually part of them who was I believe the white brotherhood incarnated as I was standing there. And I also have been channeling the white brotherhood and I channeled Christ last week and I'm feeling and I'm here this is a little part of actually okay there's an option in me that feels a little afraid to say this and they feel a little presumptuous but no need to but you're processing that when you said I would meet his white brotherhood face to face I believe what I'm feeling is that part of that is that's me now understand you need not feel in any way evident to share this for the Christ consciousness literally exists within you all is the mass consciousness itself and though from time to time has manifested as a singular individual to relate shall we say as one on one two other singular individuals the shall we say prediction of the second coming is the manifestation of the Christ consciousness through the masses therefore you are one example of allowing that perhaps somewhat before other individuals and your willingness to channel that unconditionally loving perspective into the actions of your life will have you being that type of master right and that was what I was getting in that the white brotherhood some of the masters so to speak has been around me in my healing work and in my daily life helping me to integrate the Christ that's within me to emerge and since you are part of the process it is you you need not separated to create more time to then need to reintegrate it later on right so that so tying that in with with me taking or killed me taking responsibility for others is um is me um bringing this gift of the Christ consciousness communing with others so that they can have the Christ consciousness emerge within that and that will take the form of unconditional love which can do no harm to anyone it is perhaps you can say your versions of conditional love which results in the tumult upon your plan but when you remove those conditions and act as a reflection of unconditional love you have nothing but something to offer and it seems that there's something to offer it's manifest I mean my excitement is to manifest it's in channeling workshops well how exciting that and you will always know if it is that energy if there is no judgment within it or judgment is the imposition of conditions and unconditional love is not shall we say something that yields judgment you have a suggestion that the vibration level to me is extremely high relaxed and my body was reacting a little bit to the new vibration that is the judgment itself okay relax take deep breaths allow yourself to allow there is no effort necessary okay great thank you very much happy timing we will pause for a short break of 10 to 15 of your minutes of counting and resume contact at that time here.........
