 Greetings this evening of your time. As you create time to resist, I will not ask you how you are, for I know you are all perfect, perfect expression of whatever it is you are exploring in any given moment. Allow me to begin by thanking you all for your willingness to co-create this interaction with me and members of my society this evening of your time. Although we identify ourselves as extraterrestrials, by the way to us you are extraterrestrials. We do not in any way insist that anything that we have to say or any way that we are creating our lives is any better than your own. In fact we recognize and perhaps you will understand as your own awareness of other forms of life expands that all method of expression, all ways of being, are not only completely valid but completely equal. Therefore though there are certain things that have worked for us in our society that perhaps will be of use to you. This does not assume that what we are saying is any better than what you are already doing. As I have said you are all perfect creators, flawless and therefore you are already creating a complete reality. So completely do you create your own reality that you actually can experience the appearance of being a separate being cut off from the rest of all reality not connected to all the rest of the reality that you contain to us. This is a very, very focused exploration. The way that your society creates and expresses its consciousness is a very focused expertise. You are all specialists in limitation, specialists in separation if you will. I do not say this to Pope Bonnichi. I say this with the utmost respect of the courage that it entails to experience yourself in such a way. You have very literally for the last 25,000 years of your social history created yourself as a very focused point of view. So focused once again that you would seem to be separate from the rest of creation. One of the reasons we are able to communicate with you at this time is you are arising from this cycle of limitation. You are expanding from this fine degree of focus to begin to entertain the notion that perhaps, just perhaps, you actually have more to do with the statement of yourself as a being with your very reality than you have heretofore chosen to express and heretofore chosen to understand. What I am saying is that you are expanding both individually and collectively. As you do so and your awareness expands, your awareness of many other things and many other ways of being by extension also expands. So therefore you attract on perhaps what you now perceive to be the edges of your reality what you sometimes refer to as weird phenomena. Things that couldn't have possibly existed before this particular time. Many many things obviously exist that you are not aware of individually and as you expand and grow you become more aware and marvel and revel at the things that exist. One of the ideas within that awareness as you begin to explore parts of yourself or in the way that you create yourself as an expression of parts many times are the more alien portions of yourself. In certain ways this is what your ability to now perceive me although only in this format this point represents beginning to explore those corners as you create them of your consciousness beginning to expand your point of view to encompass more. You are beginning to collectively entertain the notion that there is life other than upon your planet intelligent life. From my perspective this is a given but each and every one of you will make your own decision. I do not insist by the way that you believe who I say I am. It is not important for these interactions. I am more concerned with sharing information with you and learning from you as well and then you can decide if the information is useful to you and if it is by all means use it if not you will still have learned more about who you are by seeing a sparkling example of who you are not. So either way you learn either way you grow either way and this applies by the way to anything that you attract in your reality you expand and define yourself still further. Ironically as you define yourself further and further you realize how big so to speak you really are for although you now create the appearance that you exist within a reality so large are you and I mean this arbitrarily that in actuality you are coming to find that the reality exists within you and at least from a physical point of view this is very large. Therefore you may understand that as you attract awareness and expand your consciousness and awareness you begin to recall to remember to attract the tools to allow you to accelerate that awareness. Many of the things we discuss with you may seem to fall under the category you sometimes refer to as metaphysical because we speak of yourselves as creators beyond the physical metaphysical but also do we include that ability to create your physical reality as well and one of shall I say the most notable reason that we interact with you is your readiness and your willingness to begin to understand yourselves as creators that much more because we create our own reality 100% consciously we are some just some of the shall I say sharers that you attract. Sometimes you will say when you are ready the teacher will come that is one of your sayings but I will refrain from using the word teacher for we are all equal sharers each of us teach what it is that we have to in that sense share but we also always learn and remembering that allows you to remain open allows you to balance the energy of output with the energy of receptivity so therefore I learn from you as well and I thank you for your willingness to allow me to experience your consciousness for the more I understand about you the more I understand about me for to me you all exist within my consciousness the paradox is that this is true for each and every person perhaps at first that seems confusing but that will change as you expand your awareness each individual contains the entire reality that sounds like a bunch of nonsense all right that is the nature of paradox things that would seem to be mutually exclusive it must be this it must be that when you actually find out that it is bold not this or that but both so you are in a sense individuals each with your own individual point of view and yet you each contain the entirety of reality and this will make more sense as you do expand your awareness right now make a note of it one of the things that we discuss with you is creating your reality consciously for as we have mentioned and as you have heard and as many of you entertain you do create your own reality but you have a definition that when you do so not according to preference not according to intention that you do so unconsciously the moment you allow yourself to be aware of something however it is now a conscious aware so if you entertain the notion that you create your reality even if you entertain that some of it is created by you unconsciously you can begin to allow the unconscious quote unquote portion of your creation to become conscious so that your reality is a reflection is an extension of your intention and your preference rather than a random event subject to the whims of your temperamental subconscious mind that is what makes you look at but as you allow awareness unconscious becomes conscious you call it unconscious knowing we call it conscious unknowing the same term like a different spin conscious unknowing this puts it back into your power to change unconscious knowing this has you searching behind every nook and cranny as you say within your partition reality as you create you are all 100% being one of the way that you express yourself and define yourself as a collection of parts not only body parts but different parts of your conscious our understanding is that there is one conscious you are one whole 100% being therefore you can express it by being willing to allow things to be conscious the way very simply and this is by way of what you would call slight review from our last interaction and many others that you now create your own reality is very simple in any given moment regardless of what is present in that moment and your excuse or reason for doing so you decide who you are you make a decision I am this person now either you do so consciously because of this who you desire to be or you do so because this is telling me this this is here this is here so I must be this type of person but either way you decide you make a decision consciously creating your own reality will allow you to make that decision with intention because you say so with self-commandment which is one of your abilities to express but very often you will identify circumstances in a given moment and say well I must be this person because look at the mess I've created that is still a decision I am this person so your reality and the perpetuation of the creation of your reality begins with deciding who you are once you decide who you are the next thing you do perhaps somewhat automatically at this point is you trust in that decision well I am this person therefore this person act this particular way this person responds this particular way you trust you play along with the decision very literally and thirdly you act as though you trust in that decision in who you have defined yourself to me and through these actions in your physical life you create phenomena circumstances interactions and then what you refer to as reaction we have discussed with you consciously deciding who you prefer to be as the first step in consciously creating your reality therefore perhaps at first this will involve some of what you call insightful thinking some of what you call touching base with the things that move with the things that excite you with the things that bring you joy with integrity allowing yourself to identify who you prefer to be allows you to stay allows you to make that decision with focus with conscious intention I am this person because this issue I choose to be and this is what makes me feel like I am the person I wish to be deciding consciously who you are by extension in order to allow that conscious decision to become your life then requires the trust that now that you have made the decision that's who you are no matter what no matter what the reality may appear like if you maintain that decision you maintain that awareness of your intention and you maintain the trust in that decision you can determine the action or free which will be consistent with that decision in any given moment allow me to entitle this interaction opportunity of alignment as you make the decision to be the person that you choose to be if there is some method that you have created in your thinking that runs contrary to that decision it comes up and allows you to see it when it comes up and allows you to see it you have a choice you can say well now that I see this I will use this as an opportunity to align myself to who I prefer to be to remind myself to who I choose to be or I can allow whatever the circumstance to talk me out of it and to be evidence that of course I'm not that person or this would not exist therefore things that come up initially that would seem to run contrary or would seem to ward on the surface the decision that you have made as to who you are are actually opportunities of alignment they are your opportunity to read a line to reaffirm who you are in that moment therefore many of the things that you have allowed to talk yourself out of being the person who you desire to be are actually the very tools the very opportunity to allow you to reestablish that person and show yourself that you really are that person or if you are that person if you make that decision trusting that decision means not allowing anything to talk to you out if you trust the decision nothing can talk you out of it I am this person so regardless of the circumstance in my life that seems to run contrary to the thing that I desire I'm still this person and I will interact with that circumstance as this person rather than allow me to talk me out of who I have chosen to be either way you will make a decision trust that decision and act on the circumstance but if you allow the circumstance to talk you out of who you are the actions will be far different than if you allow the circumstance to be an opportunity of aligning yourself to who you prefer to be therefore many of the things that you label in your life in your reality in your experience as obstacles as blocks in your path are actually road time detours but at the same time opportunities to establish to apply the trust in who you have decided to be consciously circumstance for instance comes along since it seems to be an issue that many of you interact with where you decide I am abundant I get home with that one and all of a sudden a symbol comes along that would seem to run contrary to the fact that you are abundant perhaps what you call one moment we do not have the allow me to access the channels memory of you have to choice it you can say I thought I was abundant but if I was abundant I would be able to pay this bill so I must not be abundant oh for me therefore you have decided in that moment utilizing an external circumstance I am not abundant after all which means you never really trusted that you were abundant you never fully trusted the decision the first challenge to that decision you go tucking your tail between your legs and running and allowing a circumstance to show you where your trust truly lies but by using that circumstance to shift your perspective to consciously apply your trust that very bill that you cannot pay is an opportunity to say I am abundant I know I'm abundant I made the decision I create my reality therefore this cannot be evidence that I am not abundant it is evidence of something and I will allow it to become apparent as it needs to but I am abundant it is my intention to be able to pay bills as they come in therefore I will look at the symbol it is there perhaps there is a deadline attached to it but I know I am abundant and therefore I intend to pay the bill I know I can't now it is not one of the options but I will move forward with the options that are available as being the abundant person rather than the tail between leg person now perhaps at first this sounds like a mental exercise or a form of placating yourself or fooling yourself or patronizing yourself that is one of the excuses that individuals will create to not trust in the decision however it is far more than that because when you choose not to decide I am abundant even though I have the bill I cannot pay you are still making a decision you are deciding I am no longer abundant I implicitly trust that I am not abundant here is the certificate and you will act believe me according to that trust you will perform actions with the foundation of the decision that you do not prefer and those actions will create circumstances that will continue to reinforce the person you say you do not choose to be so it is far more than fooling yourself it is realigning your intention and using what you have here to forelabel your greatest liabilities as your access one by one if you proceed as the individual who must not really be abundant your actions in reflecting that will continue to create circumstances which will continue to reinforce that you are not abundant if you use it as an opportunity to align that you are you will do something different you will move different you will hold yourself different you will interact with individual difference you will maintain that abundant consciousness and the results of those actions obviously would be different and will create circumstance whereby you can pay the bill because you have looked at the issue the belief that underlies the symbol the bill is nothing external that has control over you the bill is a symbol of an internal concept everything in physical reality is this is what you begin to realize as you expect everything is a symbol even the eye on it is a symbol it is a symbol of your integrity of your agreement and of your ability to create to the level that you desire opportunities and the lines are all around you if you decide this is who I am you completely trusted and completely act that way and have no issues that run contrary to that decision the circumstance will reflect that and things will not seem to come up that run contrary but if things do come up that remain that would seem contrary they are allowing you to get to the core of these issues to reestablish your preference to reestablish who you choose to be and when you act that way those actions have results those results reinforce your decision and down the line those opportunities become left and left because you handle the issues that underlies them all circumstance all reality literally is an external reflection of an internal substance of consciousness you created in terms of thoughts emotions and belief but it is truly consciousness therefore look around when you decide who you are embrace the opportunity you can actually have fun with it you can actually enjoy reaffirming yourself you will actually begin to see well this month I can pay this bill well this month I am able to get this thing that I say would be reflective of my abundance but not by selling out to circumstance not by allowing the issues that you have to talk you out of who you prefer to be but by allowing them to reinforce your clear intention I am this person therefore I approach the situation as this person and I act as this person decision trust in the decision acting as though you trust in the decision this is how you create this is how you've always created and this is how you can create consciousness now again I am not saying you have to perhaps many of you enjoy the limitation perhaps you enjoy the separation perhaps you understand that the natural quote unquote natural state is expansion is understanding your connection is the one that so you are getting your feet in the mud of limitation and creating it to enjoy what is unique about feeling limited feeling separated is unique it is an unusual exploration in the scheme of things we interact with many different societies what you would refer to as alien extraterrestrial society and there is perhaps you can say a broad spectrum of the degree to which societies will create a fine focus I will say that a majority of the societies that we interact with maintain far less of a focus than your own they maintain an understanding of their overall connection to everything as themselves emanating as a spark of the infinite creation and not separate from the infinite creation many of these societies have quote unquote evolved their thinking to that point many of them have truly never chosen to create that degree of limitation so in many ways your society is unique to us and an opportunity to learn now the paradox is we are not able to interact with you in too much of the infancy of this focus because when you are so finely focused you cannot perceive of us you will not accept the idea of any other consciousness of any other life of any other being so already to even be having such an interaction you have evolved your thinking process you have expanded your awareness to the point where you entertain the notion but to us you are a fascinating race of being we respect you we honor your choice we honor your sovereignty this is why you will not see us land on mass contrary to what you may hear prior to your mass invitation that would be interfering with your choice that would be saying well you can't handle what you create it would be dishonoring you as being so therefore we remain unobtrusive we remain in the background because you are expanding your awareness you see and hear more of the possibility of our existence and certain individuals will get quote unquote physical proof of our existence but largely you will admit our existence remains speculative because we honor your sovereignty as being now you will have many individuals in your society representing our viewpoint in many ways remember I am only speaking for my own civilization but in general when you hear the point of view that you as a planet are sinking are drowning and that extraterrestrials will come down save you be me well take you up take you home this is a disservice to you as creators this is an inaccurate representation of our approach to other society and it is a disservice therefore and again you may believe whatever you wish you may attract whatever you wish when you talk about us taking you home you are not acknowledging that because you create your reality and choose to do so on some level of your awareness for now at least this is home home is wherever you are home is what you are if you allow yourself to be aware of this you can begin to feel this and understand you carry home around with you if you insist that home is somewhere else you are always going somewhere and never quite getting there because you are bringing home around with you anyway and not realizing it it may seem to some of you that it is cruel to quote unquote allow knowing what we know and having the abilities that we have the suffering as you created on your planet and I understand that it seems perhaps ridiculous in one way of looking at it to assume that anyone who is involved in such suffering creates it on some level though it may appear cruel to say that it is actually honoring that decision now this does not mean that we condone violence famine injustice cruelty no we do not condone it at all therefore in our reality in our society we do not create it but we understand that on some level of your awareness you are choosing to experience that degree of separation and now are choosing to expand your awareness you can certainly be who you are and make a positive difference on your planet but you cannot take responsibility for anyone else you can only be responsible to them in whatever way you are able to assist them but you cannot do anything for them and the mere fact that you cannot allow you to see in no uncertain terms that they create their experience you create your experience sitting in a comfortable chair it may be completely unthinkable that anyone would create lack limitation famine separation but you are sitting in the comfortable chair from this perspective thinking about that and not understanding the overall focus your planet as a whole is moving away from this but in doing so a lot of the remnants or vestiges of these ideas are shaking up and what you call your ability to globally communicate is allowing one group one person to have an experience and many many many many groups and many many many individuals to participate from a far in that experience to be aware of that experience so in this time on your planet when individuals create certain explorations that would seem negative not only do they get to explore the results of their particular creation but so do you all from the comfort of your own living room over what you call your television set so the expanded awareness also manifest as what you call global communication which is expanding at an exponential rate upon your planet right now so you can look for the sign that you are not evolving as a rate you can look for the excuses to keep yourself down or you can look for the absolute evidence that you are expanding that you are increasing your ability to reach out that you are increasing your ability to be living examples which is the strongest form of the system doing something for someone to the degree that they are not then able to do it for themselves is a form of what you call dependence being the person that you assume you should be and being a living example of what can be is a far stronger symbol to everyone involved and as I have said you can all see each other more now so this is a very exciting time for you all if you choose to see if you choose to decide who you are not only will it make an absolute difference in your life but you will add that many more positive reflections that many more positive options to the life of others and then interacting with you very literally this is what we do simply explain our perspective simply post another option so that if it looks attractive you have one more option if it does not you will attract another source you always have you always will the irony is that these sources are all reflections from inside of you when you decide who you are and a circumstance comes along that seems to test you many of you say well god or all that is of the universe is testing me not really you are testing there is no outside universe there is no outside all that is or infinite creator you are an expression of the universe of all that is of what you call god directly whether or not you choose to express that is an option and that option is part of the unconditional love of the creative force therefore I thank you for your ability to increase your awareness to expand your awareness to the point where we can have such conversation very literally though it is not again in any way necessary these types of interactions and these types of infusions of acting like conscious creators on your part from whatever the source bring us closer together to interacting physically it is our perception that we will interact physically with your society maybe a few years of your time from now but all that it will require is personal intention personal transformation personal request it is not the point that we interact it is perhaps what you would call fringe benefit or perhaps what you would call side effect of expanding your awareness but never will we present ourselves to you as proof that we exist will we already know we exist and we don't eat proof in honor and in return for your willingness to allow me to interact with you in this way and allow other members of my society to perhaps again say participate peripherally I thank you and I ask you how we may mutually share and be of service to each other sharing I recently came across this idea photon belt can you talk about that a little bit repeat photon belt it's beer our solar system is going to enter photon belt sometime around in between March of 1995 and December 1996 photon belt one more though what you call your solar system is in motion and though many various aspects of what you call space or emotion it is not my particular perception that you will be directly passing through any perhaps again what you are referring to is concentrated form of photonic matter or photon so though this is constantly occurring it is not to my awareness that there is a concentration of that that you will physically pass understand what you call photon or packets of light so to speak to simplify greatly and they are all around you are literally photons in one way of looking at so perhaps what an individual may be perceiving is as you individually begin to shine to be that light you may create a concentration of that light on your planet but as far as so much truly passing through it at least from our ability to scan it would not take that for that answer the question yes and if I can add something as what if we come across information like this books or from people and it just so much interesting stuff there so I am confused because I don't know whether to take it seriously or just ignore it or well first of all I would suggest lightening up rather than taking it seriously because you are talking about packets of light but secondly how does it allow you to feel why do you wish in that sense to be we in such an idea yes I did think a lot about that and when did you come up with I would like it to happen what it represents to you to have your planet your solar system pass through a belt of light because it's supposed to make all these changes in our lives yes it will make changes in your life ah then you won't have to make is that it yes it seems too difficult the world the way it is now it seems too difficult to imagine that it will ever get any better very good that is what you have decided do you like that decision I would like a shortcut do you like the decision that is difficult oh you mean obviously you have used whatever evidence you are attracting to decide that transforming is difficult yes okay and I'm not talking for myself I'm thinking be yourself for now it will generalize later why don't you just say yes my point exactly is that that is a decision may not seem like what may seem like your assessment of an external situation in external reality but we're getting down to some mechanics what I am allowing you to be aware of because you have attracted me to reflect this and so you are prepared to hear it is that you have decided it is difficult now in making that decision on some level you will trust that decision and your actions will reflect it and perpetuate in using it as an opportunity to remember one moment I want it to be easy I decide that it is easy to transform and as a person who makes that decision I know that I will then attract the tools the resources that will allow me to express that it is easy so the photon belt as an example can be used as an opportunity to light you up as a concept so you understand yes is this useful it's useful but can I ask you you have talked about the three days of sleep that your civilization of it through and then you were transformed this individual is referring to perhaps what you would refer to in your society is our version of the coming of the collective unconditionally loving consciousness sometimes your society without getting into the person but the concept in the mass consciousness we refer to this as the coming of the Christ consciousness that is the awareness of your connection the awareness of your complete extension of yourself as all that is in acting that way in our society we began with less of an idea of separation it was not a very far stretch for us to accept that this was so we already basically embodied it so when the notion arose in the mass consciousness as a symbol as a person it only took what you would call three days for the entire civilization to allow that awareness to ripple through them and go from feeling connected to begin with to understanding the depth of that connection it was only represented in but a few days because we started out with more of the recognition of that connection your society has started out from a complete pinpoint degree of focus and therefore what you would refer to as the coming of your Christ consciousness did awake ideas in people and it did create a whole another form or option of limitation right along with it the second coming as you call it will be similar to our first it will well up in each individual that recognition that perspective but it will take a bit more than three days it is occurring will take many years in a collective way but that is because you have again approximately a twenty five thousand year history of trying on the limited point of view in the context of tens of thousands of years a few decades is about three days do you understand the analogy so it is abrupt it is sudden it does happen relatively quickly repeat idea idea is it's not going to happen soon because we are not prepared for it they are not ready yet so when we are I did not say that I said that is why and math it may seem to take a few decades individually you are ready for individually you are entertaining you are beginning to be you understand your planet as a collection loosely speaking of being a point of view of consciousness linear finite in number at least conceptual you will understand that certain individuals in linear time will seem to awaken first second third six billion and so on your focus and your best place attention is in your own transformation because as you transform within external reality reflects that transformation others may seem to change circumstances may seem to change your ability to change can happen immediately by making that decision consciousness trusting in that decision allowing any circumstances which seem to run contrary that decision to be opportunities to realign to that decision you can immediately effectively realize that for the person who knows they are abundant yet the bill that they cannot pay as a reflection realign to their abundance proven moves with that understanding does not feel the negative effect of the villainy longer and why the pain so they have immediately transformed giving themselves a loving nudge here and there it need not be difficult it can be difficult it is and can be simple you get to choose all right okay if I could just add something for the people who are listening the book I'm talking about it's channel information from Syrians and they're supposed to go through go through the five or six days of complete darkness and ice Asian no electrical appliances working and all kinds of stuff so when this kind of information comes up if you can say something for my confusion it is by the way not to invalidate any source not my perspective that that will occur it is not my understanding with my perhaps you can say ability to scan the neighborhood that that will happen but you get to decide you attracted both notions you get to decide which you you will be so both have been observed both are opportunities to a lot thank you thank you I have done nothing thank you I have done nothing my son Duncan's with me tonight I just like to introduce you so I don't think I think you have already know each other but well hello it was all I think it has a very good night so I trusted that I'd like to briefly review my last week a lot of things happen that I could easily label negative right now I don't feel like they were negative things oh right now they were not when you assess them to be perhaps you got that effect so you can say that they were both times they were neutral symbols that you were labeling and getting the effect do proceeds well overall I feel like I'm at yet another threshold something I'm at a very powerful point not to cut you off but stop therefore pay particular attention to what I have discussed with you no accident that I picked the topic that I picked it applies across the board to everyone that's present there is a collective sense thing not to get too cosmic about it that occurs when I choose what it is that I will share with all of you and you will find to whatever degree you will acknowledge it it will apply to you and very many times answer the very question that you will ask so without needing to go into a personal synopsis unless of course you desire to apply what I have said that is the next tool that you have attracted to accelerate your awareness and as you sit and synopsis eyes yourself you will see how you can apply well I believe I was this this happened did I use it to reaffirm who I am or did I use it to talk me out well I use it to talk me out until Wednesday Wednesday I remembered and so on and so forth look at it from the light of the opportunity to re align to align yourself and many of the questions that you will ask will answer them which is by the way part of my function the symbols are getting louder and louder well when you acknowledge an opportunity it transform symbols are not around to bother to be obnoxious when you do not heed them when you allow them to again perhaps and I'm very he very colloquial the language at hand that is present that is available when you allow them to talk you out of they get loud because you wish to look at the issue you wish to transform that awareness so perhaps my advice if you wish to call it that is to add you decide an establishment you are utilize the animal upon your planet called a new and be as southern. It seems that I'm perpetuating this thing to a point that is I it symbols are becoming extreme and almost violent in a negative way my spirits are up I feel positive about it like why am I creating the situations that I feel like I'm gonna take it to the max to the very point that I can no longer take it is that the only point at which you will listen to yourself or can you simply proceed from this moment forward as the person that you know you are expressing that excitement and balancing it with integrity. Why must I test myself to this point I don't choose to do that and I that's not what I desire. Ah but I know you are deciding to be a person who no longer needs to test himself as you use the opportunity and align with it you in a sense nullify the test question you use it symbol comes along you use it it transforms symbol comes along you don't use it it gets louder if it's something that you insist that you must. Function in the situations that you are creating as the person you've decided to be not as it's reciprocal as opposite. So these symbols that I'm creating seem to be telling me I'm telling myself to really get moving on what I need to do right. For instance falling off the ladder towards being faced you know it's like that was a powerful symbol and I knew I didn't want to be there doing what I was doing. All right. What is so mysterious about that nothing but I thought getting over off the table. So in other words what you are telling me is it's beginning to get painful to perpetuate being the person you do not prefer. Right. Okay. Perhaps if you use the opportunity you will not quote unquote fall from your intention. And I had words of incarceration spoke to me also which is pretty negative. Well this is the symbol that has been explored by you before not being incarcerated but the fear of the loss of your freedom. Okay. Yes. All right. What did you come up with when you have looked at this before. Life is a paradox. Now that that true though it's like I am I'm not I exist I don't exist I'm not sure what I always going on. Well first of all you are and when you are saying you are not you are and saying you are not you still are. Language gets very interesting. So what's going on I mean I'm I'm on a loss for words right now. I will as you say without having to as you say air your laundry. But the idea is you have ignored the opportunity to realign yourself to do what it is you wish to do because you still express the decision that what you wish to do will not support you. Yes. All right. No big missed. You have to first make the decision that it will I got to be more intentional about that you say you made that decision but the first thing that you create to challenge that decision you back down from that decision. That is why we again drew your attention to the beginning of this interaction and spoke about what we did begin to apply if you wish what I have said and shared with you from this point forward which is all you have this point right now. You have any illustrative historical example of what does it work now begin to heed the opportunity and use them to a lie opportunity of alignment. All right. You will tell a different story when you do so. Maybe you should choose it is always up to you. No one will force you to have too much fun or be too ecstatic. It is no one's job but your own. I got that. Yeah. Okay. Can I ask you a question? Do you feel that you deserve what you designed? Yes. Really? Because that was a big one for me this in this past year. I really feel I do deserve what I'm looking at. Do you remind yourself of that or do you sometimes use the reflections as evidence that perhaps you don't deserve it? Is this similar? I don't trust that I'm worth it. Yeah. It is similar. Okay. But you do trust that it is worth that you are worth it and you don't trust. It is not one or the other. All of you contain all beliefs. You believe your love yourself. You believe you do not. It is not a matter of getting one belief and getting rid of the other. You contain them both. The decision in the moment is calling one fourth. It's being one of those ideas and then you provide if again there are issues surrounding this opportunity to realign to that decision. So you do deserve it and allow things to point out to you that yes even in this circumstance I know I do deserve it but don't stop there. State the complete decision. I am the person who does my passion with integrity and allows it to support because I deserve. And again don't factor out the integrity. That is perhaps where what you call the symbol of incarceration enters into it. Understood. At least conceptual. Yes. Definitely. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. So nice to hear your voice. Oh thank you. It is not my voice but I understand. It is the melodious voice of the child. Well it was so nice to hear. I would like to know if you could help me through a practical exercise of what you just talked about tonight. Oh we already provided one where you are listening to that. I did listen. It was. No. But not practical enough. Let's talk about the car again. This is where we were four months ago the last time I was here. Well not exactly. Well you are the new person now saying that you are in the same place making that decision. But go on. Okay I'm now absolutely by the fact my car is falling apart. Seriously looking for a new car. My finances tell me you can't get a new car because you can't afford it. One moment. Your what? Tell us you what? My channel. Your decision. Is being made. Utilizing certain evidence. Now perhaps your checkbook is empty. But if you are an abundant person that will not talk you out of the fact that I need a new car and I need one real soon. And I deserve and decide to get the new car. My actions have been. My actions have shown that that must be my belief because I go looking for a car and decide that I'm not going to buy a junkie car because I deserve a car that feels good. Oh that is part of the process of feedback. Okay so I do that and then the salesman tells me what it will cost. And then I don't trust something. I get scared. Well I remind you always trust something. Then you do trust something. You simply trust them the thing you don't prefer. Right. And I cannot see. I mean I tend to continually say to myself I deserve and I have a wonderful feeling of deserved ability lately. As opposed to a lousy feeling of deserved ability. Yeah. Playing with your language. So the problem comes in in that my belief in deserved ability says going and buy this car. And then I say well how am I going to pay for this. But I deserve it so I can do it. Well I don't have a job and I can't bring myself to find one or get one. Well how will you get there? Your car is falling apart. Okay. So I say to myself I'm going to buy this car. So were you to act on what you feel very strongly as a reflection of who you are. You would then possess a new tool to be able to then express the next thing that would be representative of who you are. And trust that in fact I will find a way to pay for it. Well if that is what you decide. But perhaps what you decide is to use it to do something that's really exciting. And then the actions and results that are generated from that automatically through again the realignment to the decision that you are abundant to do that again automatically. Do not need to fixate on it. And truly by saying I'll be able to pay it. I'll be able to pay it. I'll be able to pay it. I don't think I can pay it. I don't know how I'm possibly going to pay it. Well I do get a sense that the decision to purchase the car that feels good is a way of empowering myself. Oh. And I do have a sense that when I make that decision and take that action there will be a very large leap in empowerment. Oh. So you are driving your way too high or consciously. Yes. Right. Okay. So that feels good. As you say in your society, happy trail. Thank you. I thank you. Hey, see you man. I have a question about puzzling dream as far as realigning what I would really like to do. I want you to help with it. Puzzling. Oh why? Yes. It's like a puzzle because in my dream, I'm in my house and the doorbell rings and I go and open the door and there's a little small oriental woman standing there with a little tiny baby that's only about nine inches long. And the little baby looks like a zeta baby and the neck is very skinny and the leg. The head is all flopping around and she's standing there absolutely emotionless and she's like, I can't take care of this anymore. And so she passes it to me. So my first instinct is to take it and oh my goodness, first you've got to get it warm and you've got to cover it up. You've got to cuddly. You've got to take care of it. Then the dream switches and I'm still in my living room, but my mother in my is sitting there and I'm telling her about this baby. And I go to the closet and I open the door and the baby is now like a human baby about nine months old sitting up very strong and smiling warmly at me and I pick up the baby and I show it to my mother-in-law and she can't bear to look at it. She picks it up, throws it on the floor and it shrinks only about five inches small. So I know I must, she's very weak and she's a little girl and she's barely alive and I know I must feed her. And I realize suddenly that there's a little packet and a clear plastic material about an inch and a half wide that's to be open and help this tiny infant. And there are tiny little crystalline pellets of some sort inside and when I try to open it up to help her it explodes in my face with a very bright light and a big bang and I wake up. Oh, how creative. For a moment, remove the mystery. Assume that the elements in the dream are you. Assume that what you are nurturing is yourself is perhaps what you refer to as that childlike spark within you and also utilize the more obvious symbols of things that perhaps you have utilized. Perhaps you have used to allow yourself to suppress that. Do you get along with your mother-in-law? Sometimes. Oh, mostly. Do you feel that you allow her to suppress that within you? Do you act differently around her? Yes, I used to and I'm not anymore and it brings out a reflection and courage that I don't like and I've always kind of avoided that before but I was kind of hoping that to be. Hoping, avoiding, oh, that reflection, interacting with that final reflection from her is the point. There are integrated ways of interacting with all these symbols, unconditionally loving ways to do so but it's a very creative set of props and symbols to allow yourself to hone into the certain things that are involved. Does it make more sense? Yes. Oh. Now there is another connection but I will allow you to ponder that as well. Well, I thought maybe our connection with the native is helping us to learn to nurture ourselves and the child within us which is me anyway. Oh, very interesting. I've not heard you men say that before. Very fascinating. Very creative. Very useful to any of you out there who are listening. I thank you. So do they? Hello. Good. My. Hi. Hi. I'm not interested in what actually happened 25,000 years ago to separate those two makers more focused. Oh my. Just the individuals assume it should be an external set of props because they often represent this reality as being a jail but in actuality it was perhaps what you would call loosely a mass conscious decision to explore a finite degree of focus and the ramifications to feeling and experiencing and expressing that degree of focus. Now this is what the foundational answer is. Does that make sense? Yes. Can you say that much responsibility for choosing to participate in the unique reality that you are with it or seeming to be with it? Yeah. Makes sense. Was there thinking of the, was it more than the other decision? I mean was there a second on the land or something like that? What you would refer to as that phenomenon would be more recent historically. Perhaps you will understand it to be the beginning of several societies or civilization that interact in a hierarchical structure for lack of better terminology. One more question. Can you give us a interpretation of what the harmonic convergence was? I read something that is a little bit more much. And then so you try to make sure that you do it. It follows a small particle first into these accelerants and stuff like that. There are what you would call celestial reflections or occurrences that may represent that particular thing but in actuality once again to bring it all home it was a consciousness oriented phenomenon. It was the result of certain momentum, intersections of consciousness, of awareness of what you would call acceleration of the awareness of consciousness. And additionally it was an awareness event, a consciousness threshold. The reflections again make and paint some of this physical phenomenon. But basically it was a threshold that your mass consciousness created that did allow an acceleration on mass. Thank you.
