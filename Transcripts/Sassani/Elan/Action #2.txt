 All right, I'll say action Hey, my old male You know my love to you for it's been almost a year since I Kind of created this experience and it's been a really great thing. I just want to thank you I believe it sounds like we haven't Yes, it is an introduction I think yes, I believe that too and and I went through my different different in different timing through that year of believing or disbelieving this and I Do believe in you utterly and mostly because I truly believe in myself now Well that to us is the bottom line everything else is inconsequential to us Therefore believing in yourself and acting that way will yield the very results that you see yes So thank you very much. Oh, thank you as well look I'd like to ask a question of that the first the first session of this these three about About keeping the vision clarifying my own vision You led us through a meditation and you didn't mention something you were leading me on about something that excited me that I wasn't able to proceed and I've been thinking about it for the past month or so and I ended up even writing down five things that excite me and Is there anything else you want to add you're doing just fine keep on keeping on and understand your answers or Delivered through the results of your actions in your reality. It is not that I am a soul source of this information I also remind you in all of you that our stream of consciousness and this is again an analogy It is colloquial not literal, but it's consistently deemed to your reality now again This is simply a colloquial But the point is is that you can tap into our stream at any time any one of you and you can in that sense communicate with me or Members of my society to the degree that you are willing to validate what you get and the degree that you are willing to Act upon what you get we'll show you again through the results of the actions of your life Certain things and will be part of the dialogue It is not that we only communicate in merely what you would proceed to the language or words but also are able to reflect and Interact with you through the circumstances the manifestations of your life So in communicating with us if you simply have a broad Understanding and do not assume we only communicate in one way You can validate where and when you feel that we are in that sense co-creating an interaction But they will understand once again that you always Ultimately choose from the options including what we share as an alternative You ultimately perform the actions and you ultimately get the credit So you're suggesting these five things that I came up with is one of those things that you were mentioning Suggesting and will allow you to enjoy them all Yeah, I enjoy my I could do them all at once and they're it down to one I have kind of a an outer cosmic question. I had a That allows questions, but I do that It will continue forever probably But I had the so-called visitation through a visualization of You are home tape and I perceived I went to a spaceship of mothercraft and I was led very quickly Or pointed in a direction by you I think to a corridor that I was able to see the star systems and it was a lot of details to it But in essence, I was led to a conference room so to speak that was meant for visiting societies as my own and someone else and I perceived Syrian society once again, which always pops up in my relationship with them Well, it's frost. Yeah, I know and I came in to this white light this room and I perceived these vertical beams of light very clear and I Know that the information that they shared was very important. I don't remember or I'm not clear on what it is Only as important as it is useful and practical in your reality Receiving nice information again is all well-in-grouped But something that you can act upon Do something about is again the bottom line and then allows for the furthering of any lines of communication If that is the necessary path of communication so ground your messages by Inserting what you can do about it. Do not let information simply be information for information Safe what can I do about this is a question that you can always ask in any situation? Well, I'm at you now. What can I do with that? I mean about doing something from information from another source Which you can then simply ask the source directly and that then puts you in the position to trust What you are getting or trust that you are not getting the right thing therefore go with it go with the source that you are sharing do not ask me about that Okay, because I you know that my relationship with that society it seems so Kind of unusual to me. I'm not sure how to ground it and how to use it. I Could I could think I do about this I can simple question from whatever you get? Sometimes will yield the well. There's nothing I can really do about that But more times than not will say ah I can actually apply that to what I was just looking at before Interesting now you are grounding When I came over the most is that I want to see this I would like to create that so others can see what I saw that and Think it's great the reasoning for needing to show this to others. I Think it's a beautiful thing. I think it's a great experience There is also the validation of what you are seeing and you do not need anyone else for that validation Simply validate it yourself Share your version of it and then those that are so attracted will then allow themselves to achieve a receptive state for similar types of experience So I I want to be clear about this. So you're suggesting that I just I continue to ask them Continue to have a dialogue. I am simply suggesting that whatever you get you ask yourself What can I do in this reality with this information that is my only suggestion? Right because I will lead to the next thing and There will be no need to ask for you will be fully engaged in your reality and as you say one thing We'll simply leave very smoothly and directly to the next All right, okay, I guess hi. Thank you. You need not guess, but it is always your option Thank you for everything and for you as well for you have created everything I And do you greasy Thank you for being gracious hosts and host The question one of the questions I want to ask deals with my career I've been as I've said before I've taken about half years off to explore a number of different options and find my heart's desire to do it in my career and I think one of the things that I've done to give me a little bit of time is get some consulting work And what I'm doing is analyzing strategies of utilities for coming, California It's offered me a job in Washington now the work has been very difficult for me to do at home Just doing it once a week. So the idea of Communion Washington wearing a suit working a six every day Doing you know analyzing companies are stuck in the status quo. It's not exciting family What excites me you mean in that sense trust however that it will support you Oh I have that for a reason due to The what's up exciting is when I look at the TV and see all the stuff going on in the world I get a tremendous feeling of energy going through me that Kind of an intuitive confirmation of what you said earlier that yes the world definitely is Accelerating rapidly into the summer transformation information when I see all the stuff happening in the economy and political realm around the world and that And using my business background and stuff that I've learned from you and other spiritual sources. I want to somehow write or perpetuate something that will shift us to a mode of cooperation rather than competition as a way to deal with the Issues that the world is facing and then the Xytenia Yeah, therefore it is a representation of who you choose to be yet Yes, do you then assume as you have with the thing that perhaps did not excite you that this will support you as well You know and before you answer There is sometimes the tendency in your society for individuals who believe that something which does not excite them somehow has more power to provide that Financial type of support than something that does this is a belief there are actions then perform with that foundation of belief Which may make that seem like a reality, but that is only again the results of those actions So understanding that if what does not excite me supports me this much What does excite me must then support me that much more forward is that much more representation of who I am and you act that way with that Expectancy you will then demonstrate to yourself in no uncertain terms that what excites you can support you in no uncertain terms I guess the question that I have is this you know This is the only thing that's available even if it doesn't excite me is it the step that I should take no trusting And they'll bring me to my ultimate goal or what I'm Well, I think I'm given I have a little bit of money So I've got a little few months and I have to take the offer with this within this month And if I don't I'll have a few more months to look for something else and perhaps right the thing that I've wanted to do But haven't really done yet. Do I understand that what you are asking me is obviously completely up to you I can only say that in a similar situation faced with an alternative that Excited me and one that did not that I personally would trust the excitement But that again is completely up to you and again the issues that come into play is Your belief in what will support you and now that you are beginning to understand that excitement is a representation of who you are You may now begin to redefine then that obviously it will support you that much more directly or it would not be an obvious reflection of who you choose to be So therefore begin to entertain the notion that in as much as what does not excite you support you that What does excite will you will support you that much more and begin to look for how that is true? Not if it is true, but how it is true and how it expresses in your life your reality What I want to do is begin to manifest some way to be supported by my excitement And which requires taking action along those lines and I have one of the things that I wanted to do and haven't done yet Is writing the ideas that I have about economic reform down Really what I want to do is just share Love and stuff I've been doing it smaller that is all the magic and that is something that can simply be present in each moment Sharing of the unconditional love of yourself and others as well But in terms of what excites you again my particular choice in that aforementioned set of options would be to do What excites me beginning right now and beginning to allow what excites me to support me Notice the wording not forcing it to support me but allowing it to support me to whatever degree it will initially But having then the clear intention that it supports me in a manner that I so desire What delays me is questioning my ability to manifest the thing that excites me because when I sit there and look at the TV and get you know I do have ideas talking into my coast This is not how we could resolve some of these things and I say well wait a minute Who am I? But you understand on some level that what does not excite you can support So you already buy into an idea that something can support you now You can begin to entertain the notion that dovetailing yourself with who you prefer to be Obviously would support you to whatever level it will begin to support you and you accept the support to the degree that it comes Then you can allow that to expand but again, it isn't allowance. What excites you will support you if you let it The issue that I have is The thing is blocking me from acting on it. That's by the way There is no thing blocking you that assumes an external force You are simply not doing it one way the way you said it provides an excuse to continue not to do it What I am saying provides the opportunity to begin in this moment to follow your exciting Nothing blocks you but an assumption that something blocks you what I've been when I said something blocking me was unconscious police that seems to sneak up on me when I'm trying to The bar line is that they present themselves to your consciousness thus becoming conscious So simply allow them to do so in their timing trust that timing Continue to follow your excitement if you are so inclined and Allow your excitement to support you to the level and degree that it will that is a Representation of who you are and therefore the abundance that you read from it will in that sense be a multitude in this abundant The thing that I oh the thing Many that I wanted to in my excitement is to love myself and let go of the I guess the least I picked up in my childhood, but you are already doing that. Are you not? Yes, you are now perhaps in strobe like fashion But nevertheless Sometimes is that strobe on so you are expressing that self-love first Acknowledge that so that at least you can give yourself the credit you deserve then continue from this moment forward from the two options Expressing the belief of self-loathing or expressing the belief of self-love through action Again to perform the actions consistent with the self-love period very simple nothing is blocking Well Okay, could I use two examples then to illustrate one? Well, you can but I suggest as many examples as you have I will have something to say about Jim today and for the second time I saw this lady who I had a strongly negative reaction to more so than I've ever had to anyone else and it really confused me obviously didn't like it And I wondered it by some kind of effort experience nice that there's thinking thinking about it three weeks ago I was able to sit there and find peace by realizing that I felt Somehow she had anger at me or I felt somehow I had pleased or something like that and by centering myself and loving myself I was able to feel comfortable in a situation I didn't do as well today But I think what I the connection I made today is it's a it was a similar feeling though more conscious that I have towards my mother I think perhaps some anger why in that sense have you chosen not to speak to that individual providing you such a grandiose service The lady in the gym You have attracted that scenario your attention has been so placed for a reason It is not that she is the one extraneous thing in all creation and it is not That it is specifically her is not significant it is Therefore entertain the notion that part and parcel of this exploration though it is an exploration also of what you have shared is of your willingness to allow that individual to provide an opportunity for you to integrate that symbol so regardless of how you feel about your mother Your actions with this individual will be representative of the actions of an individual with self-love And the resolve that you will feel an intro acting with her will actually seem to have a retroactive effect To what you proceed to be the reaction from the mother for now You are exercising the option to do something about it where back then you did not Okay, therefore, thanks the symbol interact with the symbol dive into it I bring I bring that up like I've brought in enough Speaking with you before about my mother because having a critical mother it seems that I perpetuate the self criticism in which I want to let go of Let go do not criticize yourself as simple as that if you feel criticism coming up Allow the referential preferential you to provide the accompanying compliments to balance it out It is that simple it will always be up to you. What was example number two? Perhaps you did not view it that way But it was an opportunity to allow that individual's viewpoint to be valid and Not buying into his invalidation of your own therefore quite loaded with advantage By the way the moment that you felt the judgment from that individual You only felt it and only can feel your version of it. You did not feel the individual's Judgment the individuals mouth was moving words were coming out. Perhaps you can say with no inherent meaning You assign the meaning and assigned at the meaning had a particular Spin doing you created your reaction to that spin but that reaction was to your matching of that judgment a Wonderful opportunity again suggest that you thank the individual who did so and simply understand that individuals are entitled to their opinion If their opinion is different than yours They are still entitled to it And if you do not agree with what they are saying in criticizing you you will not feel anything And it will simply be a statement made by someone with no charge upon See I'm going to family unity and I'm going to see my mother there We don't want you proceed both these instances Left you with the opportunity to act Opportunity one act with the female individual opportunity to interact with the criticizing That is where you always can do something You will create a similar scenario With either the same or different individuals and this time we'll have a tendency toward Interacting with them diving into it. Well, this individual is here for a reason saying what they are saying for a reason I will interact with them assuming that they are here for a reason Therefore you have some homework perhaps you can say do you understand what I am saying To understand that nothing stops you from acting nothing prevents you nothing is blocking your actions and Those actions can be incident specific specific to that incident Someone speaks to you reminds you of your mother berating you speak to that individual not your mother your mother's not there Be here be now that individual is there for a reason your willingness to as you say grab they shall I say brass ring by the handle and Use what you have created as an obvious reflection of something that will allow you to integrate Parts within you that you still create a separate part allows you to move in any situation Nothing blocks you nothing stops you and from this moment forward I assume one of the options will be to interact with these individuals Interact In a way that kind of values they're right But also then allows you to assert to yourself into others who you are in a loving way Your feelings are hurt because you are matching their criticism first you forgive yourself not blame them When you forgive yourself it will be quite simple to interact with them And it will also be apparent upon forgiving yourself that they did nothing to you you did it all and therefore they provide in a service When you in perceiving you are judge match that judgment and feel judge and then forgive yourself and cease judging yourself You will feel appreciation toward the individual doing the judge Forgive yourself in the moment unconditional love means no conditions upon yourself either There's where nothing blocks you and from this point forward just decide Trust what you believe act as though you trust what you believe act act act move interact talk but I want to get married to have shoulders I've been afraid that I'm feeling trapped or I believe after a while. Well, you can't have it both ways So therefore understand that you are expressing the least which may be shall I say conflicted with each other and simply Make up your mind That is the degree of power that you have to decide your reality My fears that on development unconscious stuff will come up and work my consciousness well, yes Emotions will come up from beliefs which you unconsciously hold But when you ask yourself what must I believe to feel this and you say I must believe that the moment you say I must believe that It is no longer an unconscious belief You are now conscious of it and have allowed what used to be a miserable emotion in your way to deliver it to you Be willing to be that honest with yourself do not be afraid of what is in your subconscious Embrace and welcome it and then when it presents itself decide whether it is still representative of who you are or not But remember when you know what you believe it is no longer unconscious All right So I think the thing that the philosophy is residual stuff with my mother I'm the thing that blocks you is you and the definition that something blocks you Something your mother said to you years ago has no effect on you what so ever until You buy into that it does and create the effect through action That has nothing to do with what is actually going on you are using that as an excuse So simply allow yourself to release there is nothing there you are at ground zero You all are here and now is the only time there is in the here in the now You have everything you need Act or don't act that is all there is to it Do not blame your actions or your willingness or unwillingness to act on something in the past For the only thing that seems to create that relationship is you're blaming it on the path and then acting like the path has some effect on you So then yes, it seems to have that effect, but that's the only reason not because the past actually has that effect Okay, well I want to find somehow find peace in that relationship I'm gonna see in this week. Oh, I remind you Find the peace that exists within you There is no external to mope and no external peace It is internal to mope reflected outwardly internal peace reflected outwardly find the peace within you Interact with her from the center of that inner peace then you will recreate the definition of your relationship and Should she in that new definition feel the need to be critical? You will not buy into it. It will not affect you You will respond differently because you are acting like a person not affected. She will no longer have her feedback and She will no longer shall I say get satisfaction from the criticism which by the way Would only be so forthcoming from her to you? If she Criticizes herself to the same degree. So have the compassion for what she is creating to go through Rather than feeling the defensive Understand you are and have gotten this Allow it to sink in and allow your actions to reflect it then you will experience What I am saying rather than think about it. No need to thank me. However, you're welcome. I Thank you I have a question about actions and confusion I'd like to use an example how I do close a while back I was going on one car ride And I was looking in my closet what I was gonna wear and I was just still floused and I realized I had a belief that I couldn't wear So on a car ride because too many things could happen to it So I realized that and challenged it decided to choose the action of putting this thing on and going off on the day limit We proved reckless nothing fell on it Everything was going by the way even in the way that you are telling the phone you have set up an elaborate very sneaky Expectation But do proceeds and I was moving around Nice it felt and waiting for the axe to fall Went into this pet store and I'm standing there trying to see something on a high shelf now a person wishing to not Thank such a garment would they go into such a storm wait a minute? Store and I'm looking up I mean back to see something at a parrot What actually I'm probability that made it collapse that way it was the fluctuation of the shell I say beliefs expressed behind your action you did not consistently Express through actions of belief that in that sense all was fine And that simply you are who you are and you are who you are in that dress There was the undertone of the being extra careful and in that sense providing a form of subtle defense If I had been careful I wouldn't been within range of that parrot I was in casually re-elected Well in that particular moment, yes, but you had perpetuated a series of events each having its effect Okay, but the parrot what makes the parrot? Do that? Well simply that is the thing that you were attracted to show you What belief you are truly expressing in that moment though? You may have said you are expressing another belief You do by the way understand what I am saying and you do understand that there was an undertone of perhaps you can say uncertainty I'm trying to understand the mechanics of it what What actually happens that makes the parrot do something like that What is what it's a thought we're talking about not an action for staying well again animals are simply Reflecting consciousness and are not as disconnected as you would normally shall I say believe in your society So therefore it simply provided the service in exactly the perfect timing and perfect scenario Okay, another example more now understand Due to the fact that you have created that symbol that even literally that particular symbolic animal mimics and Mirrors back to individuals things that they are in that sense expressing yes Yes, so therefore you use that symbol in a less verbal way, but still in the same form that it presents itself Let me take a more serious example Serious all right Chooses one person over another the person may go to bed that night and lock the door of the same The same action as the name of next door. Why is that person chosen? If the actions the same what is that the bottom line is what you are sharing is Hypothetically and it is a what is rather than a what is? There are as many Different explanations as individuals in this sense Perhaps what will as a blanket cover this particular area is just the idea that again Expressing of fear setting up a defense Is in that sense indicative of the fact that you believe in attack to be most imminent? This applies to both examples that you have shared Okay, but maybe another people on that same street Block that door that I'm trying to understand you have said you will not you are by the way pondering of what is And not understanding the individuals involved their particular shall I say Expression of their beliefs their particular beliefs in their own shall I say Relationship to what you call karma and so forth. There are many of these Parameters in place and it becomes again very hypothetical The bottom line is do you wish for that to happen to you? No, do you feel that that is most likely hardly do you fear it? momentarily it sounds Simply do not act when you fear it Allow yourself to glean from the fear what you are believing in that moment and only act when you are centered Well, I know you will not be one of the individuals to attract such an experience even if neighbors on both sides Well in a sense perhaps you would not refer to it so much as telepathy as simply the interconnectedness of all beings on a fundamental level So everything simply through to synchronicity orchestrates itself into place according to the beliefs emotions thoughts and actions of those involved and The specifics again are so variable that it would be a disservice to make an overall Statement about the reason in that particular scenario and again provide a service to simply remind you that defense is Assumption of an attack which is the same as saying you believe that will happen So watch where you are being defensive versus simply being the person who expresses themselves in that dress Do you understand I think I'm still wrestling with this Something under an action contributing to why that people are then occurred that way ultimately not now I understand that it may in that sense seem that there are mitigating factors But understand that those mitigating factors only could be in place as results of certain actions Now also understand that many if not most individuals upon your planet do not have a sense of the Structure that we are discussing the least emotion thought and action and simply perform actions In what you would proceed to be an automatic fashion without any of the underlying understanding or examination You are now at the level to simply not be an automaton Does this help or is there still something that you are seeking? Thanks, oh it's so pleased in that sense to share all right. Thank you. I thank you as well. Hey female I'd like to just Ask the question because basically I just like to make contact with you We already had but do proceed on verbal level. Oh, yeah There is a situation in which I've been placed what has been I've been placed at home where someone has moved on to our property without our permission and This is a relative who seems to be not very stable at the moment and the question is about action in regards to this for myself I feel that There is certain action that could be taken to remove her at the same time that the feeling that to do so would cause Her perhaps more harm and maybe even us to the extent that you know We might feel some sense of responsibility in that she does not seem to be Very logical at this point. Oh, but that is her choice and your consideration is what is your choice Does it excite you in that sense to go habitate with this individual or not now if it does fine If it does not then it then becomes a matter of will you be honest? Will you in a loving way you are loving individual with the understanding of unconditional love? trust what you are feeling and Share with that individual understanding that you are feeling it not only because it is of service to you But has to be of service to her as well or she would not have attracted it continuing to as you say Say what she wishes to hear allows her to have elaborate elaborate conversations with herself Where your gift gets interjected is where you perhaps have a different point of view Feeding her what she already believes again as a reinforcement of what she believes and again a form of talking to oneself Allowing your unique perspective to stand out because it is unique is Actually more of a service to the individual than Yesing them allowing them to speak to themselves They have attracted you for a reason if you are willing to express who you are all Can see that reason if you in that sense are yesing them No one in that sense is that obviously aware of the reason? So number one is to trust what you are feeling and understanding that you are a loving individual who does not have the desire to hurt anyone But perhaps understanding that sometimes when you enable someone to remain Disabled you perpetuate their own cycle of disability You may understand that you can have compassion for her, but need not feel sorry for her the difference being that you know She has her power and you know that her choices are her sovereign choices and treat her with that respect But not through the denial of who you are For that is not an integrated home Do you understand I totally agree so then the challenge becomes Communicating through unconditional love and then trusting that if you feel you have done so whatever happens Obviously must be to a benefit of all because anything born of unconditional love can only in that sense be a reflection of that intention intention yes the unconditional love is something that I've been working with in regards to myself and You know, I may not have reached quite the point where in my feelings of feeling You know anger or whatever it might be negative feelings and I can't be able to express unconditional love in terms of Well expressing unconditional self love is simply a matter of when you create what you call self anger and judgment to simply Be willing to create forgiveness It is all right to feel whatever you feel you need not invalidate yourself for feeling it But if an invalidation is created be willing to forgive yourself for the invalidation And that is the expression in that circumstance of unconditional love once you forgive yourself and express that self-love Then it will only reflect in your external communications with others as well So use the opportunities of judgment again as opportunities to transform that judgment use even the judgment When you judge another individual again, I remind you that there is some self judgment involved So if you look at where the issues are relating to you specifically and play through that dialogue through that You will generally find new information in which to assist you in making the loving communication Yes at the moment the communication is not very open there is no chance to communicate well There is always a chance and it is always up to you to in that sense manifest The opportunity and advantage simply in any given moment What's available is it now available to speak to her if you ask yourself that you will find often the answer is actually yes Now am I not willing to speak to her that will be up to you But reminding yourself of the unconditional love reminding yourself that your feeling Is not the one extraneous thing that slipped in in creation will assist you in getting in touch with and Expressing those feelings you also then get to look at the beliefs that you have about why you are having those feelings If it is simply because you know you are enabling her to remain disabled then you will perhaps have a Firmarational for proceeding in love and life Yeah Well, I do trust in the timing of what's happening Oh But do not create the perpetuation that you do not have the ability to communicate for you do in every moment Thank you for that. I have been taking you back seat on this thinking that I was not the best one to communicate And maybe I haven't been up until This point from this point on well, I am just giving you your license. You may now drive Oh For everything and for assisting the channel Shady Well individuals call things whatever they wish But if you have the best interest of an individual in mind that will show through somewhere in the process I Have a question on something else that you The other side of the room She said that someone would see picked out and brings or a softest and It's my opinion that you put out a vibration And someone will pick up on that vibrate It's just you But it is on a mat it is though you have in that sense three holes of differing sizes and you roll a ball That will only fit in one hole and it's simply automatic There is no matching up. There is no sending out as you say signals Synchronicity always in that sense delivers what an individual in that sense creates in their wire So that victim that that chucks the door lock that all up is really acting like a victim well again It will depend on the specifics in general. Yes I have a question about Something that I was reading Yesterday it's a book of my shard and He spoke of the triads in the triads before you proceed for now Allow us to remain grounded Grounded to your reality Grounded to the happenings and circumstance of your earth if you feel Cellar connections explore them through the knowingness of your consciousness However remain grounded to what you can do Thank you, I like to share something very beautiful My wife is not keen on my participation In this work. Oh why the mixed knowledge? And especially Saturday night Be with her Saturday night. I must not love her Well what perhaps you will be able to explain to her that you will have the next few Saturdays free However tonight She Came in I was getting ready to come here and she said are you are you not going? You're staying home with me tonight. I could know She says you know I would normally ask you or blame you or choose you a lot of things But tonight I understand that you want to do that and I believe it's for the best But she wish me well, I told me she loved me now Three days ago that To allow her to be who she is you will find Reciprocity you will find that allowance from her new proceeds I I we were having difficulties in our marriage for the last two weeks and we both expressed Feeling separation Separate or leave or whatever and I answer used the technology that we're learning here And I asked myself a last resort Oh What is it that I'm doing that I'm creating And in my answer was that I was not loving her well I was there is not the unconditional love of Yourself and her to be quite technical now. I am not saying you never unconditionally love yourself Yes, you do but I am speaking of consistency. That's true, but do you proceed? So so these are all the negatives that I felt She felt and we were we were at a Until I did Unconditional love for her And it came right back to me always will always no matter what and if you are so receptive Deceptive you will see no matter what the outer actions of an individual are you will see that love not only that But judgment Judgment I was judging the things that she did the way she did them and then wondering why is she judging me? Yes, I Miracles to Miracles are the rule not the exception. So it's beautiful Tonight we have a we have a midnight serious plan And it only blooms one night The flower will come out and tomorrow morning It's a heat so we have four flowers no need tonight Congratulations many things other than the simple physical flower are blossoming Simply allow yourself to continue in that sense to provide the light provide the love and that will be all the fertilizer You will meet Thank yourself. I thank you as well I'm Greeting and I have a couple of questions the first one is some time ago someone said to me that thing I Don't cause things to happen thing happen to me and that is one perspective and When you buy into that you can create an overwhelming Apparency of this I need not tell you The symbol of service creeping around Into it to be more assertive about things that I want and I need I'm trying to be more assertive things that I prefer Something happened to me on Thursday. I was wondering if you had some insight into it I Have when I spoke to the last time I told you I've been ill I had pneumonia and I'm feeling very down and very draggy and on Thursday Almost out of a clear blue-style. I've been feeling gradually better. I had like this incredible surge of energy Incredible surge of energy. I don't know where it came from. I haven't felt that good in years But you are expressing yourself more fully which is Interjecting it came from you. Where else is there for it to come from? Simply revel in the degree of ecstasy that you contain and understand whatever you feel comes from you Do not look for an external source Pat yourself on the back and rejoice for the choice to create the positive experience I think it was my choice to create it at that time. No, I know Now albeit perhaps perceived by you as an unconscious choice, but the moment you felt it it became conscious I Assume you are excited about Then you will continue to create it with more consistency now that you are owning its source as yourself All right, I have a question for you from my daughter She is taking for spec writing lessons and doing so provided you the very side of the bad days We very well this past week. She was going to a camp for our four hours a day five weeks of our student for hours a day for five days and She became ill and she missed most of it and she wanted to know what she had done To cause that or what had happened that she became ill and couldn't do something that she really wanted to do and that really Well, what will be who for in this exploration is focusing her attention in the proper place Rather than in that sense exploring why something was prevented from happening Explore what did happen and what did creating that actually force her in that moment seemingly force her to look at That is the point Then when she looks at what that symbol forced her to look at if she is willing to continue to look at that Consciously willing to dive into it when it comes up there will no longer be the need to create a symbol to seem to force her to look at it So my simple suggestion would be a Acknowledge her power in the creation of that symbol. This is a reflection of strength not weakness for an individual to create that type of experience and B again allow it to be obvious What did it force her to do not what did it prevent her from doing? What did it force her to look at not what did it prevent her from looking at? After these questions allow her to function as the creator of her reality and certain surprising aspects will arise We say daughter dear While you were sick what did being ill force you to do be blunt they are intelligent and And perhaps will embrace what you are saying more readily than you are assuming Do it do not try it trying is simply the doing of trying not the doing of the thing Be less tentative and dive into and do all right. Yes. Thank you very much. Thank you as well over there I Know it because if you and your kind could So how change and to form like a human being Well, we already exist in a form that you would find similar to your own You would again perceive us as having a head having two arms a body two legs and so forth Though we are a bit shorter on the average than your general height in your society We are on average generally five feet in height now understand We do not see each other physically because of differences in how we create our flow of time but making or shall I say creating certain Adjustments in that flow which we understand we can do and therefore do it and Were we? To synchronize with your time frame you would perceive us as beings much as yourself Although with some differences again the males have no hair our head may seem to be slightly Larger in proportion to our body than the typical human but in many ways in what you call clothing Perhaps with what you call a hack you may not notice much of a difference Would perhaps perceive us as being somewhat foreign perhaps oriental so to speak But would appear quite similar to you so it is not that we have no bodies and that to Interact with you we create bodies. No, we already have bodies They vibrate differently than your own so you do not perceive them if we change or shift that vibration you would see us Does that make sense? Yeah? Does that answer your question? Pretty much. Thank you very much for when I've been asking questions for listening to me Very good. Well, thank you for the honor of your willingness to share with me for as I have always maintained Consistently throughout these interactions. I get something out of this and each unique individual that shares Who they are with me and allows me to know that much more about you about them Allows me because I know everything is within me to know that much more about myself So I thank you for the valuable service that you have done for me as well And to you There will be but a few moments remaining to this interaction Okay Andrew and curious as to whether there was any young Other some volunteer in the chair about the co-created action that And you had my Session that raised the about a oh Oh, I'll wait and while referring to when the chair had in that sense turned 180 degrees. I Was wondering when you'd ask There are basically two reasons from my perspective that this was created Number one it was in that sense a direct symbol that you have all come Bolsker number two it allowed me to function temporarily as part of the audience and therefore Provided a style of identification for All right Do understand that many of you are literally in your lives Since interacting with us not because of us but because of your own willing is literally Turned your lives around 180 degrees Facing now toward the direction representative of who you choose to be Great enough Very often I've been struck when listening to tapes from these sessions That when you talk about preference you use the terminology What one says what what one says one prefers versus simply saying what one prefers I'm wondering why you use what you've had that word says we are referring to the fact that generally and many times Your actions are not representative of what you are saying you prefer So therefore if you prefer it do it if you are not doing it you simply say that you prefer So we point out that distinction does that make sense? Yes, it does other question I have is What when you talk about actions? Would you include things like meditation as being an action? Only in the lucid sense for that is a tapping in which you will in that sense Perhaps you can say develop or express into wishing develop or express inside It is representative of turning within but in a physical world where it becomes practical is Taking that insight that intuition that inspiration and applying it to your life So as perhaps you can say the part of the action the receptive Phase or the female phase of the action tuning in is all well and good But if you simply stop there in your physical reality nothing moves So it is part and parcel of your Recentivity of your info, but any complete action will always be the combination of receptivity and doing that So in general then an action has some physical component in general now again the sitting down the In that sense creating the time is an action But the insights that you receive more often than not are something that you can act upon and since you have derived that Inspiration from within acting upon it will have a profound effect on your life Okay So it is half of the process of the student okay third question in regards to intentions of Which you would you recommend intending something as on physical as? being reaching a joyful state is that that is an example of something that When you maintain it as a clear intention again Vibratorily sets up the reality to allow you to express But you understand that joy is something you can choose to express as well in any given moment Calls and effects are quite loose in your reality though You assume the cause always comes first if you create however the effect first Understanding the looseness of that connection then you can create the causes so as an example Expressing your happiness That particular effect Simply because you say so because that is who you are Then allows the reality to create the causes for that happiness Last question is if if I Clearly intended to be able to fly and I jumped out this window Would I if I believe that I could fly would I fly or would I drop like a rock? Put it this way Were you to jump out that window? believing you could fly and fly and For but one moment be surprised You would then fall and understand you did not truly believe In that sense understand there are certain math agreements and it is not that you cannot Recreate or renegotiate your relationship with that agreement, but you have made those math agreements in general for specific Reasons you have placed these parameters in place for specific reasons not for what it bars you from doing For what it allows you to do in that frame So such a thing is possible, but it is my perception that it is unlikely that you fully enough Believing to have the successful result Carry that into That fact or those facts into other areas and say that in general it might be good idea to practice prudence in Pursilling new things well that is something completely different in general that is a hesitation with an underlying doubt or trust in the thing that you don't prefer That is the choice if you believe in who you are and act Accordingly you dive into what you are doing and this would then not appear to be such prudence in that sense But would appear to be perhaps in your slang down home As to you as well at this time allow me to in a sense Though this is not an ending in the final sense It is perhaps the completion of one particular phase or cycle of our interacting with you to end And so to speak where we began and that is with a question or sharing or statement from Cecil Now before you proceed Understand when we began to interact with your society through this channel you asked the first question the question that you asked Was in that sense to define what we mean by vibration personal vibration Allow me now to enhance my answer to you Vibration for the purposes of practicality Would be the rate at which your consciousness flashes as a stroke as you are less aware it flashes perhaps you can say slower or with Less of a frequency as you are more aware the on time so to speak that this colloquial the flash time Increases thereby raising your frequency raising your vibration When you deny who you are in a sense the effect is to punch holes and create less of a frequency of the on time Each of the on flashes are willingness to be who you are each of the awkward represent your denials as you begin in that sense to acknowledge who you are You smooth out that vibration you are on so to speak this is colloquial most or all of the time thereby expressing an increased frequency a higher vibration and an expanded awareness What is your request of me Simply is there something that you wish to share or ask in? allowing this particular interaction to complete Well going back to the point you started with I personally feel that I'm vibrating at a much higher frequency being a way I will independently confirm this You are and you are seen that much more brightly as all of you are by us not that that matters Not that we are someone to in that sense strive to have the favor of now But simply you are living your reality Well given my electrical engineering background My question to you originally had to do with frequency sign you soil vibration and all that I was coming and we had shared that even pictorially what you would call a Spival adds the third dimension to that particular pictographic representation what I am now sharing is the aspect of In that sense the on time of the flashing of your consciousness Okay, I don't feel like there are many voids in my vibration because I'm Usually aware just about all the time of the now and I'm enjoying the now. I'm not dwelling in the past I'm not worrying about the future. I'm really exploiting the moment And following my statement pretty well, I think at what frequency would represent no void Well in that sense as you remain physical to some degree there will be gaps When you in that sense expand to a certain degree it is no longer able to be and this is colloquial But it will have to do contained within a physical reality And then there would seem to be a smoother presentation in that Well, this is one Closing thought that I have here. It's that the appreciation of self That the key to our life experience revolves around emanates from our self-love and without that We're impotent in terms of really enjoying the opportunities of joy in this life without that self-confidence and self-love We are crippled and an awareness of that and an appreciation of that. I thank you very much. Thank you Oh, I thank you as well At this timing Allow me to simply thank all of you and express my unconditional love and appreciation to all of you Clarifying your vision determining what it is that excites you Clarifying the definitions that one has that you already hold and the definitions you would need to hold to in that sense live your vision vision Clarifying the fact that you deserve clarifying your desire what you feel All that is simply then necessary is Action it's your life Live it in the way that you deserve a life of ecstasy a life of joy a life of expansion a life of growth When next we interact You will in that sense have developed the results of what we share and on that level and only that level Will we continue to interact? We thank you once again and for the first time for the gift that you bequeed to us in interacting with us and in In allowing yourself to boldly express who you are That is the only way that you become bright enough to be seen and what is attracted to you? Will always be the vibration of what you are being you always get the reality you are the vibration of Therefore if unconditional love light positivity integration are your vibration that is all you can experience and Negativity will simply be a fleeting awareness of the exploration of someone else I Thank you for the honor of interacting with you in this way And I bid you a most fond and loving life dream and dream lives And I thank you
