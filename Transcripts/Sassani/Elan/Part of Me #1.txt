 Greetings this evening of your time, how are you? Thank you very much. Allow me to begin this interaction with the entitlement part of me. Allow us to begin. Very often when individuals begin to explore, expanding their consciousness, begin to explore the idea that they just may deserve to create a life with integrity according to their preference, according to their excitement. Many issues very often will rise to the surface. These issues give you the opportunity to look at things that perhaps you have stored in your unconscious. The looking at these things obviously then makes it quite conscious and this allows you to then change you. One of the ideas we wish to highlight this evening is something that comes up again when you do begin to expand, when you do begin to consciously begin to define yourself. And this takes the form very often of seemingly conflicting bits or parts of you. Very often individuals who simply say, well, part of me believes this, perhaps the thing that you prefer to believe, and the other part of me believes something else. Perhaps again what you do not prefer. And very often individuals will create this in the form of what you sometimes label a quandary and allow a particular paralysis for they feel that they are indeed divided up into these parts that are diametrically opposed, very creative. Understand however that there is another way to look at it as there is another way to look at anything. And that is by redefining when you feel that there are parts of you at odds, that rather than perceiving them as divisions as parts are, perceiving them as choices or options within you. Even your willingness to change the wording changes the perspective, and rather than there being again parts playing a tug of war with your consciousness. You may simply understand that now that you have defined them as choices rather than discrete parts of you, that this now presupposes that you can choose between them and understand that you can. Now we have discussed many times the idea that the ultimate truth is composed of all truths. So therefore all choices within you are true. So it is not a matter of you being able to figure out which choice is true for they are both truths. And were you willing to assume either one of those positions or choices, you will then emotionally feel that that is true within its own framework. But what we are suggesting is that the other parts, the other choice is just as true. So first of all equalizing these parts, redefining them as choices and then equalizing those choices, not wishing to escape or get rid of one of them, but simply defining what they are. The form of defining what they are allows us to bring into place another aspect that we have discussed with you. That being the tool of your imagination. For we have discussed many times that your personality is composed of a prism that breaks down the white light of infinite creation and the three sides that comprise this prism is the belief emotion and thought. Therefore you can understand that any choice within you is a belief and therefore generates an emotion, generates thought patterns. And based on the foundation of these beliefs, emotions and thoughts, generates particular actions which then support that truth, which then allow you to experience that truth at the seeming exclusion of all other truths. Therefore this applies as well to these choices within you. One of the things that will enable you to define them and consciously decide between them is utilizing your imagination in a way that we have shared before. Sitting down perhaps when you have some time and can relax and isolate yourself, center yourself. Simply begin, we suggest at first with the more negative or least preferred choice. Sit down, state that choice, state the position of that part of you, that belief system. While you are stating it, allow the corresponding emotion as it automatically always will to muster up, to build up within you and truly feel how having that perspective, making that choice, being that part, using the old terminology of you, feels. How it truly feels. Now in general, since we are discussing at first doing the left preferential choice, that emotion will be a heavy, perhaps negatively interpreted emotion. You can then very easily extrapolate what thoughts would then come to your mind and again subsequently what actions you would then take having that choice. But the point is to state the idea. Feel how it feels. Truly allow yourself to complete, read, feel that emotion. Do not squelch it. Allow the belief to generate the emotion, but then feel, experience, be that emotion. Notice the thought that are then corresponding and notice what actions you would be inclined to take. When choosing that particular non preferred perspective. Died into it. Allow yourself to be that idea. Allow yourself to truly discover the results, the emotional, the thought pattern and the action results of that particular perspective or belief. When you have completed this, evaluate how you feel about it. Then, after you have blanked out the canvas, the screen of your imagination. Allow yourself to now state the preferred choice. The choice you really wish you were. But state it as fast. As though you already are. If you need to utilize the terminology, make the leave. When you do allow the corresponding emotions to then be created from the new preferred belief. They will again in general be a lighter emotion, a more energizing emotion and will then corresponding read, generate thoughts. And again, through your imagination, extrapolation, a set of actions. Truly allow yourself to now feel how that feels. When you are through doing that and have established the actions of the preferred you. Now, compare. For again, it is not that one has any more weight than the other. Your willingness to play them both out equally. Allows you to interpret and assign them as equal and thereby gives you equal access to them. When you create the new emotions, compare them to the other emotion. Which do you prefer? Understand that you have not moved from your seat. And yet you have created a plethora of responses by simply stating one belief and then stating another. This equalizes it and in that sense lays it all out on the table and you get to choose from that table. It perhaps will then not be very difficult to make a choice for in general individual prefer the lighter, more positive, more energizing, more exciting emotion. When you give yourself the advantage of seeing what the actions would be with one set of beliefs versus the other, it is also then not difficult at all to simply decide which set of actions are more reflective of your preference. And the way that you choose again having equally acknowledged both the way that you then manifest the choice that you prefer is by again viewing the actions from the new choice act that way. And that is all it takes. You have now integrated what you have formally defined to be part of yourself. You have rendered them to choices and you have simply chosen not having gotten rid of the choice you do not prefer but acknowledged it and simply chosen something else. This is integration. This is transformation for mating if you will. A new point of view according to preparets. Now very often when this occurs one of the issues that may again come up is your inherent feeling, your inherent opinion if you will about your own worthiness about your own deserve the villain. We remind you that the universe supplies anything to you that you truly believe you deserve. So therefore if the issues again of deserve ability of worthiness do come up take the opportunity to remind yourself of the unconditional love of all that is for it is simply constant. It is eternal and it is infinite and no matter how you feel about yourself you are always being an extension of creation being an expression of creation itself. Always unconditionally loved by creation or creation simply does not forsake any part of itself by definition. It applies that unconditional love to itself. You to have any ability being made in the image and likeness of all that is to also inwardly reflect your own willingness to remove the conditions from yourself to love yourself. Because all that is sets up the mold sets up the templates always in that sense in parts to you that unconditional love by simply reminding yourself of it and allowing yourself to then feel it which can be quite overwhelming in a positive way. You can always then mimic that vibration. You can always then realize that nothing is held from you and perhaps again the issue is what you feel you deserve. But again we remind you you needed to do nothing to exist even in your own society upon being born you are showered with gifts from the society. You did nothing but simply come into physicality and are already showered with gifts by the universe. Therefore you need not earn this idea it is your birth right absolutely. Therefore for your willingness to utilize of the many choices available to you interacting with us interfacing with us. We thank you and also express to you our unconditional love and appreciation for the gift of your sharing for the gift of your consciousness for your willingness to begin to understand that loving yourself. Your self infinitely now enables you to love all others and the style and the form which you choose to love yourself will create your ability to love others. Therefore if you wish to increase your love to others you wish to increase your love and service to others do so with integrity to yourself. You and they are all an extension of one event one thing all that is nothing is left out. Therefore your willingness to treat it that way will then in a sense allow you to feel that you fit in as well for you. For your willingness to expand and explore your consciousness and choose of the choices available interacting at the back of doors of your civilization with us. I ask you now how may I be of service to you. Hey I have a couple of questions for you. I'll write an observation but I guess internalize the question. My first question is during Brown and Democratic presidents seem to be gaining a lot of support every day in the United States primaries. Will he win the Democratic Convention in July of 92. Now now now. You have interacted with us to know that it is our understanding that it is your plan that any prediction we might render is simply a sense and even the understanding of the prediction can then change it. Shall we say symbolically which is how we prefer to interact then allowing you to draw your own conclusion. That particular representation to us simply symbolizes individuals willingness to change to transform the system that you have created into more of a representation of who you are of who you wish to be. And in taking back individually your own power you now wish that the representation of your own power also be an empowered representation. So therefore symbolically speaking that is our sensing of that. It seems like people on the United States seem to be taking back their own power very very quickly. It is not exclusive to your country but yes. Right. For us it seems to be one of the last rounds on the earth where it's starting to happen in Russia. So for myself it seems to have already gone through that transformational process for us continually going through it. And I think we're just starting to evolve through that process in terms of our politics. But there is the ability due to the way that your system is structured to literally transform it without it collapsing. Now again it is possible anything is possible but it is also as possible to transform it utilizing the advantages that it set up. My second question is recently a TV show called Now I Can Be Cold. One to area 51 in Nevada which is an area supposedly where there are a couple of spacecrafts that are being tested. And there was hold of a new hangar, new hangars that were built on the secret area where it contained possibly nine holly advanced flying spacecraft. Do you tell us what's going on at hangar 51 at this time? Our perception is that there is some accuracy to this idea and that any technology that has been received by your society from extraterrestrial sources shall we say. You'll still always have the limitations of understanding that you cannot separate consciousness from these ideas. So therefore until individuals realize that they are directly linked with the technology and continue to view that technology as simply hard wear. There will only be the limited application of the technology. Well this limited application of technology is that could that be considered the possibility of eliminating and telling those top secret people that are at this hangar 51 area, not allowing the public or general scientists and others who do not have that. That is the choice of your own societies, not the extraterrestrial civilization. And the form of the limitation so to speak is perhaps you can say that they can get them to fly but not very far. And in a sense have not entered space itself with them. Maybe I need a few of us in this room to help them out a little bit. Well I might have a third question here. The people in the United States seem to be taking their empowerment back this year. And just this week our speaker of the House of the US House of Representatives was asked to step down because of the current political upheaval in our nation's capital. It seems as if our political power base for the US is falling apart quickly. No one's forming which in a sense by your own definition. Generally again by your own definition requires a slight tearing down before there is a build up. But one of the primary issues are accountability. And one of the primary reasons that this now becomes more obvious to individuals is the expansion of your ability to communicate your media. Do proceed. What events can we look forward to before our presidential election and will be a mass discontent of our people or awakening now taking place to affect the outcome of our future year? Question number two, the answer is yes. Question number one is that you will see forms, dribs and drabs utilizing the language of information being quote unquote leaked about the existence of such ideas. You have mentioned this most likely be our last presidential election. Is that correct? There is some likelihood behind that idea. For now we will stand behind it but nothing again is etched in stone. And that is more than anything, a symbolic representation of the taking back of your individual power and not needing to empower a particular single individual to do so. So it is possible. Okay well our current president keeps talking about this new world order. Can you define what the president means by his new world order and I say his versus the new world order or the new world that we are all talking about here in these interactions? From our particular understanding and again it is only our perspective. That particular terminology new world order is generally meant America is the ball which perhaps is not the perspective of all the other countries. So therefore you can understand that our particular suggestions are the leaning toward global unitization not a subtle shall we say very fancy flick form of domination. Is there a certain grouping of people involved in this so-called new world order that I say our current president? It is far more an idea, a concept at this point than a reality. There are individuals perhaps you can say in place in case it goes that far but it is not shall we say very well defined at this point. Who came about with the idea of a new world order? There are particular individuals who are shall we say in association with each other including your president. So it is sort of a decision made basically from the top down. In a sense. You want privy to the decision making process? Well you are openly yes. For your awareness of it then allow you to take whatever actions or whatever feedback you wish. Okay, I have one other comment. Tuesday night around 7.30 p.m. I saw a beautiful light just shoot across the sky. I was going to a friend's house and I think it was just a shooting star or a meteor. Can you expand on this order? Our perception is that it was an atmosphere with a code. Hey. There is certain electron activity that has been infused artificially by members of your civilization. You witness such shall we say inside of it. Alright, that is interesting. We think so. I would thank you for your chance. Thank you. Shut it. Hey. A company has approached me and my partners to buy us out and have me work for them as a manager. And how does that feel? Basically I don't like change. Can I trust my feelings that this move would be concrete to my makeup and not give me the substance and freedom that I require? Perhaps you can say you can trust your feelings if you can define why you have them. Do you have them out of a sense of insecurity or is it your intuition and heart apart speaking to you? Also understand that it is quite inconvenient in your reality to in that sense this light change or change is the only concept. If I decide against this buyout will my partner support me in my decision? That will be up to him. But the real question is will you support yourself in that decision? And in that way we suggest self reflecting, looking at how you truly feel, looking at what issues come up again surrounding in security, handling them and then running it through again and seeing how you feel. If you feel that this will facilitate you and enable you to do what it is you wish, go right ahead. If you feel that it will squelch your ability to express who you are then in that sense you may wish to a friend. Would I be wise in bringing in new partners to replace my old ones and will that allow me the freedom and success that I'm seeking? That is one possibility and our simple suggestion would be to be sure that you are synchronized in intention. Discuss what your clear intention or vision is and if there is agreement with it then that is a very high likelihood. Is synchronization that when you say to another word, go through the views or? Well in other words in presenting your viewpoint if they are the same viewpoint as the others they are thinking of. Well they're not saying they can't be synchronized because each one of the partners is coming from a different direction. I eat one chooses to retire one wants to semi retire. Yes, you have discussed the in-flushing of new partners and what we are suggesting again is that you simply share the same intention. OK, thank you for now. And you should. Great. I'm sure that you are saying that our presence is not the result of our path and that each child. And that each child. It's very intentionally speaking. I mean virtually it is not the results of the path and then we internalize and leave it and live it. You will be free. You will break the connection to third density and be walking in fourth. I want to know really what that means. Can I break connections in third density? You can transform into fourths again not breaking away or escaping from third. But one of the things that keeps you very rigidly within third is the idea that you create a causal relationship with the past. Again, we remind you you only ever experientially exist in the now moment. The now moment is the only time that ever exists. When you speak of the past in a particular now moment, you are recreating a perception of a past in the now moment and then to whatever degree you empower it. Perhaps you can say use it as an excuse. You then create the effect of it being a result of that path. But your willingness to understand that every now moment is a complete package is a complete kit. And that any notions you have of the past are simply recreations in that present. Freeze you up and allows you to make decisions based on what it is you wish to do, not using something unpreparential in your past as an excuse to hold yourself back. My question is breaking connections in third. What does it actually mean? Am I going to be able to enjoy experiencing third density? Would I be seeing it from a fourth density perspective? In a sense, yes, you would be third transitional fourth, still able to interact in third, but living, shall we say, a fourth density attitude, and that attitude brings along with it. An ecstatic explosion of coincidence delivering to you all the things you prefer, allowing you to function in tandem, in line, in step with your purpose, with your excitement. And therefore, the experience of your world is more like into what you sometimes call heaven on earth. So it is not that you will disappear into the void now. You will, in that sense, be a fourth density representation or example upon your planet. Thank you very much. Thank you to you for your willingness to transform and to, in that sense, begin to choose to step in line with your purpose. Is that all? I'm glad we did. Thank you. I'm glad we did. I was writing down my question tonight. I suddenly realized that all three of them, coincidentally, had to do with the same period of my life when I was about 12 or 13. And the first question I wanted to ask you about, at that time in the early 50s, my dad was very much interested in extraterrestrial activity and this kind of thing. And in our camp at Millenock at Lake of the Maine, clustered in the snow under the window with these strange little prints about two concentric circles, one about three inches across and one very small that was deeper in the center with radiating lines coming out from it. It looked like somebody had been standing there looking in the window, but there was no trail going anywhere else. So they found another cluster in an open place and another cluster down by the lake, which he took pictures of, but he didn't send them to any authorities or anything in the airport because he was afraid to never get them back and all those kind of things. At the same time that this was happening, I remember being in my room in our house and seeing something dark go over him, or it became dark over him. And with a lot of static electricity, none of the clocks and radios or anything would work right, and then it lasted for about five minutes to go and then was gone. And at that also thing, when I was telling a friend of mine about my father's footprint, she said, well, she said, don't you know that there are extraterrestrial walking around on New York right now? They look exactly like human beings. Her name was Janice Penny, I remember, and I just wondered what were the footprints? Will you again describe that? Yes, they look like the outer circle was about three inches across. They were circular. Yes. With a smaller ring on the inside that would deeper down into the snow. We understand. And then there were radiating lines coming out from a star from the center. This is, shall we say, the result of a particular style of probe. It was not classically speaking footprint. And it was, shall we say, a valid event of extraterrestrial origin. Now I have a few feet. Are Canadian most likely? They are literally lineage-seeking incarnationally, your brothers, sisters, and cousins. You have common origins throughout the multi-book. Are they walking around in human form? I mean, could I eat one on the street in order to look back like me? If you were to meet one on the street, they would look very similar to you. However, they do not, in general, walk around on your street. They have not infiltrated your planet. They, in that sense, have other things to do. What was the probe for? To establish a particular connection in terms of your perception of it, and from their perspective, observation and recallability. I have a more question. I have just a new friend, Terry, who told me that at age 16, right along the shoreline, Madison and Clinton, she and her friend had gone to the beach. And on their way home in the car, it suddenly became very dark. All over the top of the car, they stopped and they looked out each side of the window, and hovering right above them was a huge spaceship. And it was round. She said we clear lights all around it and was moving silently with no sound between the trees. And they turned the car around and tried to follow it back towards the beach. And I just wondered where they might be from. Well, again, this is 3-8 years. Yes, and again, a valid project. How is that a postcard? Is your call it for her or...? In a sense, it was a postcard both ways. It established a connection, but again only to the degree that she is willing to look at it. And what is of now of interest to her, her willingness to embark upon exploring it, will be most helpful and enabling her to go the next step. Because she has a new friend, Pat, who evidently is organizing groups that are studying in the area. And I just wondered if she and I had any connection because of this whole thing. It is up to you, but it can be. Thank you very much. Thank you. Oh, good night. Hi, Ron. Great evening. Oh, great one. Thank you for the introduction. Thank you for your willingness to receive it. How was that? Oh, I just thought you might... I had the thought when you were sharing with us in the introduction that we had, there was some sort of community exercise to share with us as a group. I had a feeling it was leading up to some kind of notice and exercise that you could share with us. In this particular evening, no. However, stay tuned. There are, shall we say, other things on the agenda this evening? Okay. I had a couple questions. One is, I had talked to you about energy and reiaja. And I got some information that we were creating. There are connections to pliabia. It would not be accurate to say directly pliabia. What is this energy direction? If we are synchronized to what you are intending to share, you may. And when you left, what happened? In a sense, if again, we are sharing a common idea. He simply laid down the groundwork for what you labeled, your Jesus. In a sense, you may say sex the stage. And after you physically left the planet, what happened in the transformation? What you would understand is there to be a, shall we say, synchronization with the overall oversold? Which was representative of a portion of your mass consciousness itself, re-homogenizing into that field, and then incarnating as well as many other portions as the Christ himself. There are many energies directly associated with that individual who were expressions of the same energy. Do you wish so? Would you want to go? If we are speaking again about the same, Elijah? Okay, last night I was sitting talking to friend Aksia. And after we had a meeting discussion, I had this sudden little beating, if you could hear my ears. And I said, what is this? I thought it was some information being downloaded or something, but it was different than that. So I asked, we talked about it, and we thought it was, talked about what it was. Our simple suggestion would be to remove analyzation from the process, simply emotionally experienced and understand that it was, in a sense, a form of new energy. What she talked to her, one of her guides, and he came up with that it was something from Beacon for the Pleiadian. It was just, I was tuning into the vibration of that. Did you have anything to say on that? Simply that there are connections directly to that energy. Thank you. Oh, hi. Thank you. And to me. Hi. The other night when I was in the group with you, we all close our eyes, you know, you printed yourself on us in some way. Do you? We simply, in that sense, had a transmission of thought, thereby enabling individuals who choose to receive a certain idea. What did you receive? Well, nothing that not. And I thought it was very open. So I was sort of excited about it, and nothing happened. And then on Thursday, I... By the way, we did discuss within that interaction, action the trust of timing. I know you do. I have a meditation group that I belong to, and on Thursday, I was using the meditation group when I was meditating. And I thought about that for a minute, you know, that I hadn't received anything. And then I had asked you the question about getting in touch with my spirit guide. And so I sort of did what you said, or I asked if there was anything I should know. And as soon as that came into my head, soon as I asked that, I thought I saw a face come in so that I could see it clearly. Would that you? You mean you tell me? It's that simple. Yes, I know. That's the point. This is what we have been sharing. It was a representational, shall we say, symbol of our energy. In a sense, you can say a composite individual, not simply one individual. That's the point. It looked like the class of pictures that you see. But that's what it was for you. There are other overtones, but again, it was the response you designed. Again, having them trusted the time. For there is a particular installment of these images. And many times, they, in that sense, will manifest as feelings, symbology, rather than direct pictures. It was a picture statement. Okay, and that was, it was real. I mean, I was not, I didn't just make it up. It was co-created. Whether or not you choose to make it real will be up to you. Okay. From our perspective, most real. Yeah, the other thing, when we were talking about my head in the spirit God, and you told me who they were, and you said something about that I would probably be in touch with one of some. Were you saying that there I could be a chair if I chose to? Yeah, but the idea is that you can choose the form to express the information. There are many ways to express ideas in your society. Therefore, you literally get to choose what form excites you the most. And we suggest in that sense that you use that excitement as a criteria. Therefore, right from the word go, as you say, you are having fun. And it is the spirit and willingness to express that joy and feel the excitement of that fun. That will strengthen the connection in another film. It was fun. And like for instance, I'm a storyteller now. But someone has told me that maybe what I need to do is write. That will be up to you. One can truly tell you what you need, they can simply make the suggestion, then it rings true with you or not. So it is an opportunity for you to define your position. What do you feel? Do you feel more attracted to expressing this verbally or to expressing it in writing or perhaps both? Why did you start doing that? Do not have to, but you may wish to. Alright, now I have two more questions. Oh. You talked also about vortexes and you mentioned the Delano Webrius vortex. Are there any rounds in this area? And I say this area, I'm talking about East Coast. There is one in your state of Connecticut. It is in your area you call Southbury. It is, shall we say, comparatively smaller than the other ones we have discussed. But nevertheless is a gateway. There are individuals present this evening who can direct you to that area. And the other question I have is that I am by her, I'm Irish and Scotch. And so there's always been a lot of talk about leprechauns and that also comes into the fact that I'm a story shower. Hard, is there some truth to all that? Well, understand again that the ultimate truth is composed of all truths. However, some are more or less relevant to your dimension of experience. In one sense you can say they are symbolic of the hopes and wishes within each individual, being externalized and delivered. On the other hand you can also understand that some of the origin of the mythology surrounding that particular manifestation will be some misidentifications of entities that are, shall we say, extra dimensional. They are in a sense manifestations that result from what you might call the archetypal substream of your mass consciousness itself. Is that clear at all? Well, the main thing that the archetypal substream I would put. Oh, well the idea is that there are some physical occurrences that were then misidentified in this way, and it also again symbolizes the externalization of your wishes. Thank you. Thank you. Hello. Greeting. Ha, too. You're getting there. Oh, my God. I wanted to tell you. That for those who are, shall we say, new to this interaction is a phrase from our remnant language. We no longer have language, but one said that simply means we love you. Do you see? I want to tell you some wonderful timing on that. The next morning after I was... Not you, too. Yeah, I do. Oh, well, nothing's going around. So, I would prefer to catch it. Yeah, I will. Yeah. The last time here I struggled for a time to say that, and I was picturing it wrong. And the next morning when I sat down to read, I picked up for very under the transcript that was leading from the show in California. And it ended with the word, too. So I got to see it and see how it's said, see how it's written. Oh. Which made a big difference. And then I started thinking about what it means. And last time I was so busy trying to say it, I didn't realize, I didn't think about what it means. And I realized she said that you love us. And it made me feel so wonderful that I was on a high all day. Oh, thank you. So were we. Thank you. Even so much, though, that when I discovered that where my car was parked while I was here last time, one of the house hats was stolen. Oh, how it started? It didn't bother me. I was so happy. And after turned out the next day, my husband went with me to get a new hubcack. And because of my going with him and him going with me, he got a new car, which he wouldn't have gotten otherwise. And he absolutely crazy about this new car. I mean, he's really crazy about it. Oh, why? And I got my new hubcack from my anniversary. Perhaps not what you expected, but however, something you prefer and desire. No, I prefer that. You understand, watch what you wish for, you may get it. So then the next morning, I started the next transcript, and the title was Happy Anniversary, and it was our anniversary. So I thought this was great. And then that day I went to play tennis, and I had a lot of trouble with my serve for the whole time I played tennis, like 25 years. And I tried a lot of times to make it the way I wanted it. And that day I said, well, I'm just gonna do it, right? And I did. There was no process, and I've been doing it right over time. Oh, why? Perhaps you are now being of service even in that regard. Oh, I don't, right? And those interacting with you? Well, it's harder for them, if I throw right. Maybe. Perhaps they will mirror that idea. Yeah. But I appreciate all this. I mean, it's such a nice feeling of timing and joy, and everything that's in my life is things that I want to be there. It only gets more desirable. It only gets more preferable. It only gets more exciting. Probably not. I have one question. Hey, number one. Number one, is there a form of polarity everywhere, every when? No, polarity is a particular exploration. Polarity is a particular expression of separation. So therefore, in return. Even from the perspective of your own soul, as you call it, or over soul, it is not male or female. It is neither and yet both. Therefore, polarity is an exploration of a particular style of dynamic of energy within a reality that allows one thing to stand out against the background of another. Always doesn't contain, no matter how far apart, any polarity may be. By definition, a common center. No, that answer the question. Yes, it's there. I have one other question. When I do something, does it directly affect someone else or only my version of someone else? Your version of someone else, and then someone else should they choose to participate? Perhaps in what you may call the form of a reaction to, but always, any offering you have is simply a gift. And the willingness of the individual and what they will do with that gift will determine their self-created effect. Therefore, again, you cannot be responsible for them in any way, only to them, and they are then choosing to be responsible for themselves. Does that help? Yes, it does. It does. So we're not, we don't, what we do doesn't affect everyone else, only as they choose it to. It affects them by giving them more options, alternatives, thoughts, other perspectives than the one that they commonly create, which is always the opportunity, no matter what they choose to do with it, for them to grow and expand their awareness. But it's always everyone's choice. What affects them? Perhaps sometimes unconsciously, but what we discuss with you is allowing it to become conscious and then choosing to continue to create it consciously. Thank you very much. Oh, and we thank you, I'd like to. What do you mean by responsible, too? Each individual creating their own reality is responsible for their own reality. The form of being responsible to someone else is your willingness to fully be responsible for yourself, and in doing so, then offer yourself as a gift to them. That is being responsible to rather than for them. One of the aspects of this will be in the giving of the gifts that you are, do not insist that they must take it and do a certain thing with it. Do not have a particular rigid expectation in what they then must do with what you have shared. That is being responsible, too. When you have a particular explanation that they must respond in a particular way, in that sense you are being or attempting to be, or you never can truly be responsible for their reaction, which you cannot. Is that clear? Yes. Yes, being responsible to another person is the same as just being responsible for your experience. Is being who you are, not withholding the gifts of your conscious life. As you express it, as you express it, truly express it, not have change between it, you know, not hold on to it, but release it as you express it. Then you are responsible to them. When you say to them what it is that is reflective of who you are, and for instance, not what you think they wish to hear, you are being responsible to them. When you say what you think they wish to hear, you are assuming a responsibility for them as though they cannot handle what it is you actually feel, and they can. In fact, have attracted you for the advantage that you have to offer in providing the alternative. Thank you. And to you, Sherry. Male. What's that? What's what? Back there. A lot of last time, first of all, good evening. So what do you think of once again? The interaction containing it. Last time, I had the pleasure of communicating with you. I asked a question whether my, I had been associated with my daughter in any way in our past life, and you said, yes, that we had been together in England. Could I just ask you whether I was connected with my son in any way in a past life in England? And I asked that question because my mother was born there, and I wonder if maybe we were all connected in some way. There were common connections, but may I ask you a question? Being that this is life. Right now, right here. All this information that we share simply allows you to come to particular recognition. In the searching for this knowledge, what have you come to that allows you to apply what you have found into this life? For this is truly the bottom line of these explorations. I want to guess that's very true. I should concentrate more on breaking. Notion, simply suggesting that anything that you derive from these other experiences are only as useful as they are relevant to what you are now exploring, and thereby those perspectives enable you to apply particular recognition in this life. Therefore, we now, in that sense, stray your attention to the beginning of the application of these significance to this life, for that is what will open up any other, shall we say, relevances that you may wish to connect with. But the application is what puts the mechanism into motion and allows you direct access. I just asked you one other question, right? You can ask. I have not gone probably as much reading as a lot of other people. Yes, but you are exactly where you need these. Do you understand that? And proceed. Could you give me some thoughts on how to meditate and better open up? Absolutely. Receiving more information to proceed to or for intensity. Oh, when you are speaking of the idea in the classic sense of meditation, our simple suggestion is to find a position which is comfortable, yet in which you will not fall asleep. Get in touch with the idea of what you generally take for granted your breath. Breathe intentionally, purposefully, in deeply, out deeply, establish that flow. Allow yourself to create, shall we say, a blank screen in front of you. In doing so, allow whatever thought occur to simply occur and then move on in that they will seem to be, shall we say, part of a stream of thought. Do not, in that sense, attempt to prevent them. It is quite innocent in practical anyway. Allow whatever thought to occur to run through. Then, simply, once you feel you are centered, once you feel you are somewhat blank, so to speak, then clearly establish what it is you wish to know. The clarity of your establishment, of your intention sets up the vibration for the answer to come through. Then, simply, as an answer comes, if it is phrased in the form of the question, simply listen. Listen as though you are wishing to perceive a very quiet sound, the absolutely silent. And then, when it comes, allow it to deliver its relevance and where and whenever possible, as we had just discussed, apply it in action in this life. That bridges the gap. For now, that will do. One other thing, however, is that anything that you truly do, with no hesitation, automatically, effortlessly, is in a sense a form of meditation or channeling itself. Therefore, when you are, as you sometimes say in your language, in a groove with a particular idea, that is another form of meditation. So, you need not be so rigid that that is the only way. Whenever you truly are expressing your being in this way, fully effortlessly and without hesitation, there is a similar connection that you, in a sense, illustrate in your classic meditation. Does that help? This does. If I don't quite understand what is being... You will, for it, will be geared to you. It will be quite understandable. At first, it may even seem overly obvious. Telepathic communications, which we sometimes call tell empathic, for that is more precise of the mechanism, occur along as your electricity, in a sense, the path of least resistance. And your path of least resistance, at first, in the human form may seem to come in the form of information that you already know. So, it is not that you need in that sense to rate yourself, or you already know it, but pay attention to what it is that comes up, as that is what will be most conducive for you to look at of what you already know. Apply it again into your life, but it will be quite understandable, and will only expand to your degree to understand it, otherwise it would not serve a purpose with you. Going over, in that sense, your own head would not make sense. Therefore, it will be obvious. I wanted to expand on it, can I mentally ask a question? Oh, yes. And continue to, and the answers are provided, so to speak, from the other end. And if you wish to get more specific about methods for doing such, ask them, they will share, they will provide methods which are more specific for you. And your willingness to then, getting the information, apply it. Do it, will then yield a result that perhaps you do not expect. Is that at least clear for you to proceed? That's not true. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Well, thanks for your attention to you. Hey, backstage. One. Greetings. Greetings, Mwya, and our training of existence coming into the third dimension. See if we drift from loving ourselves. Perhaps you can say, within it itself. When beginning to explore the idea of being separate from all that is, which again is an exploration and not, shall we say, a fact that is a perspective, You can truly never be separated from all that is or it would not be all that is But the idea is that when individuals began to perceive themselves as separate individuals one of the quality that that assumed was that they no longer allowed themselves to consciously continuously feel that unconditional love of creation and When in that sense individuals cut themselves off Choosing to not constantly feel that connection Shall we say many of them got down on themselves? and Then began a new societal motion Operating from the perspective of being separated and needing to rejoin that was a helpless perspective and that helplessness perceived helplessness was then judged and a cycle or a momentum of negative application proceeding and this allowed for the exploration of extreme limitation and negativity In effect it is the only way to be able to explore that negativity by set that rating from the one Now you are beginning to explore taking back these ideas Unifying what you had formally considered to be part are now understanding to be choices You know We call just a little further now We were not separated What would we be thinking? What would we be feeling if we weren't separated again being discreet individuals different things It would simply depend but one of the ideas that you do not experience when you are living your connection is isolation alone nest as you think helpless nest the need to dominate The need to force anything to occur for you being in step with the flow of creation simply need to decide what you wish to allow to manifest and Allowance again and not forcing is the mechanism of your creator The word in your language it is ecstasy No No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no You did not desert anything You chose to explore something else As again, we have discussed so therefore we will be brief When you know it all nothing is new nothing is learned nothing is discovered nothing is surprise therefore in order to explore that particular joy of discovery You chose to impose a forgetfulness of certain portions of yourself so that you can literally Rediscover them and as you dismembered yourself. You can literally remember yourself Congratulations Did not expect that It feels like I should waste the time well perhaps you may understand the following As long as you perceive it as a waste of time you will create more time as Long as you perceive it as something to escape from you will firmly anchor yourself to it when you begin to Exhibit your ability to respond to your reality in a positive way and create that heaven on earth You then automatically transform into force therefore not running from third But shall we say I'm folding into force? You never escaped from a reality that would suppose you are within a reality and allow us to remind you that The reality is within you and when you do move from third to fourth This is one of the recognition that the reality that you previously assumed you existed within exists within you So therefore if you wish look at your willingness to label anything as a waste which you can assume Assume that something can be exchanged and by definition Nothing can only if you define it can you get the effect of a scene that way, but even that belongs Do you wish to continue to pursue it? I will after oh At this time allow us to pause for a short break and Make some preparation for a guest We will resume contact in 15 to 20 of your minutes of counting
