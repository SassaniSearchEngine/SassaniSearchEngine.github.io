 Oh, I don't say continue. Sure. Great. I have two, three items for sharing. The first one for many months is you will know I've been seeking a meaningful and exciting job. I'm now scheduled for my fourth interview coming up on the 19th of this month to be a energy consultant for United of the United States. United illuminating electric energy company serving a good part of Connecticut. I guess to sum it up, I want the job, I need the job, I'm excited about the job, I know I can do the job and I'm deserving. Okay. My question I guess is how can you and anybody else listening be helpful to me in getting that job and what can I do to further increase my chances of getting this important job? Thank you very much. Very clearly we shall instruct you in a sense that the way from our perspective to in a sense get whatever it is that you want. It's simply that in any given moment from the choices available to you to only do the one that excites you the most. Period and it is that simple. Many of the lessons, many of the ideas, many of the states of consciousness that we share with your society that we illuminate in a sense upon from time to time, oil boil down in action to those simple steps. Period. It takes all that we have ever sent into consideration whereby when you are doing what excites you the most in any given moment, not just the thing that excites you the most, but at any given moment, your life will become a thread. From one exciting thing to the next and if it should be that when initiating this type of response, this type of creatorhood principle, that you will mean yourself to either that very job or one that you like, shall we say, that does. But it does not fail and if indeed that does excite you and as you have said you have clear intention, clear deserves ability, desire and definition and clear action doing what it is you can do within those parameters, you will manifest that reality or a vessel one. But no less. If you recall last fall, I actually had such a job in Manhattan for one week and then I quit. All right. Not that I didn't like the job. I really like the substance and the meaning of the job, but I couldn't refuse to take the commuter treadmill that went in the bulk of getting into the hand. And by definition, that was part of the job, therefore allow yourself to have it all. And we said that your response of leaving that scenario wasn't the innocent, a positive one for you would no longer settle for less than you are simply proceeding along those lines. That's why I came off that experience and actually created this job in the geography and the commuting aspect that I wanted. And that's the job I'm talking about. I was a recognized there is a vast difference between desiring something because it excites you and desiring something out of need. Both were present. I'm excited about this. Again, our definition of abundance is simply having what you need when you need it. And from our perspective, this has always been so anyway. Simply by again doing those things that excite you, you create more needs that are filled from the universe. I know something from the first three interviews to help me better prepare for this fourth interview to make it effective, but I will welcome and accept any help from the universe or anywhere that is available to the internet. All right. I do have that question. All right. I'm having a lot of fun with my abundance. I'm having a lot of fun with my own life. I'm having a lot of fun with my own life. I'm having a lot of fun with my own life. I'm having a lot of fun with my own life. I'm having a lot of fun with my own life. I'm having a lot of fun with my own life. I'm having a lot of fun with my own life. I'm having a lot of fun with my own life. I'm having a lot of fun with my own life. I'm having a lot of fun with my own life. I'm having a lot of fun with my own life. I'm having a lot of fun with my own life. I'm having a lot of fun with my own life. I'm having a lot of fun with my own life. I'm having a lot of fun with my own life. I'm having a lot of fun with my own life. I'm having a lot of fun with my own life. I'm having a lot of fun with my own life. I'm having a lot of fun with my own life. I'm having a lot of fun with my own life. I'm having a lot of fun with my own life. I'm having a lot of fun with my own life. I'm having a lot of fun with my own life. I'm having a lot of fun with my own life. I'm having a lot of fun with my own life. I'm having a lot of fun with my own life. I'm having a lot of fun with my own life. Generally in your society it is a company by a lot of analysis. Therefore shall we say a typical response would be, well everybody knows you can't do that for a living. And so forth. Those ideas invalidating what it is again. But you know what excites you to do without invalidating it without analysis. Answer me now. I'm having a lot. Obviously analyzing does not excite you. Maybe it will excite you to be intuitive. Give it a very chance. Alright, so can you answer the question? What excites me? What is one of the things that excites you greatly? I am so sorry. Alright, that is one idea. See how easy it was? I guess it's the judgmental. I think I'm answering my own question. You always do me enough. When something excites me, sometimes something will come in and say, oh no, no, that's alright. Alright, you don't have to do that. And by granting yourself your excitence, that's the first step. After you act upon something, you will not allow yourself to define, but it is simply that. Your allowance or your lack of allowance. Well it's kind of scary to ask how long it's time to make me... Alright, but understand, that is just the definition. That is just a viewpoint. What would one have to believe in order to be fearful of doing what excites them? Failure means... Alright, is there a primary belief within you that your actions are doomed to failure? They are not inherently by the way. Sir, it's not believed... Alright, what is that belief? Can you name it for me now? That I wouldn't be able to do something that I might... What is, as you say, the worst thing that can happen to you if you fail? I die. Alright. Even that is not an ending, you know? That's not true. Do you get archery? Yes. Alright. Now what does excite you the most? Well, maybe in the slowest speaking to you. Very good, and you are doing that. What will you do when you leave this interaction? Next thing next, next thing. Very good. That is the idea we are sneaking up. And it is that simple. For it is most effortless to do what excites you. Doesn't take any effort to do something you are excited about. That allows you to continue to do it. When you then continue to do what excites you, you are being most truly yourself. Therefore, the universe, being that you are being yourself, provides everything you need to allow you to continue to be the best you. That is how it works. If you have a belief system that is not enough to go around, that you do not inherently deserve, or you can deny it just because you exist, then you may wish to look at those belief systems. For earning something, in a sense, is the definition. That you must earn something to deserve it. All right. That's our number. Question number two. Question number two is no question. All right. Make a statement. No. People. I was involved in a car accident. How old? Two days ago. And I was in a terrible car accident, but it shook me up and finished my car off and I was hit by someone else. And I don't really have a question about it. Simply, they offer me individuals will shock themselves or jar themselves into making it change in their reality. Don't have to do it that way, but it is one way that your society chooses from time to time to do stuff. Therefore, enjoy the new you. Yeah, I feel like that. It feels like I jarred myself into... In a theater of sense, when that occurs, you rewire, in a sense, colloquially speaking, the pathways, not so much the physical lives, pathways, but the pathways of electrical activity within what you label, your brand. Very often, individuals who are involved in psychic phenomena, channeling, and those types of ideas that you label upon your plan, have indeed had such a smashing occurrence. It's very common. Therefore, does it excite you to channel? It's channel? Yeah. I love it too. Oh gosh, I don't know. I know. Then we suggest that you do not. However, again, allow yourself the opportunity to view what is available. If you cannot determine these things, which again you can, but if you would like to, in a sense, prolong it, allowing yourself whatever discovery you are exploring, simply in any given moment from what's available to you, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, do only that which excites you the most. And then you will begin what we label the ecstatic explosion of coincidence, whereby your needs will be met and you will be led to the next thing, which excites you the most. And then you will again set up a conducive atmosphere to enable yourself to realize the most exciting thing. If there is just one, generally there is not, generally there are many. You never cease to grow. One other idea is that when you do the thing that excites you the most, there's nothing to be afraid of. Your life won't then end. You always grow. You always expand. And therefore, when you do the most exciting thing, simply upon completion of that idea, the next most exciting thing will present itself. But the parameters are not in line right now, so you just can't see them. Therefore, begin in a moment to moment way. Is it possible to be too excited? Not from our perspective. No. You can have an explosion. It will feel like that sometimes. But recognize this idea. You never, never, never, under one another, as many times as you wish. Create a reality you cannot handle by definition. If you are creating it, you are able in that moment to handle it. Therefore, there are no surprises. Nothing to overwhelm you. You may create the idea of being overwhelmed. It is simply a creation and can simply be green and transformed like any other idea. All right? Thank you. Thank you very much. Do you have another question? Not at this time. All right. Feel free. And thank you again for your share. Thank you again. Share. For sure. Greetings again. Greetings to you. I have a question regarding a specific device that a friend of mine would told me about. He is a inventor of sorts. And he says at one time he constructed a special motor that in effect violated our current laws of physics. How so? In that it was more than unity. It produced more power than consumed. How all right? And then at a high speed of dominated blue light, it began to disappear. All right? My question regards that if I were to build such a device, would it be as he said? How does that relate to his reality versus my reality? I'd like to explore that question. Can you describe the mechanism of that device in more detail? We find that it's not enough available to comment upon. Yes. The motor was a ring carrying magnet which traveled through a series of coils. And that was pretty much the complete device. How very good. Yes. You can recreate this idea. Is the idea of the ring spinning? Yes. All very good. Some of the fundamental experiments we have suggested in members of your society have to do with the idea of magnetism, magnetic fields and spins. For the idea of spinning within a magnetic field, effects, reshounds, and innocence, distorts, the electro-magnetic field around your planet in ways that your scientists have not yet recognized. Certain examples this within your idea of nature, that being the rotation of your planet's body, and its effect is not very well understood by your scientists at this time. However, when you do begin in a sense again to deal with the idea of electromagnets and spins and measure the effects upon the electromagnetic field, all types of interesting effects occur. And one of the ideas may be labeled amplification. Giving you seemingly is only a seemingness more out than you put in. Does that help? Yes, it does. And I'm wondering if there would be any danger from radiation or any distortion of time and space that could be a complication. If any shall we say possible, however, if you stay within the idea of lower frequencies, lower voltages would not be so much of a factor. And I have another question. All right. Quite often you tell us that each time is the first time for you. I would imagine if I asked you the same question a hundred times in succession, it would become quite tedious to you. So apparently I don't understand what you mean by that. In a sense, from our perspective, would not be very tedious. From your perspective, upon repetitive acting, you may find it tedious. However, any time we understand in any given moment, we are anew. Every given moment, you are not the same being that asked me the question originally. And I view you in this changing manner. Therefore, I am never bored by you. For you are not, in a sense, the same individual. You recreate yourself each moment. Shall we say one of the ways you express it is with each incoming information, you give yourself the apadency of knowing more and more. In a sense, that is an illusion. You have always known it all. And pose a forgetfulness upon yourself to experience this degree of focus. Therefore, you never actually learn anything. Simply remember what you already know. What's that about? I understand. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Shannon. For sure. Yes. We talked in an earlier interaction about healing with tones. Yes. And I would like to know more about that, and how that correlate with healing with color. Thank you very much. The ideas walk, as you say, and in hand. For they are both simply different manifestations of vibration. Your body, your physicalized form. When placed in a magnetic field that allows an alignment cannot contain the idea of this ease. Now when you remove that alignment, an individual way, immediately in the next moment, recreates the idea of this ease. For all the ease begins within consciousness. Therefore can easily be recreated if the individual again has not gleaned the reason for the message. What you label this ease is in general the way that an individual will force themselves to look at something. If you look at that something prior to manifesting the this ease, there is no reason for it to be around. If you ignore, as you do chop yourself up again into compartments, what you are trying in a sense to say to yourself, then you will force upon yourself the situation where you must look at it and this is the idea of this ease. This ease allows people to do things, although they don't look at it that way. And by wallowing in it actually amplifies the effect. However, when put in an aligned magnetic field, for instance, set up as a frequency to resonate with the electromagnetic frequency of your Earth approximately seven and one half cycles for a second. Within that aligned magnetic field, this ease cannot exist. Therefore you can use any in a sense representation of vibration in order to allow yourself to align. One of the ways we have mentioned to you was the idea of bells, the tonality of bells, by allowing yourself to feel the tone, feel the note from head to toe, as you say, allowing yourself to vibrate in harmonic resonance with that tone. You create the same effect as lining yourself up within a magnetic field. Light is also a vibration, a frequency, and that also will have effects upon the physicalized body, depending the intensity of the effect can and very well does depend upon the belief systems of individuals also, but there is a physical effect. So when we speak of healing with light, healing with sound, it is simply all vibration, allowing yourself to become the tone. Lines you up, allowing yourself to become the light. Lines you up. Okay, now then does color have its own color in specific, as opposed to light, have its own vibration that correlates with the tone. In a sense, yet, but your assignment of meaning to colors is a very individualized thing. There are some rough archetypes, but individuals tend to vary in either direction from that. So what that color means to that individual will give the most pronounced effect upon that individual. For also, belief system is also vibration. You can simply visualize yourself within a bubble of light, and that will line you up. It is that simple. Just that certain individuals who have a propensity to draw their validation from the physical world will have better success with something they can feel, feel, see, smell, and so forth. So it's degrees of willingness to cure yourself to begin with. And again, it has not been the focus in your society to approach individuals with this ease and say, why have you created this for yourself? If you do begin to allow yourself to function in this way, you will find not that they necessarily think you are insensitive, but that they will then focus their attention on those ideas and find them out. Whenever any individual will allow themselves to clean the reason they have created a this ease, they will miraculously be cured, or they have allowed a symbol, again, a physiological symbol to deliver its message. And things only seem to repeat when you don't get the message. Okay, so if an individual were to surround themselves in this bubble of light, then if they decided to make that pink or blue or green, that affection would depend on their belief system? In a sense, we use blue white light for that as a representative of the frequency of the electromagnetic field around and about North Planet. So we use, no pun intended, the BLT, the blue white TETT. That is what an individual allows themselves to submerse themselves within a gelatinous blue white fluid within colloquially speaking, a bubble, and allowing themselves in a sense to merge with the content to homogenize themselves. Yeah, would they have any benefit from changing the color of that light if they should choose pink or something like that? We always preface any of our interactions when we do impart techniques to you with the following. Anything your imagination does to alter it is perfect for you. That is what your imagination is. It is your own individualized tool, although you have not chosen societally to view it that way. Individuals are now allowing themselves to recognize. Your imagination is a tool. Your imagination is real, just as real as this is, just what you are willing to validate. These interactions go on within my imagination, but I validate what I am getting, therefore I do believe I am here with you. Thank you for that perfect. Any way that your imagination will alter anything that comes into your contact will be perfect to tailor it to you. All right? Thank you very much. Shannon? Sure. Yes. I just had a relationship where the individual got sick and she's got cats. I know you're saying that one of the kind of animals that you have that are part of your family can associate part of the disease or a disease for you so that you don't have to go through it and you can still experience it. It is from time to time they will serve that function as a symbol. Can they also do that with personalities? In a sense, but not too much along those lines of thinking. There may be similarities in, shall we say, this position, but that is the law of attraction. Do I notice the most true personalities that this individual would have and both cats have the same personality, but individually? Well, recognize also the idea that you label cats are mirrors and they do reflect back to you many ideas as our each individual are mirrors. You are all reflecting to each other constantly. If you approach somebody and what you label upset, you will generally find them to respond after a certain point with upset. If you approach them in peace, in love, even what you label the most, tenacious and obnoxious individuals who respond in peace and love, very interesting, may just be what you are looking for to establish peace upon your planet. Begin with again yourself. All right. Is that a decision? Yes, sir. Thank you very much. Sharing. For sure. Thank you. Two questions. One thing, I'd like to feed back on, do you call it a excitement? What you can say to you? With integrity. Yes. I call it, you're loveless. All of you are loveless. Is that a good? I have people pretend to take off certain filters with that as an example. Pretend that you just had all the money that you needed in life. What would you love to do? That then they would make a list of what they would love to do. And then, you know, have other filters that say, if I could move anywhere in the United States, what would I love to do? You know, and go through some of the things. Very good. And this may indeed aid in the Sixty Other female individuals who are labeling that she was having difficulty finding her excitement. Simply, along those lines, allow yourself to take out the stoppers and establish what you would do if you really could. Very good. Second question is, do you have any outline or format for, you know, spiritual evolution as an example, you know, that's in meditating ten minutes a day or writing a loveless. Very good. And thank you very much for the opportunity. It is very, very simple, as is most anything. If it works for you, do it. If it doesn't, don't. That is all. If a belief system which did work for you no longer does, stop doing it. It is that thing. Allow things to be what they are. Again, there are more than one individual. Therefore, by convention, there is more than one way. Each way is valid. And again, you can at any time utilize the tool of your imagination. What do you imagine you would do? If there is a particular way you desire to be, what do you imagine a person acts like who is already that way? If you will butt conjure up that image with this tool and then act that way, you will cut through what you label the steps, the processes and being that individual in that given moment, which you can then choose to recreate. And it is that simple. Is this a the system? Yes. Do you have another question? Do you also recommend stealing your mind and mitigating a regular basis or...? If it works for you, yes. That in a sense was one of the ideas we conveyed at the beginning of this interaction. When we spoke of relax, release, reflect, remember, respond, realize, rejoice. In order to, again, center yourself. It's a very good and useful tool to be able, in a sense, to allow yourself to calm down. Whatever that state represents to you, whether it's a filling of the mind, whether it's a recreating your place of perfect peace, that is the tool that is available to you. Can you expand without it? Absolutely. Therefore, it is one of, in a sense, the tools available in your toolbox. And you may use anyone you wish in any order you wish if your clear intention is to evolve, is to expand in positivity, in peace, in love and life. You can only attract that reality if you are not willing to act that way. Therefore, again, the only steps that we suggest is that an individual begins to ponder the basics, that you do create your own reality, that you do so through your belief systems. That by changing, figuring out what your beliefs are and changing the ones that do not serve you, your life will immediately transform to that which you prefer. Cutting through, again, all that, boils down to simply doing what excites you the most within integrity. Without forcing yourself upon others, hurting others, hurting yourself. For there is no need to force something you own, you offer it as a gift. If somebody accepts your gift, very well. If they do not, very well. That is the pleasure of giving your gift, that there is no conditions upon the giving. I will give you my gift. If you take it, I will love you. If you do not, I will not. You do not have to act that way. If we look at it as a gift that one may or may not accept, is there any other questions? Thank you very much. Very much for sharing. Sharing. For sure. Yes. I have a question by Poxy. Oh, I Jim would like to know that when you tell, can you see the people you see? Thank you very much. In the way that you mean, now, I perceive you as relationships of energy. In a sense, collectively, I perceive you as a crystalline manifestation of energy and each individual as a factor of that crystalline. As again, relationships of energy to each other. So not in a physicalized sense. When these interactions take place, an individual's heart speaking, as a physiological channel of ears are hearing, I am not hearing what it says. It is translated through the mentality of the physiological channel and sent back in a sense, globally speaking, as a chunk of information that I can then interpret from my end. If the eyes of the physiological channel were allowed to open, I would not see from them. He would. This is in part one of the reasons he has not allowed the opening of the eyes, for he feels it would diminish the contact, diminish the communication. This is not so. It would simply allow him to participate on a more grassroots level and when the trust has developed to do so, this will be available. Does that help? Yeah, it does. It does. It has some questions that Andrew would have too. Oh, right. I have a question on my own. All right. Do you have lineage like a family tree? In a sense, yes. So you have physiological parents and they have parents and such. And given you exist in our future, are people that you've interacted with and you know, we've been participating with, are any of them like your ancestors? Or would that even be something that we've. And then there are many different relationships that individuals upon our planet have with individuals upon your planet. So it depends again on the specific person, the specific relationship. Can you specify more clearly? Well, with Andrew, Andrew at all in your lineage, in that sense, but you know what it really is? No. As a contemporary, yes. As a contemporary on your planet right now. As a contemporary upon my planet now, and in a sense, what you have been getting within these interactions is a blended energy. I, myself, as you know me in a sense, since Bashar is not really my name, you only in a sense know me. As an individual, are the main conduit or medium, if you will, for these interactions. This is in a sense something I am quite good at. And in a sense, have developed a level of expertise. The individual that would correspond to the future self of the channel is a contemporary friend of mine, a far more planet, if you will, and has been participating from, as you say, the word go, in these interactions. But as a blended energy, allowing near the sense to be in the forefront, as the physiological channel allows himself to trust more and more, this energy will be more and more of a blended energy. There are also other energies involved that will be labeled as energies of the association of worlds. So they have been participating? Yes. They are simply at that. But I understand that there are slight differences in the presentation you see as Andrew's presentation of myself, and Donald's presentation of myself because of the existence of this blended energy. And in a sense those differences will continue because there is still really speaking an extra being in there. Yes. Great. Thank you very much. You have another question? Well, actually given what I got on this line, I had a sense that I also have a contemporary life in the Indian planet. Oh, you can tell me about that or you can tell me that? Oh, no, no, no, no. When you already tell me, I will be glad to acknowledge it. Okay. Thank you, that was going to be really good. Tell me the degree of the film. However, you are also exploring and there is a joy in this discovery that we would not rob you of. Thank you very much. Sharing. Yes. Sometimes I have been trying to do actual travel. All right. How does it feel trying to do it rather than doing it? Oh, you don't need to judge the process as it happens. And these are the physiological byproducts of judging it. It wouldn't come. All right. Oh, is that? It definitely was. You had judged it as uncomfortable before it was and it's different from what you consider to be your normal day to day frame of mind. But it does not have to be uncomfortable, uncomfortable. It is up to you. Is that normal? In a sense, it is natural. But again, it is your judgment of the sensations and not the actual sensations that are in a sense causing you the difficulty. Remember, you cannot create any reality you can't handle. And you may wish to bear this in mind when you are judging those sensations. Would not be experiencing them unless you could handle them. And it's just a lack of reason. Always relax. In a sense, you will not get out. Again, this is the school of will of your body by any kind of forcing. It is 100% at allowance. If you feel yourself beginning to push yourself out, relax. That will allow what seems to be the relief. Relax. People, tense up. Relax. Relax. Let's tense up. Hold you firmly in there. Listen. Hold on. Thank you very much. For now. For sure. Yes. One of my jobs is doing the tax. Oh, right? I am still looking for the moment that excites me the most to send the taxes. Oh, right. And I cannot find it. How can I deal with doing things that don't excite me the most? And finding them to excite me. All that other many ways to be creative in this regard that we make a suggestion, you will just listen to this nation on a block. Well, I want to make a happen. We'll put it all together for me. I have to get the figures together. It's just sitting down and doing that. And it's what I started. It's okay. It's just finding the moment. I can always find something else to excite me more than sitting down and putting figures here. If you grant yourself your excitement in any given moment, you'll find it all fall into place and there will be a day where you are excited to do it. But when you keep making it an issue, it remains an issue. When you elect me and do what excites you, now in a sense you get out of the way what excites you now making room for anything else that may need to be done. But in the process of following your excitement. Oh, oh, if you say oh. An issue, it remains an issue. When you elect me and do what excites you, now in a sense you get out of the way what excites you now making room for anything else that may need to be done. But in the process of following your excitement. Oh, oh, if you say oh. Then I'm trapping into the actual details by having a clear intention doing what excites you, the details take care of themselves. And nothing is what, out nothing is extraneous. I know it doesn't seem likely that it will excite you to do your taxes. But if you again right now begin in any given moment to do what excites you, you will miraculously see the space of time where that does occur. Enabling you to not only do them, but do the most effectively. All right? That is trust. And a reality that you do prefer. Just because it's never been that way doesn't mean anything. You are creating from an old standpoint. When you change your new standpoint, everything changes. You get different results from seemingly the same actions. All right? Thank you very much. Sharon? Yes. You spoke of the spark of light that would ignite in the middle of the east. Could you explain that a little bit? And what exactly is that? Is that like a mystical thing that's going to go through the sun? As it's done, what we are allowed to share is in some way to some degree we are speaking physically. In a normal way to some degree we are speaking spiritually. For very specific reasons, we will not define this any further. Allow yourself again to expect a positive result. That is belief in what you prefer. All right? One other idea. There is distinction which we draw from time to time. Between the idea of expectations and expectancy. We recommend one has expectancy that things will work out in a way that you do prefer that is most conducive. However, many choose to have expectations. What expectations are are rigidizations. I will only accept this reality if it occurs in this certain way. That does not take into consideration all the way possible and locks you into it only occurring in that way which may take much time. Therefore in your visualizations and your projections for your future, have the idea that you will expect and see without rigidizing the way you will accept it. For instance, your abundance. If you rigidly put the parameter that you will only accept your abundance in money, it takes far longer to collect your abundance. If you are opening to allowing your abundance to come in any way, shape or form, that it will not only does it but generally because of your relaxing and allowing a lot of money also follows. Therefore again, it is all about the points of view. Does that help? Yes. Thank you very much. Cheering. Yes. Bob and Carol of our Thursday Night Group have been very positive telling about a book they both read. I think the title is The Nine Faces of Christ. You will wear that book and can you say anything and critique of it? Not at this time. I say. Okay. Simply that the physiological channel has not read the book and we are not allowed access to the ideas of which you speak. If it speaks to us, you will say. Thank you very much. Cheering. The show is welcome. Yes. Disease and that people create their disease. What does that baby to come in that are already disease? Does that mean count? That generally will fall under the category of you label, karmic reaction. Now understand we have labeled that karma is self-imposed in that balance will be maintained, balance will be restored, but it is a self-imposition that must do so on a tit for tat level. When you do realize that you do impose your own karma, you are in that moment if you choose to continue to recreate it free of that style of karma. However, many individuals shall we say most individuals at least at this point in timing upon your planet have not freed themselves from their self-imposed cycle. Therefore, many will carry over ideas from path incarnations for various reasons and this is our perception in this instance. Does that help? Like you, Cheering. Sorry. One moment. That will be but a few moments left in this interaction. Percy, when you speak about abundance, like for instance, abundance will come and then money and money. We say abundance is always existing. Abundance will come, puts it out into the future. It is here now. Percy, could you give me some examples of abundance? Having what you need when you need it. That's it. But now do you really allow your needs to remain on consistent level or will you increase them according to your excitement? I see. So it doesn't necessarily mean a lot. Well, it can if you follow your excitement, you will create a lot of need. So it's depending on your need. If your need would regulate the abundance that would be available to you. In a sense. That is one way to present it. Okay. Thank you very much. Sharon. Yes, Bishar. Eight. I'm also going to ask a question by proxy from my daughter who was not with us here tonight. Oh, right. She is a young adolescent girl who wants to know why so many young girls are quite attached to the animal that we call the horse. And how that serves them. There are many subesions. There are many young men upon young planets that are also attached to such as them. So it is not from our perspective a gender oriented attachment. But for a variety of reasons, animals also reincarnate and may accompany individuals from lifetime to lifetime. And that is our sensing within that situation of your individual life daughter and a horse. Thank you. Thank you very much. Sharon. Bishar. It seems difficult for me to accept that out of all of the people in this or on this earth that you meet up with so many people you feel that you've known before. And that you've shared times within past lives. All right. If you say so, why is it that difficult? Because there are so many people. Well, there are very many expressions within the oneness of God or all that is. But you do have a tendency for as we have said, you can only experience the reality you are the vibration of to travel in a sense in soul families. And they can be very vast. And there can be particular individuals that you have in a sense with more experiences with others as you have lived. Let's experience this with and you may go on certain recognitions based on those most recent relevant ones. Does that help? Yes. Can we answer another question or almost rise to the climate? Well, I mean, when you go into a pet store and you pick out an animal and you bring it home and you feel like you've known this animal, it just seems that it was even more difficult. That it was in your town and it was right there. And, you know, it seems like you should have to search sometimes. Understand this one I do. Individuals in your society from time to time will ask us, well, I think I'm in my fifth of my sixth lifetime. No. You have lived hundreds of thousands of lifetimes in not only this universal reality, but other universal realities all together. You have had time to meet many individuals. And there's nothing so unusual about this idea. But would you say like an old soul present and a new, like, you know, I had some people in my life that I know, you know, many, many times over and new people that are new souls fresh souls. From our perspective, this is a misnomer. Simply the idea of individuals remembering more, remembering less. But there is a similarity in the sense to soul ages. And that is somewhat of a, that means it's a repository, but in the lead it's attitude. All right? At this time, we wish again to express our appreciation for your love and willingness to co-create peace within the world. And we wish again for an understanding that as you do, you will realize and manifest peace without. We bid you a most fun and loving. Good night.
