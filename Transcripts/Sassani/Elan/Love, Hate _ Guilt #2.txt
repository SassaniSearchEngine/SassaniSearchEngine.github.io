 All right, I'll pay 10 to 15 minutes. All right. Allow us to continue. And as we were just about to say, if there is a clarification specifically requested, do proceed. Hi. I kind of am, I was struggling with the situation of having to get involved with business association with people that I'm not sure about. And every time I think about going into the business, I get this horrible feeling of fear of ripping through my body. Oh, I knew you sensed that this feeling of fear is a perceptive intuitiveness? Or in that sense, the idea that something that you do not prefer is most likely? That's what I'm trying to decide. Is it like you're committing to any work or is it the reality that this is a dangerous situation in my body saying don't. I don't think I should have such a horrible feeling every time I think I'm going to get tied up with them. Well, first of all, understand that whatever you feel is what you feel. Allow yourself at first to feel that rather than labeling that it should be this way or should be that way. But closing your eyes, sitting up straight, breathing deeply. What is again the first thing that comes to your mind in terms of is this fear specific to your intuitive knowledge of the situation? Or is it an overall fear? What is your first perception most strongly? Without hesitation? Answer. That was, if it was other people, I wouldn't have the fear. Now, this tells you in no uncertain terms that that is the case. Yeah. Now, are you going to now allow your actions to be reflective of what you know to be true for yourself? Well, it's going to be tricky to get out of the situation because it feels very... Yeah, I'm gonna. It feels as though I'm being led into a lion's den. And I, to extricate myself is going to be a chance. Do understand that being led implied following. Right. And following implies you are on your own volition, your own control, and choosing to follow. Right. Meaning you can turn around. That's it. So far I've been following and I want to turn around. Oh. So, but they are also very needy and I want to help them. So, it's out of the obligation and compassion that I feel like I'm walking into this den. Do you feel that doing something for them instead of allowing them to do it for themselves is truly fulfilling a need or creating a new sense of need? Yeah. So, it's creating a so dependency of a man. Oh. So, therefore, what you are saying is not truly what you are providing anyone. Yeah. So, now what will you do? For this is the bottom line. Now you must make that decision and do it gently. Well, you just have made the decision. Now, be willing to embody it. And if, and that said, you feel that your approach in doing so is gently all well and good. That is your compassion. Without feeling sorry for them, you can feel in that sense what they are feeling. A form of empathy. But once that empathy devolves into sympathy, you are feeding their own feelings of disempowerment. You are, in a sense, agreeing with them that they do not have their own power. So, sympathy in that sense, at least in that sense, is not constructive acknowledgement of not only your own power, but their power as well. And what you are saying that you are providing in the form of assistance, if it is merely allowing them to continue to create a need, is not truly filling any need. Now what will you do? I wonder how much to do for them before I walk away from the situation. And there's something else which is, does it mean that once I love myself enough I can walk away from this and create these situations? Is this something to do with? Absolutely, but you already love yourself enough. Now simply be willing to remind yourself in moments where you doubt that, that that is so. And remember when you doubt that, that is not a lack of faith that is having faith in something else perhaps that you don't love yourself. And you get to choose once you realize where you place the trust, where you place the faith, once you realize that you get to choose where you are. And you get to choose where you wish to. So understand that you already fundamentally love yourself. What it is a matter of is again removing any conditions through which you will express that love. It is up to you to completely, unconditionally express that love to yourself. And you need not express that unconditional self-love at the expense of someone else. Unconditional self-love automatically increases your ability to unconditionally love someone else. But very often unconditional love for someone else is the full allowance to allow them to be who they are choosing to be. So it may come off from their perspective as a form of indifference. But it is truly a very attached form of detachment. For you are in empowering them establishing the attachment, but you are detaching yourself for being responsible for them, which is again in effect a disempowering notion. And then I am thinking of lending them or giving them a car so that they can do their work separate from me. And that seems like not necessary. In a sense from my particular perception of what you are saying, it is a form of guilt as we have discussed. And therefore a disempowerment to yourself and them as well. Now if you are doing it because you love and it brings you excitement and joy to do so, then you are doing it out of self-love and love of them. If you are doing it out of, shall we say, shame and guilt, then everyone is in that sense being disempowerment. So then they are on their own and they might seem stranded but they will deal with it, right? Well they dealt with it this far utilizing your assistance. Therefore either they will attract a similar symbol or have the opportunity to begin to do it themselves. But you can do so in your full integrity with again an unconditionally loving over tone. For if you are doing it for an empowering reason, you are doing them the greatest service possible within the circumstance. And you allow them to perpetuate their disempowerment. Again, that is what will be, shall we say, felt and expressed through them. The disempowering notion. Good. Okay. I think that's enough because you only have ten minutes and I thank you. Oh, there is no time limit whatsoever. Was there something in terms of a clarification requested from what we had discussed at the beginning of this interaction, in terms of love, hate and guilt? Well, yeah. Well, no. My issue is self-love and guilt I feel I have to give, give, give, but I don't know how to receive. So receiving self-love is probably a hard part. I know that it does not generally translate well into your language, but perhaps in expressing to them, I love you so much I could not possibly give you this car. You will be getting the idea and expressing it. And allowing them to see that form, a form of unconditional love is the willingness to grant them their power. And not allow them to use you as an excuse. If you're not there, I have no power. That is their tool. And that is not completely accurate. If you buy into it, you can get the effect of it. But what you are now discussing is not buying into it. It's not feeding their own disempowerment. And also, again, understanding and allow me to be emphatic about this. You do love yourself. Perhaps you do not always express it. But you always fundamentally embody it. So begin to, rather than feeling you need to achieve self-love, keep reminding yourself, oh yeah, I love myself. Almost forgot. Oh yes, I love myself. I already do. All that is does, I will not argue with all that is. It is practical. Oh thank you. Shut it. Good luck. Oh, it is male. A couple of things. Firstly, I would like some definitions if you can. Oh, why? I find definitions very, very useful. It helps clarify what you are doing. So if I just give you a quick list, could you give you some quick definitions? Oh, why? OK, anger. How do you define anger? Anger is simply alignment. It tells you when you are looking at a particular issue, place, person, or thing, this is who I am, this is not. Now this generally devolves, so to speak, into what you call judgment and invalidation of the thing that you are not. But true anger, that alignment, which allows you to re-align yourself with your purpose only last 10 to 15 of your second. And sometimes you have the expression count to 10. OK, yeah. Will that do or what there's something more specific? Well, I understand what anger is, but I've been betting to define it as a precise definition. Alignment. Just alignment? It is one form of alignment. All right. Also what you call laughter, what you sometimes call crying, is also an expression of alignment. In general, anger is, this is me, but the thing you are quote unquote angry about is not me, whereas laughter is, this is me. OK. See ya. One moment. To expand, anger is alignment through the exploration of differences, where laughter would be alignment through the exploration of similarity. Thank you. That's good. OK. Definition of fear. Fear is believing that a reality that you do not prefer is most likely. Yeah. Good. Tara? Terror is really believing. And also in that sense, with the over or undertones of completely not creating your own reality, and something can slip in and happen to you, thereby a denial that everything happens from you. It can also, perhaps you can say be what you call an instinctual defense mechanism, but once it becomes conscious, no longer needs to be interpreted in that way. OK. Thank you. Guilt? Guilt is the complete removal of self-love, the imposition of conditions, and the assignment of no value to who you are. The complete opposite of unconditional love itself. Beautiful. Thank you. Grief. Grief is, in that sense, the expression of the belief that something can be lost, which it cannot. Yes. OK. Despair. Despair. Despair, in a sense, is generally an expression of grief, whereby once again, the perceived helplessness of the self-love, the perceived helplessness through the belief that you do not create your own reality, results in believing that something can be lost, that there are things external from you which are not part of you and can then henceforth be lost. All right. No, with despair, incidentally, it's often a point to which, from which people transform. It's like the bottom of the rhyme. Well, that is one way to transform you. Yes. But it is not the only way. OK. You have an expression that once you are at the bottom, the only place you can go is up. But you can simply, in that sense, embody up from wherever you are. You need not fall to the bottom to then go on. Anxiety. Anxiety is the energy of excitement interpreted through negative terms. Rather than utilizing it as an alignment, you utilize it as, perhaps you can say, a form of doubt or lack of trust in the thing that you prefer. OK. Now, let's look at the positive side. Oh, this is fun. Yeah. Joy. What is joy? Joy is the willingness to express the things which are reflected of who you choose to be. OK. How does that differ from ecstasy, then? They are, in a sense, akin, in general, what you call ecstasy will be an intensified form of joy. When you, in that sense, embody who you chose to be through the fulfillment of your excitement in every given moment, the momentum of, perhaps you can say, successive joys is an ecstatic explosion. OK. So, joy would be a number of excitement. So, a continuation, as it were, experience of a continuation of excitement. Would you say? Perhaps you can say ecstasy is the embodiment of truly being willing to be who you chose to be in positive terms, according to preference. This is the emotion that corresponds to the belief that that is so. OK. Thanks. That's the definitions. I'll just, now, another topic, if you want, eh? Now, by the way, were you to act at a different time, you could get completely different answers. This is simply, in that sense, the momentary sensing of a particular presentation of these ideas. Very good. I appreciate that. Oh, thanks. Now, I'd like to just address the topic that I'm involved with, and that is the notion of world harmony. And you've heard this spoken to by other people, Ted Hall in particular. Hey, the indoor. The indoor role. Yes. He sends his love, by the way, to everyone here and yourself. We think, he did have a question, if I may, very quickly. Oh, very quickly. Time's up. Time's up. I'll go on. He's had some information presented to him, which is apparently from scientific realms on the planet, that the ozone layer, in fact, is, uh, been depleted far more extensively than the first thought. That is not our perception. It's not. Also, understand that, as well as the negative connotations assigned to the symbol, that it is also, in a sense, a reflection of the opening of, perhaps you can say, the crown chakra of the planet itself. So, it's truly, in that sense, depends on the way you choose to express that idea. You can express it as the lessening of protection, or you can express it as your particular ability to now absorb that much more energy. Yeah. Yeah, that's great. Oh, please. Yeah, thank you. I'm sorry to be glad to hear that. Just back to World Harmony. I've been working on this for some time. I'm not working, playing really, traveling, meeting people. And it's really starting to come together in a very wonderful way. And I've achieved this by following my excitement, uh, with integrity, as you know. Uh, what I've suddenly realized is what I'm creating here, or something to create, is the foundation of a new society. And, uh, the opportunity for people to join in this means that everyone can be part of this. People often ask me, how many members have you got? And I say 5.5 billion people. Because all of them have not chosen to yet activate their membership. Exactly. Exactly. So, it's, uh, it's like a crystal seed. And, uh, I feel all we need to do is just create this small group, perhaps, of people who are willing to express and operate and live that way. And it'll grow. Well, in a sense, you create a bubble. And as you are willing to embody that bubble, you attract many other bubbles which then coalesce into a larger bubble. Finally, in that sense, encompassing your entire planet and its inhabitants. Yeah. I couldn't have done it there myself. Thank you. Okay. That's about it, I'll thank you for the moment. Well, if there is more, we will share again. Back there. Just one thing, a comment about self-love. Well, I did this one. I looked in a mirror and I had no judgment on myself. Well, how exciting. How did that feel? That is looking your true self in the eye and acknowledging it as a reflection. That is what you are as an expression within all that is. All that is admires the reflection of you. Now it is, perhaps, up to you to mimic that vibration and admire that same reflection in yourself. Now, I took that as being unconditional love. And that is how simple it is. Your mirror, in a sense, is a metaphor for everything external is a reflection of your internal consciousness. And in fact, perhaps more appropriately speaking, what you consider to be your internal consciousness, your body consciousness, is actually within your overall consciousness and not the other way around. Proceed. Just a comment. That is it. Oh, you are. Hey. Greetings. I have two subjects. The first one, Thursday in Egypt, I finally met a person that I was greatly attracted to, Janice Nicholas from Perth, Australia, whom of course that afternoon he had a one-on-one session with. My question is, can you tell me whether we might be soulmates or knew each other in past lives, some such connections? There is a strong momentum behind that idea. But what is it you are really asking? Well, I intend to correspond with her, but how in the world does somebody strengthen a relationship with somebody who's all the way around the other side of the world? Oh, thank you. By expressing, perhaps, expect and see that something will come of it, but not having rigid expectations that it must come in one form or another. What I am saying is allowing it to be what it is rather than insisting that it must be something else. Once you are willing to do that, then it will present itself as to what it is more clear. Well, it's good that we both believe in miracles. That helps. Now, in that sense, what do you mean? I don't let you get away with that. Things can occur that in normal third density thinking, it would be ridiculous to think that anything might happen between two people who met for two days and then live on opposite sides of the world. Forget it. I then assume that perhaps you have not understood what I have said. For that is implying a specific expectation. I really don't have a specific expectation. Well, understanding that miracles are the rule rather than the exception. What would then seem so miraculous about this? I would just like to see a relationship grow. In a particular expected format or however it will develop. Any way at all will be very acceptable. Then I promise you in that sense, guarantee you if you approach it from that perspective, it will occur and be what it is and deliver to you what it needs to, to allow you to that much more fully express than you choose to be and nothing less. Did you indicate earlier that maybe we did have some connection in past lives? Yes, but your particular ilk toward feeling that is what tells that to me rather than a specific site that I need help. And therefore if you wish to explore that, go right ahead. But what will enable you to tap most strongly into it is the commonality of exploration in this life with her specifically. That will allow bleed through from similar explorations in other lives. I remind you you have lived thousands and thousands of lives, all of you. So the reason it may sometimes only seem like a few is some of them are simply completely irrelevant to what you are exploring. And the ones that come at the past lives are simply the ones that have some degree of commonality. So if you explore what the relationship means to you and that will provide the commonality for what lives will then stand out and really, if that's even necessary for some time, that may provide a distraction for what's going on in this life. In the here and now, maybe it's the law of attraction that really is going on here and the likes attract likes and that's why I was strongly attracted to it. Sometimes, but again your willingness to accept whatever form it comes in will allow you to be more receptive for things you may have missed if you very narrowly focused on only expecting a particular thing. You may when you narrowly focused on only expecting a particular thing miss the point altogether. I shall remain general. I'm referring to again is that one would need to be V one rather than A one. I assume that we all have more than one soul made. But if there is to be one V one in this life, what will enable you to realize that most fully is relaxing that definition paradoxically most times rather than insisting on that definition. That allows the space for the comfort of all to come forth and then be compared and exclude allows you to get to know each other without the defenses. Very good. Next subject. Second subject. Following. When a person opens up to who they really are remembers more of who they really are. Could you talk about what kind of stages or phases they go through as they progress further and further into fourth density and maybe some of the issues that arise because they start to see themselves and be able to see themselves. And behave rather drastically different maybe than normal third density behavior. Oh, in general what will occur as you are willing to dive into self exploration is that things that again we have labeled were stored through denial in the subconscious closet will begin to for forth. They do so in the form of emotions in general that they are non preferred beliefs they come in the form of negative emotions. If one denies those emotions back in the closet knocking louder upon the door. If one acknowledges those emotions and then doesn't stop at that point. But upon the acknowledgement and feeling of those emotions traces them back to the belief will I feel this negative way. What must I believe to feel this they then get the opportunity through acknowledgement of those beliefs to choose the new beliefs and the new actions that accompany them and empty the closet. Through the denial however the closet gets shall we say repacked. And again the ideas being that they are shall we say desiring to be expressed knock louder does this fit what you are asking. No let me be more specific well understand that I do understand where you are coming from what I have said addresses one aspect of it but please do be more specific. My brother thinks he's Jesus Christ. Well the second coming. Well one moment we have discussed this before the second coming is not to occur through a single individual. It is the expression and embodiment of the Christ spirit the unconditionally loving of self and other spirit through each individual. Jesus shall we say the embodiment is not necessarily completely synonymous with the Christ spirit. For you separate Jesus the embodiment as being separate from you and the Christ spirit is within each individual. Now Jesus and the Christ spirit are truly one and the same I am saying there is a perception of separation. But just as Jesus and the embodiment and the Christ spirit are one and the same the point of the embodiment was to show you you all contain the Christ spirit. Therefore you are all Christ some of you in waiting but nevertheless all Christ and the second coming is the acknowledgement of this expression and spirit within you. Reminding perhaps him that that will occur to everyone then allow them to see that this is simply his version of it not that he needs strongly identify with the embodiment of Jesus does this make sense. There is also a great deal of denial going on which is why I laid down that foundation. There are negative emotions coming up I need not tell you. They are not being looked at from the perspective of the Christ's creatorhood of what I believe to be created therefore there are more beliefs being stuck back into his closet so to speak and there is a pressure being created by the louder knocking. That is one aspect the other aspect is again perhaps again the non-acknowled of the Christ within everyone not to take away from his special expression but to grant the equality and validity within all. To welcome the awakening of that spirit within him but not in exclusion every way and not needing to adopt someone else his name. That does fit because at this point my perception he feels quite superior. We are also addressing that but are also addressing that the unconditionally loving Christ spirit within you all does not promote fear which is powerless. The feeling of power. So you may share that as well. I am not responsible for him but I am working and playing and doing very responsible to him and I am out of ideas I guess because it is like water off a duck's back. Well the idea is all you can do is offer the gift and as we have used as the analogy with the receipt in case he wishes to return it. The true giving of the gift is the giving of it. Here this is yours do what you want with it. If you use it throw it up to you I give this to you freely because I love it. The insistence is matching that resistance within us. Most recently I have been pushing the idea that like the rest of us he deserves to experience the consequences plus or minus of his behavior. He cannot in that sense avoid what you put out is what you get back and that is automatic. Well part of that is how do I receive some of his edicts or commands or demands or whatever. He's not looking for disciples he's looking for hand servants and slaves. Well you are not in that sense willing to fulfill that role for it would be not only the disempowerment of yourself but the acknowledgement of the disempower in him for it implies that he need control something externally which then expresses the lack or feeling of lack of control internally. So light not allow him to give his gifts as well and in clear unconditionally loving terms say thank you or no thank you but still saying thank you very much. Oh thank you. I had a question look for that I want to make a comment on this question. Oh please do and speak up we would not want to miss it. It seems like his brother is being in a certain way but our civil is the one with learning more from us. Oh thank you. Not perhaps more but as much from what his brother is expressing and this is of service. I feel yourself and what are other beings from Israel something that are in touch with us. Hey many. Now not always do individuals shall we say decide to using your slang pick up the ball and run with it. There are many agreements in place perhaps you can say relatively few individuals actually choose to embody it due to the fact that this is somewhat unconventional in your society but it is still offered and as perhaps some of them become in touch with some of the individuals such as the people before you who are willing to express this this idea begins to wake more up within them as a discrete possibility but there are shall we say many individuals expressing it in some terms on some level it is increasing. But again we have unconditional agreements therefore there are no insistences that they must be played out though it brings us great joy when they are we also understand the timing the right and the reason when it does not but there are more individuals than perhaps you are aware of beginning to awaken and express this idea interestingly enough they do not always describe it as an extraterrestrial source they may interpret it in many ways some of which will be angelically interpreted some of which will be interpreted as simply spirit guide. There is not always even the necessity for there to be the distinct and discrete label of who we are as coming from where we are as much as the information which is what is important to us. And can you tell us what is the female counterpart I mean this is the first time I find that that word. You will understand that as a physical expression you have an over soul and so does at this level of understanding each and every one of you what you call your soul your over soul your higher self does not matter but there seems at this level to be a separation. You have one over soul you have another over soul and so forth. When one over soul expresses more than one individual in the same contemporary timeframe this is called counterpart consciousness. You may understand that your over soul expresses what you call reincarnationally and these are your other lives lived in other time frames but you also from time to time for some reason. You have a similar relationship to what you would call your past and future lives but this is known as counterpoint consciousness. In our ancient understandings we drew these similar types of separations and according to that particular frame of thinking you may still shall we say interpret that on some level of understanding I have a similar understanding of what you would call your past and future lives. You may still shall we say interpret that on some level of understanding I have a discrete over soul which is shared by several other of my contemporaries but as one expands and begins to shall we say incorporate all these into a singular idea. It is now more the notion from our perspective that we all ultimately our over soul so to speak this is quite arbitrary ultimately traced back to having a single over soul. So on the one hand all individuals in our society are counterparts on that level but there are still breakdown and distinctions perhaps you can say remnant thinking so to speak. So therefore my female counterpart would be the one that I represent from your particular definition of understanding and sharing the same over soul. Does that make any sense at all? Little bit. It gets a bit complicated where we are discussing multi-dimensional concepts through a uni-dimensional so to speak perspective. The female counterpart we are coming to with some other channel that is altogether possible and likely though it is also at the disposal of this channel from time to time to express it when there is a particular reason to have an overtone of what you call a female style of energy or we still do in body as male and female and in that sense different nuances will occur through that idea also for your own identification since you still very strongly identify the title of speaking with male and female. Can you tell the name of your female counterpart? Once again we have no names per se but the designation that we have assigned to counterpart consciousness of myself, Elan and again this is quite arbitrary is Anya. And speaking about names, does big nose mean anything to you? Repeat. Big nose? Big nose? Oh my. Not by that particular vibration. What does it mean to you? In other words we do not recognize it by the name so what is the energy behind it? What does that particular nomenclature, big nose mean to you? It is the name given to me, a used by a particular being for me. Oh, it would simply in a very specific sense point to the idea that your expansion will also be embodied by the expansion of your physical senses themselves. I think then the same question for you. As you expand your consciousness your physical senses will also expand, your ability to see perhaps beyond what you will have considered in that sense to be your normal everyday reality. And in this case again there is an emphasis upon your particular sense of smell. What does it mean to you? I have been smelling things or whatever smells which are not supposed to be. Ah, exactly what we mean. In terms of an expanded sense of hearing you would perhaps seem to hear things that would seem to quote unquote not be there. You are simply expanding your sensitivity. In terms of sight you may see things particularly at first out of the corners of your eyes you are now beginning to expand your vision. You have a very strong relationship with what you call sense of smell and therefore are simply in that sense expressing it through that sense. At first you will also notice the other senses touch and so forth to also begin to expand as well. Few. Oh, please. Sometimes just to expand and continue the thought. Individuals will more and more feel as though something has touched them so to speak, brushed by them so to speak. And this would be an expression of the expansion of your sense of what you call touch. You are literally beginning to increase the sensitivity of these senses to extend beyond your merely one seining dimension of experience. So enjoy. Yes, I have no problem. I have a strange question. Oh, all right. Thank you. Do you have the being that are in touch with us in the life? Repeat. I don't know what to call them but I am saying being. What I am saying is repeat the question. Use of the channel that is not received. Oh, okay. The beings that are in touch with us in the life. They provide perspectives which may or may not agree with your own perspective so that is an arbitrary thing. They may provide a reality which is simply irrelevant to you from the overall perspective that is quote unquote true but not your particular true. Also sometimes you will in that sense be given information again not only through similarities but through differences. This allows you to establish your own empowerment in saying I do not agree. I do not agree as an empowering notion rather than simply being all right led around by the nose. Yeah, thanks. Do you understand? Do you? The idea is this. If you only agree with everything whether or not your heart of heart tells you that that is not so simply because it is coming from a particular source. You are in a sense disempowering yourself when you do that. Therefore your willingness to stand up and say I don't agree and I am who I am. I validate your right to say that. I understand that it is true for you but it is not true for me. It is an expression of empowerment and this is the common shall we say job of many of the guides in that sense to allow you to establish who you are through what you agree with but also through what you do not agree with. Does that make more sense? Yes, if I am more specific maybe you will understand. It is not about me but if they claim they are somebody and they are not that. I am talking about that kind of line. You always say as then who they are and if they claim to be a certain being and I feel like more that is not true. Can you be more specific and also understand sometimes it can simply be in the spirit of what you call play and fun as well. But can you provide a specific example? What was said that you choose not to believe? I think I should start trusting the feeling I get from the vibrations because I can differentiate between the different vibrations. Oh. Except I think sometimes I am not paying attention. I just go by the way. By what they are paying and then I realize oh this is not the same being that was an asshole's point. You will also understand that society speaking. You still create the notion though you are one whole consciousness that you have many voices or parts of yourself. So very often what you may be experiencing is a part of your own self shall we say putting its too sensitive. Which again allows you in no uncertain terms to say well alright I agree or that is perhaps dated. That no longer applies to who I am. Thank you for pointing that out. You will begin to differentiate more concretely between what is quote unquote an external and I mean this in the most arbitrary of ways contact. And what is simply embodiments within your own mind or thinking. Making themselves known allowing you to evaluate perhaps again aspects of your closet coming forth to allow you to decide whether you wish to have that or do not wish to have that. Which is of service to you that allows you to develop your discernment. Are we getting there and if not please proceed. I will apply this to my situation and I think it will make sense. Oh well we will in that sense speak again whether it is quote unquote externally or internally and as you in that sense employ what I am saying and then get the result perhaps it will be obvious if not we will speak again so to speak. Alright. Yes and I can see that there is no pointing or getting angry because. Well there is a point in getting angry it aligns you what perhaps will not serve you as directly is then judging the thing that you decide when you align is not reflective of who you are simply allow it to be alright. Say this is what I agree with this is what I do not agree with perhaps I feel that anger to show me that I do not agree with this but now that I know that I don't agree with this it's alright for someone else. Do you understand. Oh is that. Oh thank you. Hi. Speaking of the energies I've been feeling a lot of these. I think a very ancient energies around me and I've been sensing them through the elements let's say drops of water you know snow falling wind blowing things like that. Hirement is within you and not the other way along. As you again expand your consciousness you always then begin to realize in that expansion that the reality that you used to believe you existed within exists within you much as waking from a dream. In the dream you are doing it you are within it you wake up and know it is within you. It is as I wrecked and applicable knowledge. Is it possible that I was speaking to Darlene and a friend of ours here on the phone today and we both heard the same kind of stud bump while we were speaking about a certain subject. You are aligned in that and creating a shared expanded. So what's the same energy that we both have. Because that is will occur more in more. Yeah we were speaking specifically about my chamber chambers that I've been wearing case whatnot and it's I think that we both have something to do with that in the past. Absolutely and we found that out to just why that we're going to have. Understand perhaps it will seem in your linear timeframe as a very delayed response but what you were both hearing was literally an echo of the sound that you both coqueous longer. I like to share my last experience with the case. It was Thanksgiving. I don't know I'm a little unfair about it because I feel like I've been having dreams that I have been going there physically. I'm in this thing which is really unusual. Well not really. But this was specifically Thanksgiving and a lot happened. I had a wonderful time. I was taken into the blackness I was in a different position than usual. I had more visions of glittery notions and this time land a land mass started to move into the glittery notions. I started to accept that as being the biggest. A lot of things happened. I opened myself for a lot of past lives. I've received many things. Specifically one was a woman with a raincoat over her head smiling at me. I think about NASA, about the space program, to some degree in the next interact in the world with Captain Abbott. I think something about Mark Twain. I saw an image of a man with a big white hair, white mustache. I thought Mark Twain. And lastly I said I affirmed to myself that I was ready to open the door. So I did. I physically opened a door in the blackness of this cave. My surroundings were green. I accepted that I was, oh I'm on NASA's signing. I came for the acknowledgement. You were there and many others. I greeted you and said I love you. It sounds kind of awkward but we made love. Well in a sense, I know. It is very unusual. But it was moving. I understand that what you will perceive to be the co-created empathy between us. In being a shared in that sense form of consciousness is analogous loosely to what you call your sexual act. Or as you in that sense in your reality with your style of expression in what you call sexuality. Engage and share in that particular expression. You perhaps now, fleeingly or momentarily, are able to experience as the other individual in what you call perhaps the orgasmic space. So therefore since this is how we all continually and only perceive each other at first it may feel similar. So that was an interpretation. Yeah and I also got as a reflection of my own self-love. And you were reflected in yourself in the law of me to be the mirror and I had to be a mirror. And I remember distinctly about as a sonny that I heard the wind in the trees. There was a breeze in the trees. And that was really moving to me. And I asked to be shown around and I was and I saw maybe mountainous areas. And then I said show me other fourth density societies. So we went off into this little scout craft literally. And then I looked at you and I said what was it about those past lives. So we immediately left that and I went back and answered them for you or for me. And most of the things that came up with this big one about that I was a spiritual overseer of the world. And I was a spiritual overseer of building the chamber that I was in. Oh thank you. Now you are being responsible for your craft. And I wore a long robe. I held a staff. I was an overseer and I was more of a liaison to the EPs. You know, through the workers. Do you recognize a similarity in the staff? Most definitely, much longer than. In a sense it is a reflection of it, not the precise idea. And it was really great. And as far as being a spiritual overseer I feel like I perhaps was one of many. But I know where others are I think. And now that you are willing to acknowledge it you will attract in that sense the direct incarnated reflections of it. And may find to some degree you already have no more will I say. So that was specifically last time we spoke about the past life that I should tune in. I believe that you did. It was quite empowering and great. Bring that feeling into this life and you will understand why you are remembering it here and now. And apply it as well to the earlier idea that we had discussed with you the people. Call us forward. Allow yourself to vibrate in harmonious resonance with that view. The embodiment, the expression of that view. Of that past life. That is. I see no similarity but I'll work on it. Well in a sense the unconditional love is a similar. You add in more to that life. What more is there to ask you. I said it all. I know other ones. Some more. You have very nice long hair. In a single brush down your back. Perhaps that is not what you are asking. No, that is great. That is nice detail if I like that. Oh. There will be but a few moments remaining to the interaction over here. This is a five-dimensional what you talked about originally. Oh, that would provide clarification for all. You were talking about unconditional love and that is something that I am finding really difficult to understand. You know love in different forms. Love for love for family. Sometimes we feel emotional and passionate. Sometimes we don't. They just respect. I am not sure what that unconditional love for other people would be like or how it would be experienced. For example, people in this room I can feel a connection with. You don't have any acceptance. There is no sense of problem in dealing with people or talking to people. There is no indication that people say that don't necessarily want to be in their presence. Even though you try to accept them and respect them. Can you give me some clarification on what that unconditional love would be like? How is it expressed? How is it felt? Hey. Acknowledge anyone that you attract. Understand that some will be a reflection of what you choose to embody and some will not. Your willingness to allow and validate those who are not and allow them to go on their merry way. Without needing to carry around their baggage is an expression in a sense of what you have called acceptance. This is not my story. My story is this. Your story is that. Your story is just as fascinating but I do not choose to need to interact with it or necessarily condone it as my own expression or form. However, you have the right and reason to exist. Obviously you are exploring this. See you later, Charlie. Or whoever. Do you understand? Yes. Acceptance. That acknowledgement. And again, utilizing perhaps the verbiage right and reason to exist. It may not be your reason but they have the right to explore their reason just as you feel you have the right to explore your heart. So it need not take the form of all rights, mothering them with hugs and kisses. But your willingness to not invalidate them if it makes analytical sense to you that you have gotten something out of seeing their point of view all well and good, if not, it will later. That type of trust and acceptance. Is that clarified or can we go further? I think that clarifies it as red is to mind something you would have said in an earlier interaction of being able to learn from what is happening in another part of the world. We do not have to experience that. We can see the negativity there and learn from it. We can see perhaps some aspect of their life that we do not choose to experience and learn from it. And as I have also shared, expanding consciousness means it all expands. And since you are exploring polarity very strongly, positive and negative, it would not be expansive to only become more aware of just one aspect when it is always both. So therefore, the awareness of and experience of our two completely different things. The awareness of makes you that much more well rounded. Your choices and your actions which determine your experiences completely up to you. But it cannot harm you or in any way threaten you to be aware of other reality, simply make you more well rounded. So again, yes, that is a direct analogy and extension of what we are seeing. And feel somewhat neutral toward people and still be moving toward the feeling of unconditional love. Oh, absolutely. They can have an action to take it to the opposite extreme that you completely would not condone. But how will you express that? You will express that by saying, all right, you have the right and reason. I choose not to interact with it and I choose not to embody it. Then you have actually used what they have showed you in a positive way. Use everything in your creation even. Now again, you may gravitate away from certain individuals who are choosing to express a reality that is simply not representative of the reality that you express. And that is all right. But when you are willing to simply validate them perhaps having no analytical understanding of their right and reason but that they have the right and reason and then expressing through your own self your preference, then you have integrated and again express a style of appreciation, unconditional love. I will still love you. I may simply never see you again. And once that further, thank you for pointing out to me in no uncertain terms how I do not wish to be. Is that useful? That's right. It becomes a little more difficult to apply this now in my mind to unconditional self love. Well if you say so, but it is completely up to you. It's actually my self somewhat mutually or can I be neutral for myself and be self loving and position for that. And as you begin to express what is truly indicative of who you are through your excitement with your integrity, you will in general build a strong emotional attachment. As you deny these things and perhaps do what everyone else says you should do, you may feel a form of neutrality toward how you have chosen to act. So the more you are willing to embody, express an action who you chose to be. Again, utilizing the vibration of your passion and excitement. The more you will feel that passion, desire, excitement, joy and eventual ecstasy building with it. So acknowledge what you already have. Allow yourself to see what is no longer reflective of who you choose to be and allow yourself to embody, to only act from the center of who you do choose to be. Then you will assure you in no uncertain terms feel that unconditional self love emotionally in the form of complete acceptance and ecstatic joy. The kind of joy of being alive. And the joy of remembering who you are, a creator choosing to express in this reality under these set of circumstances and also transforming them completely within one given life span. The transformational life span that you are within right now. I was thinking mostly of the neutrality in seeing the things that we do not choose to continue to be part of us, not just rather than judging ourselves and carrying around the guilt. But you just view them somewhat mutually and see that as a learning experience. Well, establishing your preference with them. I prefer this, I do not. The thing that I prefer is all well and good, the thing that I don't prefer is all well and good, but the thing that I don't prefer is no longer representative of who I choose to be. So I notice the differences and choose the preference. There are equal choices within you. Oh, thank you. I did not choose to join you in Egypt this time ago, but very strongly attracted to Egypt, but just did not deal with time in this right. Understand that in what you call your dream reality you did. Well, I was going to say I was good with you in spirit. Well, also quite literally in what you call your dream. Can you give me some information on that strong feeling I have towards the gist of this? You also, again, all present in some form have led very strong past lives through which there was the exploration of much of what we are discussing, though perhaps in a much more contracted and limited sense. And therefore there is the identification with your present exploration of expansion itself. Could you be more specific? Perhaps you can say in that particular life you ascribe much of the power in realizing and acknowledging that power to external sources. You sometimes label gods and are now in that sense realizing that they were all merely aspects of yourself. So there is the understanding of the many aspects in common, but the new understanding in relief of the old that now you understand it is all you. Again, I understand this translate in general terms, but this is the overall theme you are exploring. Now, any specific life you wish to tap into, we refer you back to yourself and your own trust in the power of the tool of your imagination. To simply understand that when you close your eyes and think of what you call Egypt, and allow what attracts you about it, how you feel about it to come forth, very elaborate pictures will form and answer your question in a more direct specific way. But this empowers you to become part of the process rather than place it outside of yourself with me. Oh, thanks. You are quite psychic. Thank you very much. Thank you. You're lying? Specifically, were the gods of the Egyptians? This does not only have one simple answer. Many times what are depicted pictorially as gods were particular human individuals. Early on, somewhere what you would call direct atlantic and expressions, which perhaps you can say had not chosen to buy into the degree of limitation yet and therefore had perhaps what you could call longer life span, therefore making them seem many ways immortal. They were not. That is one expression very strongly, that they were again physical individuals, what you sometimes call heroes. But understand that that as the idea of them, shall we say after physical death, then was explored by the many civilizations and many reincarnations of the civilizations, they took on mythological meanings, archetypal meanings, which then were incorporated into the mass consciousness and are now interacted within a variety of ways. So on the one hand they were discreet individuals, on the other hand they were archetypes within the mass consciousness. So they were not directly extraterrestrials. Again, there was extraterrestrial influence, perhaps reincarnationally, more than directly, though there were some exceptions. At a very strong intuition, as I was visiting the temples, that the leadership, the pharaohs and the people of the high level of government, neither they nor the top level priest believed in fact that these entities were completely God. Some did not. The ones that did not in general did recognize, shall we say, the expandability, but we're willing to accept them more down to earth explanation of them. Some actually did. So it will depend. Understand you are talking about hundreds and perhaps thousands of people who are not directly. With the temples and the religious rituals used to focus the imagination of the people and in a sense control them politically. That was not their original intention. They were utilized by the people of the high level priest, and they were not able to do anything. That was not their original intention. They were utilized much in that way. One thing that their original intention was much as the great pyramid itself as forms of lenses for not only electromagnetic, but a pyrric, perhaps you can say, energy as well. Generally the more early versions of these things had a particular alignment similar to what you call great pyramid. Then perhaps you can say, as your society moved on, they simply began to face all right main street or whatever. And the idea of the direction was lost altogether. Yes, that brings the observation that one can not possibly help but notice that in Egypt there's this big gap between the beings who are responsible for building the pyramids and the like and the present Egyptians. It's almost as though those people that were close enough to the inception of these phenomena no longer exist in Egypt. Well in a sense you may understand more technically speaking that what you call the great pyramid will be from perhaps you can say, ten to twelve and a half. Again this is arbitrary and perhaps somewhat fluctuating in the dimensional sense years of age and will predate what you call other pyramids. Was built with very strong Atlantean influence and perhaps you can say the others in that sense were more and less successful so to speak copies. Okay, the direct Atlantean involvement and great pyramid. Hey, die with it. Were there Egyptians at that time that had access to the technology in a sense of understanding and being able to use it, a mastery of the technology that was used to build that great pyramid? No, not really. It was much viewed as miraculous in that sense. So it was as much a mystery to the Egyptians present at that time as it is to the Egyptians present now. Well in a sense you may understand this to be very early on in what you call Egyptian history and to some degree regarded by some to be pre-Egyptian in that what is generally considered the establishment of Egyptian history was when there was the unification of what you call upper and lower Egypt approximately three thousand of your BC years. It's come to my attention that there are some people predate that that will still occupy that area calling them Egyptian in a sense that the misnomer for Egypt is a later shall we say a time of creation, no more. But are the people that were present at the time of the pyramids are there to send it still present and was there some type of written or oral tradition handed down? The idea is more that they spread out and do not necessarily generally, generally speaking remain in that area. Absolutely. Some of you are the ancient Atlanteans as well. I see. It's come to my attention that there are statues and artifacts and the light in the pyramid and in certain samples I think that's made of a substance called schistome. A very, very hard substance that's virtually impossible to cut with our present technology but nevertheless was fashioned into artifacts and statues. Could you comment on that? In general what you would call statues of this nature were added later and can be cut with your present technology. With diamond chisels and the light. At that time how were they passionate? With similar technology that you are sharing chisels in that sense. I see. With diamonds? To some degree. Who fashioned these particular statues? What you would call Egyptian. Again with the land-kin influence? Not really. Again this was later. They were added later. The original pyramid structures contained no statues in that way. Or there was not the idea of the externalization of worship. That was a later occur. Did you have that technology at that time? Very strongly did they have the technology to what you call chisel in stone. It was the origin of schist stone. Due to shall we say lack of translational clarity we are not precisely sure what you are referring to. Well refer to this very, very hard stone. Harder than granite. I don't know where it comes from. And I didn't meet anyone at the age of no work here. They just know that it's present. It would perhaps aid us to have the channel view. We are again not directly connecting with what you are saying. I see. This does not mean you cannot bring this up again in the future. It will actually. No I won't want to have more data. And can I just ask about the past life message between myself and the Egyptian guy Haki. You can ask. Could I get an answer perhaps. Depending on how you are. Pretty please. What was the strongest area of attraction between where were you physically. I was in the temple of Luxor. Thank you. Interesting. Understand both sides of the coin both of you. The ecclesiastical hierarchy in tandem and interestingly enough. These together. We were used together in Luxor. In that sense what we had shared earlier was participated Bible. This time it looks like. With direct connections in path or as. Is this during the same time period. I see so. You are a roving band of. We are fun guys. Absolutely. You still. Thank you. At this timing. Allow me to once again thank you all for your willingness to share in unconditional love yourselves with us. Though we say many times it is not always emotionally believed and understood that interacting with you. Is of as much benefit to me and us as it is to you as we see that many more ways that all that is chooses to express itself that expands our universe expands our understanding of ourselves. This is a great gift and a great joy that you freely share with us and we cannot perhaps in your language express necessarily adequately the gratitude that we feel in the allowance. Again that this is in your society perhaps somewhat an unconventional mode of communication to allow us to communicate and exchange with you in this way. We thank you. We bid you a most fond and loving dream life life dreams. And thank you from perhaps you can say the bottom of our heart for continuing to interact with us. And allowing us to express who we are as well. A fond and loving good evening to you all.
