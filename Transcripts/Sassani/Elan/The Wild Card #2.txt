 Hey, continue shouting. Hey. Um, have an astronaut in the car name. One moment. One moment. In the way that you exactly mean no, as the totality of the soul or being that he was, no. There are, however, and again, not to be confusing, but aspects, you can say of him, that have, in a sense, reincarnated, whereby you can say the majority was reabsorbed into your mass consciousness itself. I understand. Thank you. And thank you. Shitting. Hey. Greetings. And to you. Since Tony isn't here tonight. We're going to ask where we are and who's upon the craft. Well, we are upon or around our own planet at this point in timing. This will change shortly. I am aboard my craft with one other male that we have not discussed, and a female who has not as have yet been named, but will eventually also, from time to time, communicate through this channel. Do you attend circle other planets with your spacecraft besides Earth? It will simply depend upon the exploration and who we are in contact with at that time. Understand that for purposes of approaching a planet, we utilize scout craft. For purposes of approaching a solar system, we utilize what you would call a mother craft, from which our scout crafts are deployed. From time to time, we will assume an orbit for these particular interactions, but that is not entirely necessary. Just happens to be that it is full in that way up till now. But you personally did not give all of your effort of this type to planet Earth. Shall we say myself, I am a bit concentrated on this? You can perhaps say I am colloquially speaking a bit more novice at this than some. So this is shall we say a good portion of my concentration, but not my only concentration. One other particular society that I have recently become aware of, members of our society have been in touch with them before, have an interesting custom perhaps I can share with you. There is a particular animal that they ingest, eat from their particular waters, and it has become quite popular to partake of this particular species, for there is an interesting effect on your consciousness when you consume the meat of this particular entity. And that is for perhaps you can say a few brief flashes or moments when you eat this particular being or entity. You have the experience of seeing through the eyes of that entity. It is fleeting, however you can get a sense of it and it has become quite popular. And I assume that being that you ingest is not sentient. It is similar to what you would consider upon your planet, animal consciousness, versus human or dolphin style consciousness. Yes. Do you do anything else personally in our solar system, other planets that you investigate? No. Now again we have observed physically some of this idea in our particular ongoings, but there is not the concentration for I personally at least are not connected to many of these other levels of dimensionality, understand. For each planetary body that you have, there is by definition consciousness connected to it. Though in your particular dimension of experience, your planet would seem to be the only inhabited one. In some dimension each and every one is inhabited. So therefore right now I am not directly connected to this, but I am aware peripherally of it. Let me switch over three or four nights ago. I attended an update session by Colin Andrews, the fellow on crop circles over from England. Oh right. And he indicated a lot of research was going on by various people on the symbolism of the crop circles and crop circles configurations. Well how exciting what did he find? Well he referenced frequently to various indigenous native groups like our Hopi Hopi Indians, Hopi Indians here in the US and other African cultures and so forth, and indicated some of their symbolism in their culture and how similar it was to some of the crop circle configurations. Well understand there has been visitation in what you would label to be your historical past. So some of this is directly the same postcard. Right, I see. Well then a new element at least that I had never heard before, that he shared with the group that night was, and he showed a couple pictures of, I guess you'd call him just holes in the ground. I think he referenced Switzerland mainly, and these might be in the shape of a cube from the top or a square rectangle. Maybe they were of the mentioned 30, 40 feet wide, maybe 20, 30 feet deep, where the ground, the soil just simply had disappeared and left this cavity left this crater in the ground with absolutely no evidence of any excavation or anything like that. Now do understand that there are some of these that are produced by members of your society, what you would call in Hopi's fashion, but there are some bona fide representations of that form as well from extraterrestrial visitation. Well this is the first time I had heard of this, he indicated that this was not something within the last year, been going on for a few years I guess, but how in the world does that coordinate if at all with the cross circle approach? To some degree in particularly or Switzerland area, it is more the idea of certain effect from the craft itself, rather than purposeful markings for identification within your consciousness, but it can be both as well. There are physical results from the landing of craft, or even from craft coming to proximity of the ground, depending upon what stage of activation the craft is at, will have certain effects upon the ground. I can't resist bringing up the intruders I get that against and I... Oh right, not you too! And I focused on the second part, to what extent may I ask are you personally even aware of what was shown on the screen as well as the content? Well as we have discussed many times when something is within the memory banks of the channel we can access it, so if there is something specific you wish to discuss, we have access to it through this channel. One item down there is, in part two where I happen to watch it more closely. By the way, for those who may be wondering, no, we don't watch it from space. Yeah, yeah. But the physical portrayal or special effects as you will showing the actual ETs, to me was rather impressive and looking. And from our perspective, perhaps you can say of anything to date most accurate. Okay, I just want to... how you felt about that. Thank you very much. In a sense, from our perspective, and this is also a perspective held by the channel, the presentation was excellent. It was within the boundaries and parameters requested, and that is all we shall say. Well, I was so pleased that at one point near the end there was a softening of what had been to me so negative and fearful into a... I believe that this is not evil. But there is a purposeful, shall we say, rationale toward presenting it in the way that it was for the individuals involved in the interaction. Many times, not always, but many times do begin in fear. So to begin to present it with perhaps some of the ideas which may have a fearful effect, gives the watcher some of the effect. And then as the individual symbolic characters integrate what's going on around them, so do you, the perceiver. So there were many purposes, many rationales for the presentation and the inclusion of the symbols presented. Great. Thank you very much. Patrick? Hey. You mentioned that this was the way it was requested to be presented that way. And then I said, and that is all we shall say. But very soon, do understand, and when I say we, I may perhaps be referring to an overall association of worlds rather than Eso Sani chapter. But there is some input on certain levels. And again, from the reticulum themselves. Don't mean to be mysterious. But when we say we are not allowed to share something, there is no high counsel preventing us. It is the higher selves of the individuals in the interaction. So trust your higher self. Hey, Lon. One moment? Is that all? Yes. Oh. Hey. Would we close the counters of the third kind of come from the same stream of energy? It was an early, shall we say, presentation of dissemination of this type of information with many accurate ideas. Because the ending was most loving in that movie, I felt. And of that particular style of presentation, movie versus television, that to that point would be the most accurate representation as well. With perhaps some liberties taken as to the variety of crafts. Since from our perspective, there are no crafts, shall we say, utilizing your slang in the shape of Norelko razors. I have a question about higher selves. Oh, what? If we are just a fine pinpoint of a focus in our life here on this planet, how do you avoid getting angry at your higher self if something is very negative happening to you and you can't seem to figure out how it's serving you? Well, from our perspective, you are not gearing your perspective toward even wishing to allow it to be of service to you. Just asking, how is this of service to me exactly as it is? We'll always yield an answer, but individuals do not resort to that usually at first. So if you can provide an example whereby you actually requested, how is this of service to me? And it was then not obvious, perhaps we can discuss that. But from our perspective, giving yourself the opportunity to ask that question will yield at least some starting place. And again, the way you are phrasing it, you are assuming that your higher self is the owner and you are simply the driver. Now, you are the owner and if you perhaps are angry, perhaps looking toward an external symbolic higher self is another way to externalize and deny your own ownership, whereby saying, how is this of service to me, allowing it to be of service to you? If it is not immediately obvious that it is assuming that it is moving on within your reality and then allowing yourself to see later on how it was of service to you, there is simply not one particular example that we can furnish whereby something could not be of service. And when individuals even discuss this idea with us, it is always our perspective that, alright, that is your one perspective on it. Now here is a positive perspective for the same idea. For all, again, events, perspectives are truly neutral, at least in the sense of containing equal potential for positive and negative. We are tuned to the positive interpretation. You have been, as a society, tuned to neutral, negative, and some positive, but are now beginning to look at the fact that the negative focus is the only thing giving you the negative effect. Asking and ascertaining why you created something does not give a negative effect. It starts a process of self-realization. If that is not clear, please proceed. Oh, no, I understand. That makes a lot of sense, especially with your introductory statement tonight, it all seems to tie together. I would just like to ask you where my mother is, who died in 1976, September. Her name is Aubine Smith. Our strongest perception is that she is reincarnated as a female age six. Because my younger daughter has been having a lot of dreams and connections with my mother, and I just want to ask her. So just because she is reincarnated does not mean she does not have the same soul, and does not mean that she also does not interact in her dream reality. So that is altogether possible, yes. Is she in the New England area of this country? A child? Yes, we understand. Our perception is Southwest United States. How do you perceive sensing things about us when we ask you questions like about our past lives or about the future? Oh, thank you. In a sense, understand, as we have shared, these conversations go on on many levels, and we create ourselves to be cognizant of many levels that we create ourselves in, whereby you create a certain portion of your quote-unquote levels as sub-conscious or non-conversant levels. We have access to these levels and trust what we get from it. Generally, when we then render it to you, you will trust it, but you can skip the step altogether and simply access it directly. So again, it is the aspects of yourself that you do not right now allow yourself total access to, which we speak freely with. And how this also translates into your reality after leading this interaction is some of the communications are made also to your quote-unquote higher self, whereby you may not hear them right now, but when you quote-unquote can use them or need them, meaning you can use them, they are simply right there. One last, thank you very much. Oh, thank you. One last question, will we ever be able to get rid of all the nuclear waste on this planet? And what could we ever do with it to dispose of it or bring it? There are many, many ideas. There is, shall we say, a methodology already existing for the destruction of them, but you will also find your society to begin through your technology to create a particular polymer. Perhaps you can call it a type of plastic-seeming polymer that can contain radioactive waste in such a way that when the radioactivity filters through the fabric or the network of the polymer, what is occurring is that it is rendered inactive. Perhaps you can say simply turning it to another form of pollution, but one that is more manageable. Thank you very much. And to you. Shouting. Yes. Going on, dealing with that question about pollution, about nuclear waste for a minute, it's my understanding that the technologies that some of the brothers and sisters on board the craft tab from various civilizations have the ability to deal with this kind of problem other than creating another form of pollution. Well, understand, we mean that most loosely. In other words, the particles become inert. They are still particles, but now that they are manageable and can be put in a place where they are inert in a sense they are not really still pollution, but understand. It is not our job, meaning the society you are referring to as well, to live your lives and make your decisions. Should you unitize as a planet and invite our participation that is different than we can discuss it? But very often when individuals discuss the increased technology of our societies, they do so from the perspective that we have something to give you that you cannot, shall we say, create yourself. And therefore would save you in a sense with this technology. You are not drowning. There is no saving to be done. It is simply the matter of decisions being made in an individual basis which then allows a collective decision to be made, a unitization to occur, an invitation to be placed, and then perhaps we can share or exchange many of these ideas. But we do not buy into the helplessness of you needing us to the point where you cannot make do without us, and that would be doing you a disservice were we to approach it in that way as your saviors. Right. I was as curious as to what your feelings were on that particular subject. A couple other questions. Now, understand, we have also shared with members of your society, even within these interactions, particular techniques from time to time. Certain ideas of aligning your vibration with the vibratory frequency of your planet and so forth. And with what we have provided, nothing has been done. So therefore, when you will begin to utilize what is already available to you, that will also bring you closer to access to other things. Let's see. My other question is about in terms of the leaking out of information, let's say through the film titled Intruders or through any other types of programs on our media, mass media. It seems as if there can be as subtle as what you call a commercial or an ad in a magazine as well. And you will find the increased occurrences of references to craft, references to beings, references in your funny papers and so forth. Many, many forms. It will crop up even on t-shirts. Are there basically people, obviously people in charge secretly of saying when the media can show something and when they cannot show something? Well, in a sense. Yes. But it seems as if now they're showing more than they were, let's say a year ago. Well, now we say individuals are getting wind of it anyway, so it is more comfortable from both ends since the pressure is being produced by individuals now demanding to know this. There is an alleviation of the pressure by the slow dissemination. Did our judges feel that we weren't smart enough to understand all this stuff? Not necessarily smart enough, but perhaps in viewing, for instance, again, this is quite an antiquated example, but we'll do. The reaction of your society in your early 1900s to your War of the Worlds radio broadcast, that would at least on some level allow them to still think to this day that there would be a degree of panic, although there was no information back then where it has been slowly and subtly disseminated for the past several years, but also to some degree understand that they do not entirely understand the phenomenon, even though there are agreements, even though there is content, so there is still fear from their end about what if individuals found out about this they can even do about it. Well, in reference to this thing, and if there is a clearly defined situation, and your politicians cannot address it, that is one of the ways they are voted out of office, so it is a hold on their own job to some degree. Now, when the intruders film was aired, you mentioned something earlier about how they were given, there was some supervision, I believe, I'm not sure if you're using the right terminology you mentioned earlier, about there was some interacting to come out with the film the way it was. The idea is that you can understand that the interaction was done by humans, but some of them were, shall we say, connected to extraterrestrial sources, particularly and most obviously what you label the detainees, or we label the detainees, you still label them the abductee, but none of them have been taken away and not brought back, so even in your own language, abduction would not in that sense be appropriate, you are only being detained. Well, one thing that bothers me about our media, and this is a few weeks ago, supposedly in the morning, it was about two or three weeks ago, a friend called me up and said, it's 645 in the morning on this particular day, it was on a Wednesday, that CBS News aired a film, a video from Russia, of a craft that was the size of a football field, a square-sized chip, and it was aired in the morning early, and then it was never seen in the prime-time news area of the universe. But this is dissemination, this is leakage, a bit in time, subtle ways, perhaps what you might sometimes label, though not precisely, subliminally. But I called up CBS in New York because I was somewhat upset about the fact that they didn't show it on the evening news where most people are home, and the woman put me on hold for about ten minutes, then comes back and begins to tell me, we don't have time to talk about this, and that was the end of the conversation. Oh, well that can be the form from their particular end, but you need not be bothered, rather rejoice for the fact that it was even done, perhaps set your VCRs and next time, catch it. Right, but doesn't that, some sort of an earth terminology in our thinking, sometimes, at least for me anyway, I looked at it as a media cover-up because it was not... Well, I put it this way, several months ago, even that would not have occurred. So should you choose to look at it as a cover-up, perhaps you won't get that effect, but if you look at it as, look at how much more they can now do, you will begin to see how much more is being done. Could you tell us what that craft represented in terms of civilization? Civilization, in terms of craft you were seeing, shall we say? A smaller mothercraft, very close. You don't want to elaborate on the consciousness, could you tell us anymore, about the consciousness of the craft in terms of the mass consciousness on the craft where they came from? In a future interaction. Okay, thank you. And to you. There will be time for but a few more showers. Male? In the private session, I spoke to you about the motion picture, Kukum. And you mentioned a name for them? Well, the idea is that that was only a symbolic representation, but when, shall we say, shedding the skin and beholding the beings of light, they are, shall we say, similar to what you would label certain density levels of consciousness. From serious, the star serious. Star system, actually. Serious. Okay. But again, it was not a precise representation of serious civilization. They do not come down and don't human skin. What density would they be in? What we were discussing with you would loosely be labeled fifth sixth density, but being perceived from a third density viewpoint, thereby seeming to have a particular form of body. Okay. Does that help? Yes. Okay. There would be someone who is seeing you perform you each other. society will attempt, and I use the word purposefully, to get rid of the negative and go toward the positive. The alignment in that way was an acknowledgment of the validity and the existence and the choice to experience both, but with a fulcrum energy put in there to understand that there is a middle point between the positive and negative, which is a common point to both the positive and negative. So it is a form of centering, it is a form of integration, and it is a form of balance. Whether there's something specific you were seeking. Well, I was wondering if it would be a process that we could utilize ourselves. Yes. And your imagination will color it to change it for your society, if you trust it. It can simply be free individuals standing around a fourth individual in repose and in a sense, utilizing the hands above the body, representing the energies. But also one can in a sense stand for body, one can stand for what you call mind or mentality, and one can stand for spirit and in a sense achieve a balance of those triad, ik, orientation as well. All right. Heidi again. Is that a sense? Yes, it is. Oh, right. And we thank you. A lot. One moment. You may find another way to express this is by drawing the forebeings. One in repose. And you can make an any society which. All right. Will that be all? Human. A lot regarding malle starts. My perception or the faces that are coming through are like a human taking photographs somebody. In a sense. Yes. And our. And the different spaces are from multi-civilization. Sometimes, sometimes many varieties within one civilization for understanding when observing your own society from space, so to speak. You have many varieties of human. We tall, very short, very light, very dark, etc. So therefore, there is a natural variation within many societies. Perhaps you can say ours is one of the exceptions. Can you make a comment on what is occurring from Maui's art at this point in time? We can reiterate that an elaborate tale is being told. A story is being written. You are a bit at a time getting or midwiving in the characters and to some degree have been midwiving in the settings. All as you continue along this process will become apparent and there is no need to force or begin to force the pieces of the puzzle together. It will simply be obvious the state of the puzzle and what pieces will be coming. Thank you. And to you. Sure. As I'm sure you know, a couple of weeks ago, Barbara and I spent a wonderful afternoon with the dolphins down on the Key West in Florida. Yes, we thank you. And in interacting with them so closely, so intimately, is it not obvious what we are speaking of about their sentience? No question in our minds at least. They talk to the staff there at the Dolphin Research Center indicated that there was a lot of activity going on trying to figure out the code to decode, if you will, the communications. Well again, they are going on very physical terminology when they say that and understand that their ability to communicate physically, although is also within your range of perception, also extends a bit above and. So to some degree, there is a built in limitation to that without technology. However, we have discussed this many times. The activating mechanism for telempathy, which is our term for telepathy since empathy is part of the process, is emotion. So immersing yourself with them in the water and playing around in joy creates your ability, a conducive atmosphere to create that emotion and that at first is the ground which you shall meet upon. So analysis is all well and good, but do not leave out the emotion, the energy, emotional component. You have a lot of fun. Hey, so did that? Is there any particular significance to the fact that their brain is physically larger than ours? Does it handle the sonar symptom they use or? One moment. To some degree, that is one of the reasons and also their utilization on an ongoing basis of what you call telempathy. The more you utilize that particular sense, the sense of vibrational discernment itself. Very often the resulting shall we say physiological change will be growth of certain areas of the equilibrium of the brain. I see in terms of number of brain cells, is there any particular comparison you might share with them? Not that we have access through the channel now. As you may know, and I'll do something a little bit different here maybe, and that is the lowest here in our group. So spend time with the same goal up and down there and either lowest or barber, right now may want to ask a question if not, then I'm done but they might have a question. Oh, okay, maybe not. Is it so? No. Okay, thank you very much. Thank you. We thank you for the opportunity and your willingness to facilitate not only with your own exploration, but that of your friends. Are there any questions over here from Pime? Oh, do you have a statement? No. I don't know. Should that change? Please feel free to share it. Yes, I want. When I was a young girl with five or six, I remember being brought out into the yard by my grandparents forcefully because they told me I would see something I probably would never see again. I saw lights up in the sky and I was wondering. First of all, it is not our perspective that you will necessarily never see it again, but you were brought to witness an extraterrestrial class. I was. Thank you. And it was quite obvious to them. The whole neighbor was about me art. It was quite obvious to me. Very interesting. Yes. And although you sometimes believe that seeing is believing, it is also the other way around. So somewhere within you, you already believe that it was at least possible. And we can. Hold on. I have spoken with you quite a while ago concerning the same issue that I'm going to bring up again. Currently I'm taking. How are you doing? Good. Are you beginning to at least begin to entertain the notion that sometimes you will turn with it and you need not judge it? Yes. Oh, I do. Okay. I find that my mental state is such that the medical, I don't know if you remember what it was. Do you remember? Okay. I'm taking currently Secretary of Communication and I'd like to get off of it. Now what is your sense for one of the things that we shared is as you do begin to do, begin to not invalidate the particular phases that you may create to integrate your consciousness quote unquote back together, that you would have a sense of when it was time to begin to wean yourself from that symbol. I would know that. I would feel that. Is that right? So have you had any sense of it? And again, perhaps do you feel better doing it a bit at a time rather than as you say cold or cold or cold or cold or cold or cold or cold or cold or cold or cold? It's just that I have specific rippling of the water, so to speak, in my family. There is the sense that if there is the slightest change of behavior or thought or motion that I'm getting sick again. I don't know. I may then alert you to the fact that they will always thank you or say again then, for you will always change. You will always grow. As you change your beliefs according to preference, you will begin to express your emotions in a positive way. So that is automatic. Right. Now can you simply be willing to do so according to who it is you feel yourself to be and allow them to see who you are presenting yourself as rather than allowing them to set up a mold of how you should be. No, that's not going to happen. That's not going to happen. I'm not going to believe that. I did. I made that decision. That is all it takes. The decision, the willingness to act upon it and then, and here's another key, when they come along and say this and that and this you simply say, all right, thank you. I appreciate you sharing that with me. I can now decide whether I agree with you or not. In this particular instance, I do not, but I am no less glad that you shared it. Thank you. Goodbye. That will lead them scratching their heads. And another thing that's also great pressure right now for me is that I'm seeing someone who is very, very anxious to begin this process. Well, understand you've already been damaged. So alert that individual that you need not wait around. It's already happening. Do it at whatever pace, however, you are comfortable for no one else, whether they are someone you wish to hear from or do not wish to hear from can tell you who you are. Now, they can give you feedback and you can bounce off of that feedback. Yes, I agree. Yes, I don't agree. But everything is of service to you. Or if you agree with it, it bolsters and reaffirms and reasserts your position. If you do not agree with it, it bolsters and reasserts and reaffirms your position. You cannot lose. You always discover more about who you are. You do. It's funny because I was telling my friends Suzanne tonight on her way here that I feel in a way that I have all the consciousness of what it was like to go through 20 years of my life, quote unquote, normal and then suddenly 15 years later be taking these drugs and the side effects that they have. But understand, from our perspective, it is not a matter of being normal or not normal. It is simply a matter of the fact that at some time along your path, you decided to not be not normal, natural. Normality is arbitrary. It is a viewpoint. It is only relative to something else. But naturalness is normal for you. So begin to get in touch with what is natural for you and only you can know that. But if something comes up and issue an emotion, a belief, a thought, you can take a pill if you wish to squash it or you can look at the thought. Look at the belief. Look at the emotion. Realize, first of all, that your wild card is in your pocket too. So therefore, you can take anything, the belief, the emotions, negative thoughts and even apply the wild card to that. How does this serve me? In the instance of an emotion, as we have shared, emotions are always, always, always, no exceptions, a response to a belief. So if you have an emotion which is unacceptable, oh joy, there is an unacceptable belief attached to it. And you can't change that belief until your first acknowledge it. Denial is the first thing that holds it from you. So therefore, you can use it in that way by saying, all right, I feel just awful. Acknowledging it's all right to feel this way. Perhaps I don't prefer to, but it's all right. Now that I feel this and am trying on these clothes, so to speak, what must I believe to feel or what must any person believe in order to feel this, then you'll come up with a belief. I do believe that and I don't prefer to, but I will acknowledge it for that is the only way I can change it. Oh, now that I know I believe that, I would much rather believe this. You now have in front of you your new belief and all you need to do is extrapolate from the new belief. When trying on the new belief, now how do you feel? Now you will feel differently. It's the preferred belief. You will have a preferred emotion. You will think different thoughts for now you are happy. You think different thoughts that you create upset or you create happy. And therefore you will definitely act differently. So if you allow your imagination to provide the mold, the template for your new belief, how you would feel if you had it, how you would think and how you would act, you always have in your mind a guideline that you can check back on. All right. All right. I feel that old emotion coming up that I used to have when I believe this. Now in my imagination, I will picture myself walking down my street with the new belief. How would that me act in the same circumstance? Oh, wow. Your imagination to provide those pictures. Once the pictures are provided, do it. That's it because it's from a different belief, emotion and thought. The actions will be different. And when you do something different in the quote unquote same situation, you can't help but get a different result. It is only the same assignment of meaning and the same attitude and the same action which seems to create the repetitiveness. And then yes, perhaps it is more attractive to swallow appeals to forget it. But if you address it, then once you have in that sense unraveled it, it is gone. It is unraveled. And I just, yes. And I just said this quick note. I don't want to take a lot of time. Now you are a gift. We have said before, you cannot take time from anyone. You are all creating it anyway. They will create their time. You will create yours. But it is no accident that you are speaking with exactly who is present. So understand that what we are sharing with you and what you are sharing with us is observance to all. And boldly proceed. Thank you, An. I would understand after what you just said about five minutes ago that healing comes through understanding, creating and accepting our own belief system. Well, through some degree. And it is also the allowance of wellness for health is the rule and sickness or disease is the exception. Right. So it is simply an allowance of the restoration of your natural self. I come from a very large family. I have seven brothers and two sisters. And my mother and father were extremely very strict in bringing us up. And I can remember so many instances of just trying to be who I was having to just leave my home completely take a walk on the beach because we live by the beach, come home and somewhat do something with those feelings of anger and sometimes even hate toward my mother for being so rigid and unwilling to look at another point of view. Oh, but that was believe it or not of service to you for it helped you establish and firmly reestablish who you are. And you can actually take it a step further. You can allow her to be who she is just as you are asking that she allow you to be who you are and do so unconditionally without even demanding that she allow you to be who you are and go even one step further. Thank her for allowing you to come to these realization. Thank her for allowing her to provide a symbol that you are now choosing to use rather than store in the closet. Does that make sense? You will leave her scratching her head as well. Yes, one more thing. I love you. I love you. Unconditional. And thank you as well. Is that a service? Yes. If there are other specific issues, please share. Or in that sense, we can also interact with you in your dream reality. In a sense, loosely speaking, we understand they are closed, but when you are dreaming, keep your eyes open. All right. Yes. Thank you. And we thank you. And send our greetings to your friends. Thank you. At this time, allow us to once again unconditionally thank you all. Understand, we have said this before. We will share it again. But of course, we all know this is the first time. You are of service to us exactly as you are. We would not want you to be anything but who you are for. We learn the most by who you choose to be, not who we would prefer you to be, which is not even within our belief systems, for we do not prefer someone to be anything other than what they are. So you are our wild card as well. And we thank you.
