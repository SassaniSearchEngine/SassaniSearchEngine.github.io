 Oh, I don't say continue. Shit. Oh, man. It's the show. I was going to ask you, do we have guiding forces working with us in our lives like guides and angels? Shall we say? Everyone has the availability of associates' souls on energy that have, in that sense, chosen to remain non-physical and which may, in that sense, be, shall we say, available for dialogue. However, recognize that you, as we have said, create your own reality. And therefore, they will not, in that sense, interfere in your chosen reality. Therefore, the mechanism, most often, that they will communicate to you through is what we have labeled a loving nudge here and there. Your attention being suddenly diverted to something which may remind you of what it is you are exploring or searching. If you wish in that sense to dialogue, Mar, directly with your guide, simply close your eyes. Breathe, relax, allow yourself to, as you say, center. And then, speak dialogue. But remember, a dialogue is a two-way street, as you say. So therefore, if you are speaking to your guide, be sure, in that sense, to allow the dialogue to be two-way, leave a space. So listen, if you will. When you will, listen in that sense, that is what you label, meant to actually. And the again, key being, where you get something to validate it. If you're saying, oh, that's just me, it shuts down the communication. In a sense, it is. You, for you, are the conduit. You are, in that sense, the middle man. So it is you, but in general, not just little old me. So if you will, again, validate what it is you get, you can have that type of dialogue. And then, again, again, reality in which you can interact with your spirit guide, which they may seem to be a bit more physical to you, is within what you label your sleeping dream. By simply, when falling asleep, requesting such an interaction, you can invite or invoke that guide to walk in the same space with you in that way. However, one other suggestion, when you do so. Very often, when doing so, this does occur. But you do not grant yourself the permission to bring it back as a memory. So when you invite them, also affirm, if you will, that you will allow yourself to bring back a symbolic memory of that interaction. Now, when you open the memories you bring back, we'll be but a shadow of what actually occurs. For you bring back your memories through the framework of this existence. So if things occur in the non-physical state, in the quasi-planar state, in between physical and non-physical, there may not be the appropriate symbols to bring it back out. Very often, when individuals say, I did not dream last night, that is what is occurring. Now simply not having the symbols to bring it back. But you always create the dream reality when you are, quote, sleeping automatically. So simply you all dream in that sense all the time, but do not always allow yourself to bring back the memory or have the corresponding symbols to represent the memory. If for instance, you are in your dream state to visit our planet, shall we say, I'll apply it as a bit more alien than you might imagine. There are things upon it which from this framework, from the forgetfulness you have imposed upon yourself, would have no frame of reference. And thereby you would bring back some symbol in your reality of it that may not actually in any way represent the actual experience, but it's the closest you can come in bringing it back. So the very long answer to your question is yes. So you have to ask another question. Oh right. You talked about geometric forms in the corn fields in England and other things. It affects the symbols. Also, we hear about UFOs adjusting people. Is there something to that? Oh right, yes. But we prefer to relabel abduction to temporary detainments. More in fact, all these interactions occur only by agreement. On some level, remember you do create forgetfulness of your agreements. But if it is happening to you, that is your sign that you have agreed to it. In a moment. And also, individuals in general are not taken away. So in that sense, they are not literally abducted, simply temporarily detained to live out, agreed upon, interactions. And there are specific and varying societies in touch with your society, though the symbol you are speaking about most often is related to a civilization that stems from a star system called Zeta, particular. Rosie? The children, millions of children that are missing out on New York saying are any of them taken by the way that you mean no. Now, that does not mean that there is not some type of exchange, but in general they will not be children that are already born. In that sense, when there is that type of exchange, where by shall we say there is a co-creation between the two societies, that again is by agreement and never forced upon anybody. Right. May I ask a personal question? Oh right, you can ask. Is vegetarian in a good way to live, or does it matter if we eat animal fish and sour? And also with cholesterol, I'm vegetarian, my husband eats meat and everything. His cholesterol is normal, mine is so high. Oh, then you see that the symbols are not as literal as you have been wed to believe. Do understand, when asking us if something right or wrong, we simply do not contain those terms to us it is either relevant to our reality or not relevant to our reality. For we validate all reality, even those that we do not prefer, we understand they are valid explorations. You have created upon your planet the idea of eating meat. From our perspective, this is in full agreement with the entities that are, quote, eaten. Now we recognize that this is a bit foreign to your society, however that is the mechanics of what occurs. In that way, you have the opportunity to eat meat if you desire. You have the opportunity to not eat meat if you do not desire. What we however suggest is to not invalidate the one you are not doing. Does that answer the question, or can we be a bit more specific? I would like the answer to the cholesterol problem. Well, do understand again that everything that you create is done so through your beliefs. So the simplest answer to this, and again, may go against the grain of many in your society, is that cholesterol will only have an effect on you if you believe that it does. So therefore, you are creating that effect. In a sense from our perspective, the rising cholesterol is not the cause of the problem, however, simply a result of the belief. Do you read on your plan? Not so much in the idea that you label. For we directly exchange energy in our environment, but shall we say when we do, for we retain the vestigial ability, we eat very simple foods that contain everything that is needed, and there is not so much the variety that you have created upon your planet for that type of variety, is not one of our shows and exploration. How many planets have mite on them in all the galaxies? Shall we say approximately 63 million in the immediate galaxy? As far as if you want to be technical about the entire of all creation, infinitely good. Might the green know it? I mean, if you know it, various forms and styles of life, but what you may label intelligent life, yes. Now, recognize there is that many billions of stars. So there is a dispersion of these civilizations, and it may seem in the narrow way in which you have created to view it like it is balanced. It is not where you show it. How many visits is balanced? Shall we say minutes, but you may consider that most closely you are in that sense interacting with three to five civilizations. Shall we say for now we will name but three? Four, our own. That from which you labeled Zeta reticulum as we have stated, from the Crayanian star system and from the system you labeled Crayanian. The Crayanian's energy exists primarily upon fifth, sixth, and seventh density, so in that way you would not see them as physiological beings. And in fact, the light being that you often hear spoken of, although there are many that are represented in that way, in general upon your plane, are from the Crayanian orientation. They are also white in contact, shall we say, with your dolphin civilization upon your planet. For when scanning your planet for intelligent life, we do not come up with one species, but to human, land human, and ocean, cetacean, dolphin whale. They are, as you are, sentient beings with the ability of self-reflection. However, they are far more oriented toward for density consciousness, although they still have, shall we say, roots and thirds. When you will begin to recognize them as an alien civilization upon your own planet, which shall we say is somewhat, somewhat rare that two alien societies would live on the same planet being so different. We will then become the vibration of a civilization willing to interact with other civilizations. So before looking in that sense to the start, looking in your own back. Not as you are labeling. However, shall we say, in other dimensional realities, there is life upon that planet. However, in the dimensionality, you consider your own, then it's not. In the sense that you mean? No. In the sense that a similar scenario is now being played out without the choice being one of destruction, for we perceive that your civilization, although differently oriented, is at the same or similar space as that Atlantis, and you have decided on mass, which is one of the things that enables us to communicate with you, not to blowing yourself up. And we thank you. There is not very many reasons that we would ever interfere with any society, for we are, shall we say, non-intrusive or non-uptrusive to the maximum. However, the one exception to that would have been had you decided to blow your planet up by nuclear means. Four, by doing so, by destroying the actual physical planet of yours, you begin now to rip into the fabric of other dimensionality. So in that sense, when it gets out of your own backyard, it becomes our concern also. So in that sense, your devices would not have worked in the way you think they may have. And that would have been our version of introduction. And your leaders already know this. Very aggressive. Well, the leaders of all the countries know far more than you imagined about what we have just stated and about our existence, or they know, since your 1947 years beyond the shadow of a doubt, about the existence of extraterrestrial lives. And because you have empowered them to handle your fear, do babysit for your inner-s sense. They have decided that you are not ready. When they feel that you are on, you will begin to find out about this information. Our sense is that this may begin to occur next year of your time in a limited way. It will, in that sense, begin to leak out in an indisputable fashion for those who have chosen to be on the earth to experience that. Those who have not will, in a sense, be on a parallel earth that does not, for everybody always has the choice. And all realities will be playing out. When we speak to your name and meditation, may we feel your presence, your energy? Oh yes, but do you understand? I have no name as such. This is simply a physiological symbol chosen through the original channel we had come through to allow for an identification you feel upon your planet is necessary. To be more precise, if you will, by allowing yourself to be within your meditative state, as you have said, the way to key in my energy most strongly, quickly, and effectively is to hone in on how I or this interaction allows you to feel. For emotion, energy motion is the activating mechanism. One other useful aid if you will is to picture what you lay in a like triangle or a tetrahedral filament, which is a pre-sided filament with a triangular base, making it an asensate, the both-sided, and a tetrahedral. Those are representative of our stream of energy and may be used in that sense as focusing symbols of that health. Yes, thank you very much. Oh, thank you. I love that. Shae, Bashar, do humans on this three-dimensional level ever reincarnate on urban planets or in particular on your planet? No, and your people reincarnate here, not in general, no. It has occurred, but more for the idea of establishing for us enough commonality to communicate with you. So in that sense, you may consider battle anchor the other physiological channel as my pap self, my life upon your planet. That allowed me, by living that life, to have enough language, enough conceptual information to have the difference in our species be bridgeable. Upon your planet, there is a tendency to keep reincarnating within your society, for you have set up a seeming cycle of repetition, cycle of reincarnation. But it is not etched in stone. You actually impose the cycle yourself, each and every one of you, and can reincarnate elsewhere if you design it. If you know, it's an option. However, recognize, you have always existed, and therefore you are not quote native to your Earth anyway. This is simply shall we say your latest explanation. But in that sense, you are from nowhere and everywhere simultaneously. And this begins to seem a bit confusing because it is an infinite concept being rendered down in a finite sense. But that helps. Yes, thank you. Just one touching on something that you mentioned too. All of them. That we were everywhere and continue to be everywhere. Are we multi-dimensional? And there was like, I'm not even here talking to you now, but is there another part of you somewhere else in the universe? Oh, very literally. You exist, as we have said, on all levels, simultaneously. One of the idea of the noun is from the perspective of all that is, is that everything is now, everything is simultaneous. It only does not appear that way to you now because of what we have spoken of earlier. Time. So therefore, you are choosing not, not to experience the simultaneity of your being at this time. As you have chosen that, and now begin to experience what you have chosen, seeming like this is it, and live it to the fullest. Is that what the system? Yes, thank you. Oh, thank you very much. Sharing. Of course, do not that. Hey. What does the portion do to that reincarnation? In a sense, and we realize this may be a bit hard to accept again to many police systems. That too is by agreement only. And the entity, again, by definition, nothing is ever imposed upon you, has a degree in that sense to not culminate the birth. Certain entities, for instance, one example might be, may choose to experience a degree of physicality without actually having to play the whole thing out. And in general, that will be one of the manifestations of becoming physical for a but a short time. The other idea that although what you labeled karma is self-imposed, many of you do not realize that. And because you feel that it is a law, which as we said, there is only one law, and that was not it. You feel that it is a law and believe most strongly that it is? You seem to experience it in that way. And many individuals, shall we say, delegating karma to themselves will experience that reality. But it always makes sense. Nobody is ever being squelched from reality. Simply it also allows your society to view many issues, obviously. And this is of service to the society. If people could but validate the other viewpoint, then you will have peace, however. Does not mean you have to condone it. Does not mean you have to live the viewpoint you do not prefer. But to allow it to exist as a valid reality, as another choice that you simply have not chosen, puts it back in your lap. So, that's all I throw. Can you be a bit more specific, which you seek? I'll cut you by a minute. Shady. Shady. Can we talk about the energies of Sedona and whether or not, I believe that there is an energy system there that one can vibrate you. Are your energy systems power spots on the northeast coast where we are now similar? In a sense, though not as what you would label intense. There are, due to the flow of electromagnetes. One more. In the way that electromagnetism does flow, in a sense, loosely speaking around your planet, is in certain currents. And there are certain places where these currents, in that sense, cross. And where they do, you experience and enhance the synergistic and additive effect. Sedona is one of those areas, as are some other areas on your west coast. There are none in that sense as strong in this particular area, though there are a few. Then I'll show you a bit weaker. However, being that all condiment space is simultaneous, as you have pointed out, you can always resonate to any of those four to see, for you have within yourself seven such vortices who have labeled chakru. They are simply the same thing, points of energy within your body. And they are in that sense somewhat physiological, measurable. Percy? I just wondered if you would name one or two better here on the east. Some of the channels become aware of that we have in that sense, vatify. Is located within yourself very kinetic opinion? Thank you. Thank you very much. Shady. Speaking of electromagnetism, feel in the way that there's been controversy through what we call the 1950s here, that electromagnetic wave that damaged the immune system and caused cancer in many cases. Oh, but it's good out of the ages. May I be dressed? No. The words that are given off by substations that you create by like the power plant do not harm the physical manifestation that we've provided to the end. From our perspective, no. Again, a neutral symbol. You may, if you wish, join that club. But that is all in the sense it is, any of these beliefs, these, these labels that you buy into in a sense are joining that club. Therefore, if you believe most strongly that your son causes cancer because your ozone is breaking down, you will allow yourself to create the evidence that this is so. If you do not believe that and recognize that your son is the central star-seaved man in the O'Sola system, without which life could not exist, and therefore by extension, you must have a natural relationship with the son and ability to absorb whatever energy will be beneficial and not absorb that which will not. You will have, shall we say, a more natural relationship with that central team, not and not mean to create the negative scenario, for they are not from our perspective inherent facts, simply a set of choices of something for you to believe it, similar to what we have later in the question of all. Therefore, again, to answer more succinctly, yes, individuals can create that as an excuse to create bad health, but inherently is not so. And in fact, existing within a line, electromagnetic field does allow your physical eyes being to line up and within that alignment what you label physical eyes disease, at least at the time that the alignment is occurring, cannot coexist. This ease can only exist in an underlying structure. So I will ask you what do you choose to create? Oh, then simply when you think about electricity, start off a line. And allow that light to illuminate your consciousness. Not far away. Hold on. Sure. Sure. And to you. I had two questions. The first one is number one. About five or six years ago, I was striving my knees and her friend, who was a school and we saw a UFO. This car. It was covering right above tree level. And it was random light, flood light, circular, very large. And I pulled the car out to the side of the road and we opened the sun up. I don't know what the timeframe was and I don't recall the timeframe except that it seemed like a long time that we were there. And then I feared, took over me that I was protecting these children. I was responsible for these children. Oh, that is a typical, by the way, reaction to the seeing of our various craft. A, fear, fullness. Because you now force to the surface many things you have hidden by being presented with the fact that there are things that you have not seen that actually exists. What is your question? Well, the question is, do you have any more information about what that UFO was or if say, as I don't recall the timeframe, was I participating on another more level than just observing it? Yes, sir. Yes, sir. But may I ask you before and again, I elucidate a question. How did that interaction allow you to feel and what have you since done because of it? I was really excited about it. I told a lot of people about it. I read people of communion probably because of that experience. Oh, recognize it was not those beings however, but personally. Who was it? Rosie, and perhaps Michelle Shannon. It depends upon what you say. How does that allow you to feel and what does it allow you to do? It allows you to believe that they exist, number one. All right. We just... Probably the first time that I had... Nothing else really comes up as far as participating, but then I'm conscious of it. It's not that I was conscious of the timeframe. There was something different unique about the timeframe that I experienced. Oh, in general, the time frames in those experiences do seem to halt. And we shall, in this instance, provide a label. In general, we do not... We do not want to box an individual into only accepting the certain parameters around that label, but we feel in this instance, by in that sense, in part to use a label, it will point you in a certain direction should you find yourself continuing to be excited about it. And that is plea idea and in all of this. All right. Thank you. Question number two. Question number two is my mother left the physical body 20-something years ago. I was wondering if you could tell me if she's reincarnated and where she is or who she is. Not me? I know you can't tell me exactly. May I ask you a question? Yes. Do you think we already have this conversation? No, we had it about my grandmother. I thought it was basically my mother left her. Along with her. And I was a teenager. Name? Name was Dorothy Erisi. Age of time of transformation. 41 and a half. All right. One moment. That's interesting. Our perception is reincarnated male age 15. Living in Montreal Southwest and that is all we have to share. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Share it. Could I ask about my son who was killed about five years ago and where he might be now? Again, you cannot. His name is Alan Gregg and he was 27 when he died, 1986. Are you aware of any communications with him since? Only the immediate summer after he died he appeared to me in our camper trailer but didn't say anything. I mean, I just only saw his head and I just wondered where he is right now and what he... When you saw in a sense that had what feeling did you get? Although communication was not established, what did you feel at the time, Addison? I felt very concerned because he seemed to be concerned about me and I didn't want him to be concerned about him. And indeed this was the idea. Apparently you have similar emotions for each other. For what was being communicated is that I am okay. And indeed he has reoriented into that new reality. He is viewing things and eating and assisting individuals on what you might label a spirit guide level if he still chooses that has not yet been decided. Now again, you can dialogue as we have said with that individual in your dream reality and your meditative state. But again, it is not necessarily if you are awake that you will hear his voice communicating back. There will be subtle ways in which an individual will communicate across, shall we say, that, quote, value and that will be again subtle ideas. Your attention for instance being drawn toward a certain interest that he had allowing you to feel the feelings that you have between you. And so forth much more of that symbolic type of communication and much less others dialogue. Have you in a sense experienced that type of communication? Yes, occasionally you were the landscaper and were having some landscaping work to be done in our yard. And when the machine arrived today I had very strong feelings that the machine very much liked the one he was killed on. Very good. And if you will validate those feelings and recognize you are feeling them because that is communication from you by validating that. You open up the doors to more communication. But recognize you have chosen to be healed. He and that sense has chosen to be that. Not to mean this than any type of a. In something way. But individuals in that reality have, shall we say, better things to do than to hang around waiting for. So therefore by being who you are, choosing to live the life you have chosen most fully, when you need to have the communication they will be there. When you do not you need not be concerned. Can I ask you one more question? All of. Because of a lot of the things I've experienced including his death, there's been a great deal of fear in my life. And I feel like it's got, I am stuck in a position right now where all these things that I'm learning metaphysically are wonderful. But I can't, I just feel like I'm stuck. I can't get past. I believe system. I'm trying to form some kind of a belief system and I don't know if belief system is the truth. If you will use the fear recognizing that you have created it, you might as well use it. By determining what you must believe to be fearing in any of these given situations, you will enable yourself to trace back to the initial belief. The changing of the beliefs that you have born into that limit you will change your sense that you are limited. But you are doing the limiting. So allow yourself to trace back to what are the issues that you are using to limit yourself. Why are you feeling now? I am asking this in a rhetorical way. You do not have to answer it within a large crowd. You can if you wish. However, the idea that this is pointing you in our direction to pursue all your own. Is that a system? Yes, very much. Do you have another question? Andrew, 40, you answer. We stand in touch with you. I don't really have to explain it except that. Oh, just go right ahead and it will come out perfectly. I have always been very afraid of the extraterrestrial being the one that talks about in communion. Since I have listened to a couple of your tapes and I talked to Richard about it, just recently, three weeks ago, just before waking in the morning, in a kind of a dream state still. I saw these faces in front of me and I was very excited. Are you the people that I am supposed to be talking to? At which point, it is almost as though someone touched my head and there was this instant spinning, terrific spinning inside of my head and I woke up feeling, wow, this is incredible and I did not feel so frightened anymore. I wondered if this was a message from you to help me to get rid of my fears or to... In a sense, it is a message utilizing our stream, however, from yourself to yourself. And you, in no uncertain terms, were the one that transformed the field. So, thank yourself. Thank you. I am happy to provide a reflection to you of these ideas, but simply will never let you escape from the fact that you have created it. Right. That's what I'm trying very hard to deal with and to get rid of. Hold it. Do not have to try so hard. Simply relax. When you try very hard and hold things and try to force things, you do not open yourself up. When you relax your grip, then you form a crucible that will allow receptivity. The tightening up, the tension closes you down and simply by breathing deeply and releasing, you can lighten up. It is that simple. There is nothing to be afraid of and endless, but recognize that you choose to point out, and you will not release to yourselves through your feelings. If when they come up rather than saying, oh no, I'm feeling what must I be believing, you will be amazed. It's worse every time if you allow it. There is nothing between the conception of what it is that excites you and the playing out of that thing. For the excitement in and of itself is your indication that you contain all the necessary tools, all the necessary resources, all the necessary knowledge to do that thing. It is your very sign that you have the free requisites. Therefore, use your excitement in that way. Validate your excitement. The ultimate way to validate anything is to act on it. So act on your excitement and you will, instead of seeming like you are on a path, be the path which you actually are on anyway by definition. All right? Thank you very much. Oh, thank you very much. Jeez. You're kidding. You're kidding. You were both together. I have two questions. Would you tell me where my father is playing Gibson Carr? If the auduce say, Oh, I know he's not. What about auduce? That will be here transformation. Oh, by roughly 12 years ago. a guy, approximately the age of eight, and his name's Gippon Carr, he was about fifty-six years old. May I ask you a question? Sure. What with this information, a while for you to do it? Why in that sense is it necessary? I've gone through a rough spell in my life right now. He was close by, I think I was struck comfort from that. I love the question. If he was not, would you then still be able to function? Yes, I'll still make it. So what you are really saying is you'll be okay, either, why? Right. Oh, why? As long as we have that straight. Okay, my other friend. One moment. In that sense, we are not getting much. Though what we do perceive is that he does remain at this time non-censical. When indeed we only get that, we simply trust that that's all you need to hear. Question number two. Chris Kirsch is in messages for me right now. All we are receiving is to love yourself. Oh, my God. In that sense, doing so, the way to express self-love is to grant yourself what excites you, to recognize you are worth it, you do deserve it. And that is all. You answered my question. Okay. Thank you very much. Sherry, I'll debate. Okay, I have a series of short questions. All I have is duties. How much short story writer? How much life do you have to do? I wouldn't say, thank you. What was new that my reality and my reincarnation before this one was in the future and on a distant planet? Oh, very, very, very, very, very, very, very good. Well, it's not very, very, very good. If I do not know the name of the... You are laying down the rules, proceed. I would like to know the name of the planet, the solar system is located in, who I was, and what I did there. And why that's so important to me now, what am I supposed to be doing here because of that reincarnation? Alright. First of all, we will have some backwards. What you are supposed to be doing here, your side, your purpose, again, is always available to you through your excitement. We have explained that so we will now move on. In other words, whatever does excite you is your purpose. Period. It is that simple. You do not hide your purposes from yourself. It is that you have not been taught in your society that your excitement is an indication of your purposes. In terms of the planet and the precise things you are asking, we feel as though you have imposed a forgetfulness upon yourself of these things for a reason. Therefore, before we answer anything, if indeed we will, tell me what knowing that allows you to feel now. I feel that if I know that, then that will allow me to remember the things that I learned from there that I can use here to help both myself and other people. Only. Recognize. Timing. Means. You will have those tools, however, because you create time only when you need them. Then for you have made yourself aware already of some of those tools, and as they are necessary, they are there if you are willing to admit it. Secondly, very often there is purposefulness in imposing forgetfulness upon yourself. If you always were consciously aware of every little detail, you would have no sense of focus. It would all be far too confusing. An analogy we have used is the driving of your car. If you get in and are so concerned with which gear goes with which gear, and when you press this, this happens, you can't drive. However, if you will go in and drive the car, you do not really need to know all that material. In fact, it would distract you from what you are choosing to do now. Now, it may seem to you as though we are skirting the issue. We are not. We are only allowed by your higher self to share with you that which your higher self will allow you to share. And in that sense, although we have a sense of what you are saying, we are not allowed in that sense to share it. Other than saying this, you have a very accurate sense. Indeed, you know what you need to know right now. One interesting aspect you will allow us to explain, however, is very many people in your society believe that reincarnation always means going to the next line. The next line. The next line. It is only called reincarnation within a timeline for only reincarnate when you have the conception of timing. In actuality, more appropriately, the mechanism is called multiple simultaneous incarnations. But from a time-line viewpoint, it seems like reincarnating, however, because it is all multiple and simultaneous, there is no necessity to go in any order. And very often, individuals will incarnate backward in time for various reasons. It is no accident. You are speaking to me now. It is no accident that you have become aware of my civilization. That is all I shall say. And simply welcome you. Thank you very much. Do you have another question? Yes. Oh, I would like to publish my writing. Go on. If you are in a practical way, I can do that. Me suggests sending it out to publish it. And recognizing that it excites you is not using a rejection as evidence, simply waiting for the timing to play out to you. Get... Why me? Why not? It is no accident that it was you. Hold on. Trustee. Okay. Who has been trying to contact me from a distant place over the... About 30 years in the spring and summer, there is a very strong beam of consciousness coming in my kitchen window. Where does that come from? It comes from, shall we say, an arm strength. One you have lived many lives with and for particular reasons have decided within this lifespan, if you will, for one of you to remain non-physical and the other to be physical. You are in that sense working from both hands. Wow. I like that. Oh, my gosh. Let us point out one other thing for again. Our orientation is you create your own reality. All this information was available to you without me. Again, it is my pleasure to function in this capacity. I love it. It excites me. I do it. However, I must, by definition, always point you back that by asking yourself the same questions and being willing to validate the answers you give, you would have gotten basically the same information. Therefore, the elaborations you make sense, I have not given you, which incidentally on other levels I have, you can now begin to validate your own imagination and answer your old questions. When you will be that bold to be who it is that you are, you can then come to the end and share that with me taking your question mark, straightening it out to an exclamation point and making it a statement. I love that. Oh, thank you very much. Go right ahead. Thank you. We will in that sense also. Love it. And we thank you. It's a sharing. Sure. Great. Two questions. Over one. Have I experienced other lifetimes many times over with everybody in this room right now? Shall we say you have all the experience? I have experienced many lifetimes. In fact, on this planet, thousands. The ones, however, and the reason that that seems to be overwhelming to us is they are not all relevant to this life. The ones you will perceive in this life have a degree of relevance to what you are exploring now. And those will be the ones that have an entity to have what we may label bleed through. In that sense, we will remember what it is you need to remember, what it is that will be of most service. But understand, whenever we answer a discussion about past life, mutual lives, alternate lives, parallel lives, we always do point out to you that you always have everything you need, everything in this life right here, right now. So that may wind up being interesting, correlative information, but it does not in any way enable you to do something you cannot already do. So therefore it is a nice exploration, but not necessary to proceed. In general, when an individual is excited by a particular period in history, that is indicative to that individual that they were reincarnated in that sense, in that time span, and that that particular incarnation is somewhat relevant to this life. What are your immediate senses in this regard of what life has passed through it? Yes, what are you attracted to in your history? Oh, definitely Ireland. And the old West, Ireland, Rome, everybody good? Or? Then those three are the most relevant. If you will in that sense, colloquially speaking, go out on a limb and ask yourself some more questions about the specifics, you will get the answer rendering my job absolute, and recognize. My job is to put myself out of a job, for if I am doing it right, you won't need me in this way. Is that another question? Yes, the second one was enough. I'm asking this question in relationship to having the answer just validate something and have a sense of already. Oh, right. I'm a writer and I think there's a being that I write through sometimes called Ar-O-Lan and the science fiction that I write. I was wondering to validate that that was an actual being somewhere, I have a sense of where the planet is, because that's what I wrote about in the book. I want the validation from you. In the sense that you mean yes to this? And in fact, I would not have been able to answer had you not first validated it within, because that is how the mechanism works. When you inwardly validate any idea by extension you want to see an outward reflection. When you invalidate any idea, you will get an outward reflection of being invalidated. So therefore you allow me the willingness to validate that for you in that sense, validated it for yourself and we thank you. I have a question related to that. Oh, right. Only ladies question proceeds. If I create my own reality, or I like creating my own reality, I created the being, the channel cruelly, I created that. In a sense you became cognizant of that which already exists. It's not like I made him up, he already existed and I love that. In a sense you created your version of him and you may say that that is what you created. Okay, so it relates to my question, the actual being was something like I even created a body out there in the universe somewhere, it was there and my version is the one I created. Okay, very good. And you can dialogue as we have mentioned earlier with that individual. Very good. You may find if you do, he will provide some of the dialogue for your books. Die right now. He does. Is this a position? Yes, you answered the question exactly. Oh thank you very much, but it allowed me to allow you to answer the question. Okay, so 17 years ago this June I was separated from a child. Oh, we're living. You tell me how he is. We're not here. In a sense we will give you what you call up, relabel, and apology. This is not in our sense. Our domain. However we said there are others who can be of assistance to you if you will but allow yourself to attract them in this way. Again, it is not our domain, but there are others who can be of assistance. How would I know about hiding in him or to go in his way? Have, as you say, the clear intention of establishing that and to get all the balance. It will be attracted to the details, will take care of themselves, simply having that clear intention and acting like a person with the fact. Oh thank you very much. And it will seem to happen through what you are able to do. So it may not be something you can even keep your eye out full. That is why we phrased it that way. All right. Okay. Okay. Smile then. You mentioned before about guys. Is it the same guy for all dimensions? In a sense shall we say we label it all that is, before we feel that is a bit more descriptive. There is one all that is. Is that what you are asking? People create in that sense different versions of that one all that is. But their versions by definition are contained within the totality of the all that is. Therefore your biblical literature went by the statement and I will paraphrase for it is not completely within the memory of the channel. I am thy God. Thou shalt not have other gods before me. Did not mean that there are other gods. But simply meant that there is nothing other than the one. Anything else you perceive any other gods cannot be before the one for they are within the one. Does that explain? Okay. Oh man. You do not now satisfy. The last statement you said the new gods are now in the one. Or other gods are in the one. In a sense the simplest colloquial explanation that we can give is there is one all that is. And people will draw different versions or aspects from that one whole all that is. That will be of most service to them at that given moment. Thank you. Are we unnecessarily concerned with the ozone equation? Is there going to be a discovery made by some scientist that will solve? From our perspective allow me out to shed with you the earth is far more malleable than you have imagined. Although it has an overall diffused consciousness it could also be considered a self-aware sentient theme. It has the intelligence in that sense to monitor and organize its environment far more than you realize. In that sense it is holding back doing so to allow you to discover a particular thing. But all I will say is this the earth has the ability to replenish its ozone in a way that your scientists are not aware of. And if the mass consciousness belief system of your planet will allow it to do so it will occur within your life span. If not it may have to wait till your life spans or over with in order to do it. There are some scientists who have the theory that inject hydrogen or something. It is unclear to me his theory that the idea is there are artificial ways to build up the ozone. There are certain things that fall into the domain of this is your planet. And therefore we do not in that sense interfere with the specifics. At this time however there are specific reasons that you have chosen not to know it and I will not tread on it. But the idea being there are both artificial means and natural means. The natural means in and of themselves are sufficient to do the job. The artificial means are not necessary but your society may allow yourself to create them to take back some of the responsibility for the symbol of the breaking down of the ozone that you as a society have created. And therefore in that sense the earth is allowing you the opportunity to do what she colloquially speaking can do so that you yourselves will realize you have that ability. Does that make sense? I think that the scientist has a theory that if he will chip away from an arctic ground he will thereby be able to replete the ozone. It is not our perception that this is so. However, again we will not interfere. And when we interrupt to do watch that chipping away. For sure. I'm beginning to orient myself now to the idea that this is a multi-universe and presumably therefore this is a multi-earth we're standing on. All we're sitting on. And there must be fabulous stories about the planet that we're not aware of. That you are aware of. Perhaps you could share one with us. Now at this time however we thank you for asking me. And we'll say in your inner future there aren't few surprises from our strength. For particular reasons how there are but a few moments left to this interaction and not the appropriate amount of timing to do so. However we thank you and allow you to replace your question that we would not answer with another question. Okay. Thank you. All right. The inner literature. Well we have the Jehovah and the God Yahweh. Are these one of the same or the difference or what? Our perception though they are different if you will versions of the one God. Different ways or filters through which people have seen the one. All that is. All right. Thank you. Sometimes. Environments of a negative aspect in the ones you have named or what else. One of them. Yeah. Recognize again that all that is is all that is all the positive all the negative and the integration of the two. Nothing exists without all that is. It is all within. Question on that. What are you through? Thank you. One other quick question and that is I've heard a theory of the 12th planet. A planet that sort of does not have the same orbit as the other planets in our system but has a strange elliptical orbit that only brings it into proximity to our planets every two or three thousand years. In the sense that you mean it in what you consider a planet now. Okay. All right. We have time for about one more show. Share. One moment before we do make that to male. Just the question I had was about Ramthik. They call him a guy. You all are in that sense. Because you create your own reality. You are made in the image and life is of God. God is multidimensional. Infinite and eternal. So what are you? Therefore the terminology God may be applied to any individual. Your unwillingness to accept that idea and feel it is last for the in that sense shows you a gauge of how much you believe that. If you do not, it seems most outrageous. We understand. No, see? I have a question. And I read a question. This is something within the next year of your time in a few months down the line as you say that we will be doing with the physiological channel if he will do it. Allowing some representation of our music to build this room. Literally. Share. Share. Share. Would you just confirm to me that my son is a part of it every time. He left this mansion June 13, 1986. It's just a separate week, second. In that little transformation. Oh, he chose a very genetic, horrible accident. One more. Doing okay. Send as well. Thank you. Oh, thank you very much. At this time, we wish again to express our unending appreciation for your willingness to think that it even might be possible to live the life you prefer. From our perspective, this is a given. You too can learn if you wish to feel that way. You are never in any situation within your life by accident. If you perceive that it is an accident, it is a situation that you have created that you are not willing to own. Recognize one of the things you are exploring within your society is time and timing. At the beginning of the interaction, we have labeled different ways to create the time you already create. Separate from that is the idea of involvement, unfolding according to chosen timing. Therefore, we spoke earlier about trust. The idea that you always have 100% trust. Using the theme of it's about time, it is about time that you began to trust your timing. Begin to do so and things will not seem like they are happening to you. Since they are happening from you anyway, it is available for you to feel that, to live it. To have it be more than sounds nice. Again, the key will always be your willingness to act, to apply anything that excites you. To recognize your excitement, to recognize your belief systems and change them is all well and good. What allows them to transform is your willingness to prove that you believe it by doing it. Actions are the ultimate proof that you believe something. Therefore, go beyond mentalizing and step into action. Allow yourself to do what it is within integrity that excites you the most at any given moment. You will begin to lead the life you prefer. Needless to say, if you go from one exciting thing to the next, you will love your life. We do not say this to tease you. We do not say this to Dangle and Carrot out in front of you. We can only communicate this to you, not only because you are able to hear it, but because you are able to apply it. We should only do one thing. When you begin, when you will begin, to apply what it is that does excite you. We promise your reaction will be, it's about time. We think you are most fond, atomizing, good evening. Thank you.
