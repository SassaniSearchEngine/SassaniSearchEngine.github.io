 All right, I'll say continue. Shelly? Yes, the child. I'd like to ask if you have information on the different dimensions that are here on our own planet. We've seen you have an asteroid on a call to train along that. Do you explain that to us? Do that move like a third and fourth density of our own planet? Is this sense? In a sense, the idea is far more than it is part of, have you say, your chosen third density experience transformational force. Therefore, by definition, when transforming from third density to fourth density, one of the ideas is that you do. Allow yourself to take those portions of yourself that you have, shall we take, banny? And what you have conveniently labeled your subconscious? And one at a time, allow yourself the opportunity to bring these ideas to the surface, not to again rebury them, but to integrate them, to understand them and figure out where it is that they fit according to the being that you now are. And within this accelerating understanding of yourself, you will discover more portions, those of which you speak simply being some of the components that you have as a whole, 100% being broken yourself down to. Does that help? Kind of. For whatever clarification you desire. Okay, so different dimensions on the planet itself are actually different dimensions within ourselves? Yes, in a sense, realize any way what you label, different dimensions, different times track, past lives, future lives, ultimate lives, parallel lives, all existing simultaneously. One of the aspects you create within your third density and to some extent, although far less, when you do transform to fourth, is the idea of time. But realize empirically, time does not exist and is a creation, a creation of and from each individual choosing to participate in that type of reality. From the perspective of all that is, from the perspective of your higher self, everything is simultaneous. So in a sense, we are all top dancing with semantics. Does that help? Yes. And we carry that into explaining actual travel for the same degree, all of your consciousness leading your body to journey to other places. Thank you very much. From our perspective on this side, your consciousness is not within your body. Your consciousness is the... One moment, your body is the manifestation of your consciousness. In a sense, your body does the reason I within your consciousness. The idea is this. You are consciousness, you have for the purposes of this discovery solidified and machining sense, your self, into a solid being. However, at any time, within your own choosing, simply you can realize that your body is within your consciousness. All creation is within your consciousness. So from our perspective, viewing your consciousness as a bubble, and the idea of your body and being in the center of the bubble, that from our perspective, you do not travel anywhere. Simply close the eye of your consciousness from the center of your bubble and open it somewhere else within or on the skin of your bubble, giving the apansity of travel, the apansity of separation. But in a sense, it is all within your consciousness. Does this help? That's a new direction. Yeah, that helps. Well, thank you very much. Simply by allowing yourself in a meditative state, switch, van. Your self, in a sense, again using a bubble as a symbol. It's only a symbol for that are not the boundaries of a bubble within your consciousness, but again allowing yourself to expand so that your body is not the entirety of your being, but your being contained also the idea of your body. And then again, opening your eyes, so to speak, in another part of that bubble, you will find that in a sense that gives the apansity of having traveled from your body. But in a sense, again, it is within your consciousness, your body, and not the other way around. Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much, Sherry. Yes. Hi. Hi. I have another question relating to my earlier question. And that was what role or what part does sex play on your planet and how do you engage in sex? Thank you very much. Very much the same way that you do. Although far, let's hope, when we spoke before, the idea of the absorption of the energy of food into directly our being, it is somewhat that same idea with the idea of reproduction, that it's still because we are still physical and therefore exploring physicality, the idea of some physical reenactment of an act as you say. However, it is far more an energy exchange from being to being, and within our planet, we are always consciously in communication with the entity as you say about to be born. So in a sense, it is a three-way involvement instead of the idea of a two-way involvement. However, there is being again to feel physical, the idea of gestation. Although, whereas your gestation period upon your planet will be, as you say, nine of your months, ours will be the idea of what you label seven of your month. Also, the birth of any individual upon our planet is not in any way, shape, or form, painful. Partially because, and due to the fact that the entity being, quote, born is very participatory in the process. This is available to your society by simply enlisting the idea of the health of that individual. You can't have what you call, endless births on your planet. Now, your willingness to accept this idea or your lack of willingness to accept this idea determines where along the line of believability you lie, and therefore determines your likelihood of experience in an painful or non-painful manner. Does that help? Yes, and the first question is the sex act engaged in only to produce children. Not really, but again, it is a difficult analogy to make. There is from time to time in a spontaneous fashion the idea of that type of pleasure, but not so much within our planet anymore, and again, far more in the aspect of energy exchanges, energy sharing, for we are moving from physicality. But earlier, as you say in our history, yes, was not just for the idea of conception. However, because our entire civilization no longer has the need for language, because we do telepathically communicate, and as you say in touch at all times with everybody in our civilization, shall we say, and you may find this a bit interesting, when one does experience that type of pleasure, shall we say, it is in a sense felt by all. Thank you very much. Do you have another question? My thinking about how that one is that you wouldn't have the need to because of your exchange and our intelligence. Yes, for from time to time, for various reasons, if it excites an individual, these symbols are, as you say, still available. Thank you very much. Can you stand a little bit on seeing this child first? I'm just wondering if you accept that as a belief? You choose that as something that you would believe in. What's the effect on that? It's your surroundings by a medical community and people in the room with you that aren't accepting that as a belief. Again, it is determinant upon your ability to realize that you create your reality, despite whatever symbols you have created around you. For if you are in that situation, you have created yourself in that situation. You may therefore allow them to, as you say, quote, influence you to believe that you must have pain. Therefore, giving your power to them, or you may provide for them a reflection that there is an alternative, despite, in a sense, what they say. Therefore, providing to them the idea that such a thing is impossible, introducing that idea to their consciousness. But again, the way to promote this type of painless birth is to again enlist the help of the soul being born. If the soul being born is shall we say somewhat unaware and not in communication, things can be a bit shall we say tumultuous? Shall we say shocking, surprising, jarring, ripping, etc. But that is merely a creation of lack of communication. Some of the ideas upon your planet, most recently within your history, involve the idea of under-water birth. This idea can also be helpful, not that it is necessary. Another idea is there is a whole other species of aliens upon your planet. That being the idea of the dolphins who will, they, if you do choose to perceive such an idea and observe them, as you say, giving birth, which is available upon your television from time to time, then you will see a sparkly exam of joyful painless birth and in a sense, because those beings are telepathic, those beings are as you say intelligent, you can't enlist help at aiding from them both directly and to the individual being born. If you are able to have, as you say, birth within war with dolphins, this is one way. Another way is simply to become an telepathic communication with them. They also aid and assist you in this way as well as aiding and assisting you within your dream reality. That is one of the functions they have chosen within your reality. Does this help? Thank you very much, Ed. Good. One moment I was about to ask, if your planet was entirely and have it by female? Thank you. In your plan as opposed to ours, do you have the same home-grown problems like first of all, officials and life-taxes or stuff like that? No, we have the idea of no governmental structure whatsoever. We do exist in, shall we say, a very different focus in what we have chosen to explore than you. Although we have an ascent involved to this point, it was never quite the same way out on our planet as it was on yours. So again, delineating upon the steps we have taken to get this way to come to get you, for there were no per se steps to be taken. However, because we exist without what you call doubt of any type, we always have a 100% shock that whatever is in our reality is what belongs there. We realize there are no extraneous creations. Simply all individuals interact with all other individuals on an equal basis. Realizing if they are in contact with that individual, that will be a greater service to all. There is never any shadow of doubt about these ideas. So upon our planet, there is total harm, total shock, total unconditional love. We love each other for what we are. Not for our fellow conditions that we would like an individual to be, and then we will love them. We unconditionally love each other. This enables us to circumvent the whole idea of governmental structure, the whole idea of war, the whole idea of crime, war. We also understand the idea of abundance that we have delineated to you, that we always have what we need when we need it. We always know what we need to know when we need to know it. And one moment. We also find out if we have the idea of you label money for we validate each and every term performed by each and every individual to be equal. Therefore, as you say, the closest idea you have within your society as to how we do exchange would be, though not exactly, the idea of bartering systems, the understanding that something is needed is provided. If someone wishes to provide something, then it's somebody who does need it. Everything is exactly understood to be one thing, manifesting in a multitude of ways. That is a connection. Therefore, we don't make the separation to begin with. We do not. Shall we say, invent power to any one organization to rule our affairs, as you say. There is also no fear on our planet for that nothing to fear. There is no violence. Does that help? Yes. Do you have another question? Thank you very much. Thank you. Please expand on the idea of processes in that it's very comforting if we could ask a question and say, in the case, when am I going to sell my house? We had a date. Our expectancy and our work for is that selling the house would not be so difficult. So the problem is it seems to be very inaccuracy. What are the problems with short-term, long-term processes? The idea is this. There is no such thing, empirically, the idea of prediction of the future. Simply sensing taken at any now moment of momentum, which may be likely to occur. However, when presenting to somebody the idea of the prediction on the process, that in and of itself can change the energy sufficiently to not presuppose that that reality must come true. A lot of the processes that have been made, and in fact have come true, since we have that momentum behind and upon hearing it, enough individuals did not wish to not have that reality and therefore not transform it. But you will find that the idea that you have labeled processes from your ancient past will be less and less accurate as you need the word accurate, but there is no inherent accuracy that is no background in reality. In which you compare to one thing to another as being accurate, we don't deal with accuracy. We simply deal with validity. But the idea is you will find now that the transformation is in full swing. Now that individuals are choosing positivity and realizing that you do not have to, shape down an old reality, and live trials by by in order to build up a new one, many of them all shall we say, cataclysmic properties, which have been predicted, have less of a momentum behind them to be true. To simply add, all futures exist. All of them, any possible future, any possible path, and in fact any possible presence, does exist. Your actions in the present will determine which future you do experience. Therefore, this is why we have introduced the idea to you of realizing that the measure of who you are, what is most you, is what excites you. And therefore, by proceeding, doing what excites you, you do line yourself up with, shall we call, a preferential future. Does that help? It does. What I've heard in assuming then is that our difficulty in dealing with the concept of time, which in effect does not exist, we have no reference points to deal with. One moment, don't you realize as a creation, you can experience it in a real sense, proceed? In our conscious state, we do have a different approach, I love it. Being that if there is no time, all the futures are already manifest. Yes, for us we have said everything is simultaneous. Then one would assume that it would be almost easy to look at a man in best future, however the complication arises in our problem with time discipline. In a sense, the idea is to have clean intention of what you desire, but do not place upon it rigidized parameters that you will only accept it in a particular way. The more general that you can state your intention, and the less rigidized parameters you place upon it, the more you allow the universe to deliver it to you, the quickest and most efficient way generally proceed as a coincidence in your life. Rather than saying you will only accept it in a particular way, but when you do that, it is not that you can't get it that way you can, but generally when you are imposing these parameters, you are not looking at the overall picture in such a way to realize that in order to get it just the way you desire the particular rigidized way, it will take a lot of time. Therefore again realize that abundance is what you need when you need it, accept abundance as it comes, accept your life as it comes, clean positive meaning from what is already there. Do not try to push things away. There is no place to push anything to. It is all you. Can I push it into yourself? We will bounce back very hard. Is that of assistance to you? What kind of a clarified, or issue on this matter? If I was able to formulate a better question, perhaps I am sure you could answer the question. Thank you very much. Do realize in a sense, usually our answers are somewhat limited to the clarity of your question. So simply figure out exactly what it is that you wish to glean and be as shall we say pointed and specific with your question, then we can be pointed and specific with the answer. But realize anything that you have heard is exactly what you need to hear. Therefore you can glean very much from what was just said. And in fact, upon listening to this information upon your take, you will realize that each time you do listen to it, you hear a slightly different nuance of what was presented. The information is structured in that way. What we have labeled at work is situation of information. Thank you very much. Shannon, it's how I want to say viewpoint is that the experience and the experience of the diet has amongst the health professionals. Again, realize everything is belief system. Therefore, if you believe me is bad, vegetables are good, they are. However, what we will do, many, is this idea. Everything is composed of the idea of vibration. As you do accelerate and transform from third to fourth density, you are anybody real sense raising your vibration. The fruits of the idea that you label fruits, that you label, vegetable are shall we say very light material of high vibration. Therefore, within the idea of accelerating your energy, if your belief system is such and realize this is key, you will find that the ingestion of these vegetable fruits of fruit will aid you in lightening up and in a sense allow you to feel and lighten. However, this does not mean we are saying vegetables are good, meat is bad. Everything is sacred in history. There is no accident. One of the things that individuals upon your planet have chosen is the idea of experiencing the eating of meat. Can you, when you make your choice as to what you do, validate everyone else's choice and reality? In other words, if it turns out that your strongest propensity, your excitement lies behind the idea of being vegetarian, can you then allow yourself to, as you say, live and let live amongst the idea of system in your society in such a way to allow and validate others that have chosen to eat meat as being an equally valid reality? If the answer to this question is yes, you will actually derive the most benefits from your chosen lifestyle. Again, validating your alternatives and realizing that you do not prefer it, but it is perfectly valid. Now you can create, as you say, a bunch of offshoot-boy systems about the specifics as to why one thing is bad and one thing is just, but it is all-boy systems. Does that answer the question? Yes, I have one more question. I'm about to take a big step here to my girlfriend and open a health resource. How are you signing? I think. Alright. And I'm wondering what your feelings of this, in this society, will be, but with you, my official. And how do you know when you're able to go into this situation or to take that kind of... Does it excite you to go into business? Yes. Then our answer to your question is this, don't either have adequate time. You will yield the reality you desire. Simply move into that space, as you say, in total trust that because it excites you, it is a most you. Be, will provide whatever abundance is necessary to continue to do what excites you. And see, will lead you to the next thing which excites you. This is the mechanical principle of which we speak. Does that help? Yes, thank you. Thank you very much. Sure. Yes, for sure. I'd like to ask if you have animal life as a plant life on your planet. Yes. Is it like ours? Shall we say it is similar? There are differences, but you would recognize it as such. Outlanded at this time, because two-thirds of all population at any given moment are living upon what you say is spacecraft. As upon it at this time, though, no structure and as many as you would say, part-life, our mothership, the large vessel to which we do inter-dimensionally travel into universally travel, have the ability to land upon our planet and pull out of a better terminology. When necessary, if desired, if it excites us, dismantle itself into structures and there be reassembled for, as you say, flight. Thank you. Thank you very much. We have time for about two or three more. Please share and share. I'd like to ask you about using the reason board. Is it okay? Is it okay? Is it? I don't know. What does your police listen to sign? Yes. Then it is. And it is that simple. Validate how you feel for you are a part and parcel of all that is. Treat yourself with that same respect. Realize it is because you say so. Because you deserve it. That is conscious commandment. And, as a vendor, it is a way, an acceptable symbol with your society, for you to communicate and open up a dialogue with other portions of yourself, all the consciousness. Therefore, if you do truly feel it is all right, go right ahead and you will have that positive manifestation and outcome from such an occurrence. There are some presence in this room at this time, and we'll tell you, it is very much fun. Also, all over in your society, you have used that symbol generally with two individuals. You can also, as you say, use it with one. You better try. Does that help? Yes, sir. We, as we have said, do allow our stream to be deemed your planet and can very easily be, shall we say, reached through those means. If you dial the number, we will pick up the phone. All right. Thank you very much, sir. Yes, sir. Are there other alien or active stress fields that are in contact with us from the morning? Yes. At this time, presently, we are only in contact with your civilization and have any loose fashion. However, your governments do know of the existence of extraterrestrial. Not only do they possess the idea of statecraft, the idea of alien bodies, as you say, from, as you say, crashes and various phenomena. They also have been directly in dialogue with several civilizations. The ones we will share with you at this time, sent from the start of systems, data, reticuli, that is a main group of beings that is choosing to co-create with your civilization at this time. In fact, they are the ones that you have related to the idea of what you have called abduction, what we prefer to call temporary detainment. However, very often, the fear generated in those interactions is simply the individuals involved in degrading. For fear does bring what we were saying earlier, portions of your consciousness to the surface that you may now choose to integrate rather than rebury. Another civilization, very strongly in communication with your civilization through many individuals, stems from the start system you call Pleiades. Does that help? Sure, that's great. There are a few others who are not, and shall we say, a direct communication with you, but both these civilizations are within, shall we say, a group of civilizations to which we also, in a sense, belong, there are no dues, no membership. However, colloquially speaking, what we have labeled the association of worlds, and it does label between three and four hundred different civilizations. Presently, we sense that your civilization will let us then join the association within the next ten to fifty of your years. Also, we perceive now using the energy available now, realizing what we have said about predictions, that within the next two to four of your years, much information will serve in your media that will, shall we say, bear out what I am saying. The idea that your government is already aware of our existence, one of the things that may facilitate this to the shorter end of that time is your willingness to get involved, realizing you are your government. They are not an extension of you, they are you, therefore you can directly communicate with them by simply letting them know, via whatever communication you can creatively imagine, that you are big boys and girls now. You are ready for this information. There is no reason for them to protect you, but there is nothing for you to be protected from. You will not panic, you will not run in the streets, or rapidly. You will facilitate greatly with this process. We have suggested, not in any way she perform immediately, that you do, and are not take this approach of approaching your government and allowing them to realize you are ready. But what we perceive at this time is two to four of your years, indisputable information, arising within your society, for this is part of the acceleration you are part taking in. Began, 43 of your years ago, in your nineteen, forty seven years. That is when your government knew, beyond the shadow of it out, about our existence. Do you have another question? Yes, I do. What is the purpose of the association of the world? Simply the exploration of new aspect of all that is, we are constantly, shall we say, welcoming the idea of experiencing that much more that all that is has became. Therefore, there is not so much a hierarchy, a governmental structure, as it is a sharing form, the ability to share many viewpoints, the ability to relish other civilizations of process to reality. Yours being one of the most highly focused that we have come in contact with. Now we do not mean it, that I am totally, and realize the overturn of the word mastery. But we have labeled your civilization because of your choice of focus. Your focusing the idea of exploration of limitation, as the masters of limitation. Therefore, that is the propensity of your focus. And we relish it greatly from time to time. When we have shared the idea of your existence with other civilizations, shall we say we have met with the closest thing that we can label as disbelief. That a civilization would choose to forget their connection with all that is, and in a sense feel that life was happening to them rather than through them. That it was one civilization in specific that we had closest to what you would label in our arguments, but not exactly, for they would not believe such a thing. Once we have presented to them the ideas of the reasoning behind some of these ideas, the ideas that when you forget your ecstasy, when you forget your connection to all that is, that enables you to explore and discover things as if anew. But when you are connected with all that is, and know everything, the idea of discovery is not a part of that exploration, everything is already known. They then, shall we say, as they sport, as they have been, purposely began to experiment not to the degree that you have with forward getting their connection. And shall we say upon that particular planet, and has become quite a humorous pastime. Does that help? Yes, thank you. How do you go about sharing that information with others? Do you meet or in the same manner that you are sharing with us right now? In the beginning shall we say, stages of communication, we have found this to be most conducive. For in the past shall we say one time, a civilization was approached not by us, but by another member of the association, a little too quickly. And shall we say, both races were very, as you would say, the most humanly affected by the international. Therefore we now choose this less obtrusive way of communication. But once these civilizations does realize their power, does realize their willingness to accept the idea that there may be other life out there, we do meet with them face to face. And in fact the civilization of which we have spoken to, which has no straight, relatable name within your vernacular, we have had that interaction face to face. Thank you very much. We have nine four, one more share and share. On the chart? I was wondering what kind of lessons you would go through on the planet as we're exploring limitation or a little bit of the explore. Thank you very much. Simply, we are exploring the many different ways to experience activities. The many different ways that be one thing that everything is made up, manifest, when we do discover another civilization such as yours, it enriches us beyond measure. One moment. And part of my own particular focus or function or as you say, interact in these types of exploration, these types of interactions with other civilizations. Again, realizing both within our civilization and without our civilization, the many wonder its ways all that is has manifested. Therefore, that is another focus of exploration you may embark upon. Even this time of your time, do not have to wait. Realize as you do, except many of the ideas we have shared with you in terms of everything is all one thing. Therefore, everything is sacred in this city. Realize that whatever happens is sacred in this city. And then acting upon the opportunity that the conscious recognition of sacred in this city has brought you and realizing that the present is not a result of the path. Those principles are the main principles that once you have adopted will allow you to rather than be transforming from third to fourth density, being in the fourth density. We at this time thank you very much for your willingness to co-create with us this type of share. For as we have said, it enriches us beyond measure. It allows us to see all that more many ways that all that is has of expressing itself, of exploring many aspects of itself, including imposing upon itself, great, limitation. And then transforming those limitations to limitationlessness. We realize that our ability to communicate with you at this time means that your civilization is very far off into these ideas. You may also see this symbol upon your planet. Simply look at the last clear floor of your years, your world situation. Not saying that our still things you don't wish to transport, simply that many walls are breaking down upon your planet. Many things that you felt would not occur or could not occur within the time frame that they had in terms of unity upon your planet is occurring. The last several years have been the proof that you have gone, that you are transforming. It would have taken many tens of hundreds of years to make the social quote progress on quote that you have made in the last 10 years of your time. Your current situation in your world today is an example of this idea. The fact that although an individual is choosing to act out of integrity and in the past you may oppose this as a great threat to your well-being, the effect we observe in your society is that time is the idea of the feeling unprecedented unity to not condone this individual's activity. Think about it. Again, neutral situation, your Kuwait, but you may look at it either way. Negative clarity, here's another insane war or an positive clarity, look at the unity, look at what the world will now condone and not condone. You may look at as you have called for a playable racism upon your planet the same way. You may say, oh, it is still there. People are still hating other people. People are still prejudging other people. Or even they say, the far more obvious symbol now is as these isolated incidences do occur, there is far more less, far less power of these ideas, far less willingness to condone these ideas, far more outcrimes. Against condoning these ideas, we feel you are in full swing of the transformation and look forward very greatly to the day where you, upon unifying yourself upon validating yourself as self-empowered individuals, do form the mass consciousness, the society that will enable us to meet you face to face. Not that that has to happen, it does not. Not that we will be very disappointed if it does not. Simply, we trust that whatever happens will be perfect, but it is our quote prediction, sensing from the energy present now that this will be a reality. And we do greatly look forward to embracing you as equals and sharing with you as equals. Then we may enter a next phase of the dialogue in which we can glean enrichment from you. And you can get shall we say our first handed idea of our existence. We thank you again for your willingness to create this call interaction and also suggest to you to have you say, keep an eye out this evening of your time within your dream reality. For this is very really the dimension which you would perceive us to exist within and we can communicate with you with your allowance only within your dream reality. So should you desire such an interaction on a personalized level, simply give yourself that suggestion before you as you say, go to sleep and we will share with you a dream reality this night of your time. We thank you very much for your willingness and say to you, a most fun and loving. Good evening.
