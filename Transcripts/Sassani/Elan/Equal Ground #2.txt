 Oh my god! Oh my god! I'm kidding! Beshar! Are you having a good time? Yes! Oh! Yes! I'm sorry. Yes! K-dore! I have a friend like the name of......of a gay Mexican. She couldn't be here tonight. She had a number of questions though. And she asked for your pointers perhaps, if you'd like to give them. Maybe. Regarding her health situation, she has diabetes. Regarding her fellow, she's interested in. And whose name is Zig. And to me she seems like a very powerful entity with unlimited potential when she needs someone walking. As you all are! Thank you. So any pointers that I might relate to her would be appreciated. All the ideas of what you have labeled upon your planet, diabetes, is from our perspective. A symbolic of, and an extension of, a symbolic extension of the idea of......one by below... We are having some difficulty with this idea one moment please. Because we are being, and within our civilization, is the idea of that. We always need, we always do know what we need to know, when we need to know it, when indeed an idea comes along. And, although we are speaking, we receive no information about that idea that we do trust that there is, again, a positive reason for the knowledge being inaccessible at that time. I suggest that one of the purposes of the asking of that question was for us to request you this idea to, shall we say, try out within your reality. That, if in the middle of your sentence, you forget what it is you are saying. You did not need to know and should have the trust that idea. If, as we find happiness continuously, upon your planet, you, as you say, lose your keys. There is a reason for such an idea and it is a climateizing to these situations with this approach that does enable you to proceed in positive action and not allow anything to ever be what you have labeled and impairment in your past. However, we do remind you that from our perspective, a path is not something you are on, a path is something you are. What was the second question in regards to, say? Well, she, I don't know exactly what she was asking. She was asking, I suppose, for a sensing of whether this is a productive relationship for her. In a sense, we do not mean to skirt the issue. This is a question which only she can answer. Therefore, if the opportunity arises for our interaction with her, and she phrases it in her way, that may allow us to access certain information. But right now, under these circumstances, there is really nothing to be said by us on the issue. The idea of diabetes in your society is symbolically representative of an individual's feeling of inability to absorb. In the physical instance of the diabetes, it is a physical inability to absorb and process the idea of what you call sugar. However, all physicality has roots in mentality, roots in intention, roots in consciousness. So you can extrapolate that idea a bit further and suggest to this individual that she do explore not which she feels. She does not have the ability to absorb, for she does. Does this answer the question? Yes, it does. Do you have another question? I guess a historical question. And that is that when the black league, this is going back quite a way, I know, with a black league separated, it became a distinctive unit. What was the factoring involved there? What catalyzed the separation of some from the many? Three foods. As this idea is not particularly relevant to all those present. Similar to the idea of what you call upon your planet, revolution, uprising, upheaval. Much darkness had been in that system of which you speak for a long time, as you say. And the initial phases of this negativity didn't even include an individual's ability to realize this was even happening to them and that there was an alternative. The catalyst, as you say poor, that uprising was the idea that there was an alternative and that they may in fact have been giving away their power, which shall we say slowly accumulated within the mass consciousness, within that system. Does that answer the question? Indeed. Thank you very much. Thank you. In the beginning of this year in 1990, I quit my job. Very good. How did that allow you to feel? Well, I wasn't sure at first. I knew it was the right thing to do, so I created it. And then I trusted that I would give me what I needed, and I want to give me what I needed. I would give him food, and I would give him my rent money somehow. You accepted your old abundance in which you have or for the chosen, you deserve yourself, then, good. And then I scored a career possibility, and I was given a career, or I chose a career, or a job, which I would never have expected to choose. Divine. I'm human waitress. I went to college for four years. And because I don't understand, are these ideas considered in your society mutually exclusive? Who remembers from our collective and upon our family, is going to equal weight in all the idea of what you call the profession, or when we have not such a bond out of one. Right. And I believe that that's just one of the lessons I'm supposed to learn from receiving this. Very good. And I can also see many of the other lessons that I learned through this job, because every moment I am given opportunities to see everyone's equal, I've given opportunities to change negative beliefs that I have within myself in the positive beliefs, and I can feel that I'm transforming through this, and I can feel an energy awakening within myself to something new. But now I feel it, and I'm trying to get part with it and accept it, and I've got a code. And I don't understand why I chose to become ill, because then I can't share my energies at this time, because I feel very weak and physically. And I don't understand why I chose to- Does this, as you say, call to prevent you from your old occupation? No, it's still going, but I don't feel- I feel- I feel like I can't give all and I can't give. I feel two weeks. All right. All right. Be easy on yourself. No matter what it is that you have to offer, it will be accepted by those who have chosen your presence. However, again, let's turn this around a bit. For it will, again, give you this too, this ability to do this with you kind of any kind. You have told me very nicely, by the way. What it is that is negative about this idea of code, but what, using your old imagination? May you be positively getting out of having this code? I realize upon your planet, you usually will not in any way shape or form. Shall we say, relate the idea of discomfort to positiveness, but proceeding with the idea that everything has a positive possibility. What may that be within your situation? What has the code allowed you to find? To be patient. That is good. That was pretty easy. I have a few more. I need to. There are other things within me and I feel that need to be brought out of me and I can only do that alone. Maybe imagining or thinking or bringing up old police patterns that I created through my childhood or relationships in my past that may that have to bring up within myself and release so that my judgments of others won't be as harsh. Very whole. You do very often in your society, choose this idea for that reason. However, you do not have to. And simply that realization that you can, as you say, process these things, incorporate into great these things from your childhood. In a painless fashion. Very often you associate this idea of exploring your past. With the over town that it must be a tumultuous process. It must be a rushing process that will provide through this rushing some type of breakthrough. Yes, it may be that way. But that, as well as anything else, is simply a definition. It's simply one possibility of how you can choose to do it. But you do not have to. Are there, is there another thing which this code has allowed you to find or feel which has helped you to integrate your own consciousness? Frustration, I think that's right. Very good. And again, we labeled earlier in this interaction that frustration is simply a lack of trust. Again, you said, I quit my job and back then I had a lot of trust. There is no reason to not still have that trust. It works the same way. But the difference is when you get through what we have labeled that crossover period, you won't have so much seeming misery. You will have what we have labeled an ecstatic explosion of coincidence. Those who incidents is being. Things which occur at the same time. Incidences, code, coincidence, which will bring you everything in a continuous fashion with no interruptions that you have ever desired. When we present this idea to you, do you feel that it is, as you say, fairytale? No. Very good. You are on the way. Trust is all the things. You are on the way. And again, a lot of times in your society, when someone brings up the idea of trust or faith, you get what we had called a collective psychic groan. Oh, that's a real puppy. Now I got a trust. Now I got to have faith. And you have labeled that in lieu of the idea of faith or trust you have doubts. But understand again, a doubt is not a lack of trust. A doubt is an infinite trust. In fact, which you do not prefer, you are very glad that trusting does not take any effort to simply realize that everything you have manifested in your life is from what you have trusted in. If there are things in your life which you no longer prefer, then you can use the idea that we related to a positive synchronicity, starting out realizing that everything is there for a reason. And then simply allow those things which you no longer prefer to transform themselves, which they will, by taking this approach. What would a person have to believe in order to create this thing which I do not prefer? And upon answering that question, you will have fish out the belief that is limiting out holding you back from your desires. Many times simply the realization of a belief system that you are holding comes along with two portions. The idea of, ah, I do believe that indeed, and that is very dated. I no longer prefer that. And it is that simple to change. Simply the realization of fishing them out. So when you realize that everything does happen for a reason, anything which you may not prefer is a time, an opportunity, a red flag. Here is an opportunity to fish out a belief which no longer serves me, which if I change will bring me that much closer to this ecstatic explosion of coincidence. Do you understand? This is what we mean by glean the positive meaning from all. Very often when things are repetitively happening in your own life, whether it be that you don't have money or whatever, it is simply that you have not gotten the message. Symbols do not hang around when you get the message. However, when you refuse to get it, when you refuse to glean the message, it comes back again, a little bit ugly. It is a little bit stronger and simply because you normally continue to label these the same thing coming back again. By saying this is not the same thing, this is a neutral occurrence and I can label it whichever I want and it serves me best to realize that it may have a positive meaning. This approach will very quickly change your life. When it does, please come and share with us. Do you have another question? When you spoke earlier about when you come to a certain point when you're choosing to receive things from a positive standpoint rather than a negative standpoint. When you said that negativity tends to rear it back more so and not things. Only in a seeming fashion, only using those over labels of belief systems. Within the new positive belief systems, nothing is negative. Things may, you may have what you label a negative thought, but you do not manifest negativity by proceeding in action as though you feel it is negative. If a situation presents itself and you decide this is very bad, you act markedly different from if the same situation comes along and you say it is very good. It is that action that creates and perpetuates your reality. Therefore when we say attitude is everything, we mean it. That is what determines the tone, the atmosphere of your actions. Action being the step of creation and manifestation for your physical beings. Therefore in a physical world, action is what moves things along. So by simply changing the label, it may seem that for a moment you don't, your old costume, that they are very negative. However, they are simply giving you the opportunity to realize you can't relabel them. And by proceeding in action with the new label, you get a positive effect. Remember, what determines effect, experience, manifestation, being positive or negative is whether you proceed with positive or negative attitude while you are in action. Therefore simply a slight shift in your perspective can make a grand change in your reality. One of the ideas you may or may not be familiar with is the idea that from our perspective everything, everything, everything, no exceptions, no exceptions, everything is fundamentally neutral. Like zero, devoid of meaning, you assign the meaning and the meaning you assign, the tolerance, the effect you get. Do you understand that idea? Yes, I do. Does that answer your question? Yes. Very good. Do you have another question? Yes. Very good. Thank you very much for sharing with us this evening of your time. Shady. Hi. Mary. As you say, don't all talk and want to share. I know. Something that I... A while back. Do share. There was a question asked about when you stopped and said one moment, what you did. Yes. When you answered one was, were you talked about the effect of going and reading to your planet, to community, with it all been in? I think there was a spot or a place that you would go to. Yes, the primer. Could you give a little bit more on that? In a sense, briefly. Our planet, per se, has no, as you say, structures, upon us. We live in a very park-like environment, in terms of the natural, fauna and flow of our planet being relatively untampered with. In a sense, that all, what you may, although this is not an exact analogy, it will do, make the comparison of, or to see, that we have discussed earlier this evening of your time. And one of such an energy area upon our planet is, again, very park-like, no structures upon us. It is, in a sense, a space, a place of what we have called the limbo state, where there is no more momentum behind one idea or another. Therefore, by going there, you can very strongly and very easily feel, which we always do feel, but invariably, you can very strongly feel your connection with all that is. And in a sense, commune with all that is, you can also, because the energy of that area is so malleable. In a sense, what we translate, basically, to the idea of what you would call upon your planet, manifesting materiality from thin air. For there is equal potentiality in each bit of space within these areas. To, shall we say, be molded according to mentality. Does that answer the question? Oh, that's wonderful. Now, also, when we did talk about the idea of one moment, we were more specifically speaking of the idea of a computer aboard our scout craft from which we project in these interactions. There are also several other reasons that we have described over the idea of one moment, either accessing certain ideas in these subconscious of the channel, or as I recall earlier this evening, a scanning with which sometimes a yield, no information. That was a very powerful symbol. When that information was not available to us, for it allowed us to demonstrate to you that we do in a sense practice what we preach. If we do not know something, we trust a hundred percent entirely without a shadow of about. We don't need to know it at that time. Period. It is not an issue. We do not be ourselves off. Thank you very much. Well, that's awesome. You have put a short amount of time for a brief sharing or two shins. I think we both share a little bit of money. Is Mary present? Mary's in a meditative state. You all know the one I mean. And we ask you a question. You can't say no, you know. Yes, you can ask me. How have you been doing? I've been doing great. We are between the age of 8 years, tapping into our energies. We are having much fun. We are having much fun over here. You still desire to challenge? Yes. Out no bounds. Yes, ma'am, maybe. Mary. Very good. So see. You are doing very well. We are enjoying these interactions. These interactions are great with the island. At this time, move into my tune. As you say, officially invite you to partake of our energies at any time, in any way that you wish to, including the idea of this type of channel, whatever you desire. We would find much joy in that interaction. Oh, wait, if you do choose to do so, that interaction. Understanding that we have no expectations. And in whatever way that we do interact with you, we are having a lot of fun. Do you have a question? And before you say anything, we sense that you do. I'm going to charge you, to decide for whether or not. I'm going to repeat it. I'm going to take a question. A statement saying that I just have you so much fun. You are your energies. Thank you very much. Have you noticed, within these interactions, the difference in the breathing patterns of the physiological channel upon the introduction of our energy? Yes, and I'm discussing, well, also the sensation that Andrew and I were discussing of sensation through the small finger and the brain finger of both hands, mostly at digits, the right hand. That I've noticed this, that associated with breathing patterns at all? In a sense, more to the idea of the energy, as the channel has very well guessed, there is a lot more energy going in a sense, in a sense, than is coming out. Without interactions with Darryl, there was much animation of the limbs, animation of the trunk. At this point, for very specific reasons which we will not discuss at this time, Andrew has not allowed, shall we say, before it's flourishing of this energy. And this may cause some discomfort. Yes, the discomfort of which you do speak. However, back to the issue. Well, have you noticed a difference in these breathing patterns? For instance, when he does sit down and begin to breathe normally, do you then notice when that breathing does become very cavernous, very deep, very loud? Yes, this is the point of the link, as we call it, and by working with your breathing, you may use that as, shall we say, a guideline that you are having an effect. When that breathing does deepen, which incidentally is not intentional upon his thoughts, he does not normally breathe in such a fashion, however, when our energy is expressed through this particular physical vehicle, we utilize it in slightly different way than physiological child. For instance, we do utilize the cavities of the head, the cavities of, as you have called your sinuses, we do utilize the diaphragm and the lungs in terms of allowing the energies to come through. That is in a sense why we are much louder, and our breathing is much deeper. It is a different usage of the same material, but that is the distinguishing characteristic of the link. Again, that is not his normal breathing pattern, and you too can use this guideline or idea to experience the beginning stages of such a link. Thank you. Thank you very much. We are one last sharing. Yes, for sure. Yes. Uh-huh. Incidentally, we understand that welcome home is an order. Thank you very much. How could you, uh, suggest to answer to relax more while he is channeling? The reason we were not specific with these parameters are this is part of his discovery within this channeling, but at this we will tell you. As this energy becomes dispersed more throughout his body, well shall we say these interactions will take on a new life, a new enthusiasm, a new excitement, and he is not very far from this idea. Do not mean to be vague, but again we will not open his presence for any reason, and we are aware that he was consuming takes very carefully. Do you have all the money for new stuff? Thank you very much. Again, everything is new. If we seek the same sentence, it is a new for creation, is ever creating itself a new, paradoxically, and this becomes a bit sketchy within your idea of understanding. Everything already exists, and at the same time is being created anew. Whenever you run into what you have called the idea of paradox, you are scurvy or boring the idea of forced density. For, with a non-physicality and the last stages of physicality, paradox is indeed normality, naturality, but within your sense of focus. Whereby you have label that it must be this or that, can't be bold. Very often it is bold, as we have said, the ultimate truth is composed of all truths. Whether or not they are contradictory, therefore it is always this and that which one do you desire, not this or that you can only have one. It is all within your reach, all within your grasp, and as you do allow yourself to feel deserving, deserving of all the joy and ecstasy that you can muster up for any idea of joy and ecstasy that you can even imagine. You are capable of achieving. As you do this, again you come that much closer to me. And see whereby we can walk side by side where we can, as you say, walk in and sense each other's mark of sense. We look forward greatly to that day. We thank you very much for your swimming in the sea of the consciousness that we all are together with us, as well as with each other, except each other for what you are, except all others for what they are. You do not have to buy into their philosophy. You do not have to live their philosophy, however, if you wish to integrate yourself into one whole being instead of what you have, a collection of parts, simply learn to validate all. For the invalidation is the dividing walls of which you desire to break down. So remember, you do not have to agree, but you may wish to validate. If you have a thought which you do not prefer, do not invalidate. That is the same thing. Simply use this catch phrase. Well, I must contain. Otherwise, I wouldn't be experiencing. But I sure don't prefer. And therefore do not desire, not affect it. That way, rather than trying to push away these things, and there is no place to push them to in the totality of all that you are, by incorporating and validating them, in a sense you allow them to be on there many ways. Therefore, the scene for the week will be validation. We now beg you a bond and love it. Good night.
