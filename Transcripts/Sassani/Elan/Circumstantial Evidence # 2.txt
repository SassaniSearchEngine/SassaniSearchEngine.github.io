 I want to go back to husband. My is adopted your philosophy. Potted it anyway. And has invited me to participate, but as a non-person, as behind him, not alongside of him. In what life? He, my viewpoint, is unimportant, only his, uh, from whose perspective is his. Are you biting into that invalidation? And thereby creating that effect. Sometimes, yes, because, uh, he talks me in circles and I'm gonna hear you. Are you aware that you do not have to buy into that invalidation? And the only way, in effect, again, to create feeling invalidated is to buy into it. Nobody can inherently invalidate you. Only that you, in a sense, believe what they all say. Lately since I've been listening to the taste and involved myself, um, I've overcome that. But, um, he still talks me in circles. Can you, as you say, provide an example of this circular speech? Oh, God. Um, if I got an example here. When he wanted to go to Florida, and I said, maybe we shouldn't, we should fulfill our agreements here first. If we go, we should go with integrity, so to speak. You know, pay off some bills first. And he says, no, that's what excites us, then we should just go. And somehow those bills will get paid. And he's missing the point completely. Um, alright. And if the two of us cannot, if the two of us cannot be excited about something and only he is, then how can we work as a family? We have two kids. May I ask you a question? Did it excite you to go? Oh, yeah. Alright. It did excite both of you. Are you, in a sense, intending on meeting your agreements and obligations? Oh, yeah. They're not later. Alright. I am. I don't know what his intentions are. He doesn't talk to me about it. Alright. We perceive that they are the same. Intending on meeting those agreements. If you will grant yourself your excitement, you may find as that individual has pointed out, needs will be met. However, if you are, in a sense, anxious rather than excited, you may create quite a different reality for understanding that excitement and anxiety are sustained energy. One from a positive perspective, one from a negative. If you live through excitement, you will manifest the positive aspect. If you live through anxiety, you may manifest the negative. That anxiety in and of itself allows you again as all circumstances and opportunity to view what you still believe that you are fearful or anxious about this idea. Do you understand? Yes. Do you truly believe that the universe will provide you with what you need when you need it? Yeah. And remember and recognize yourself in owning your belief system in order to change it is to be honest with yourself in assessing it. For me, I believe that. But what about us as a family? Alright. For yourself is your main concern. Do you have positive intentions for your family? Yes. Alright. Why would you think that anything but your positive intentions would manifest? Because my husband gets in the way all the time. You are giving your power away in that sense. Do you recognize it? No, I guess I do. He is not responsible for you. You are not responsible for him. You can only be responsible to another individual by being who you are. Are you being who you are? No, not always. Alright. That may be a place as you say to begin again. I give in to him. I'm like, okay, just to avoid some conflict but then yet. Alright. It is in a way analogous to what we had discussed earlier with a budding of eggs between mother and child. Are you actually arguing in many of these instances about things you really agree about and simply wish to be the one to be expressing it? Oh, properly. Ah, many times we see this is a fact. What about your perception of the chauvinism? Will you allow it to change your actions to in a sense conform to that belief system? Oh, I tried. I told him point blank, Robbie, you are being a pig. He looks at me and laughs. May I ask you a question? How long does this angle fly? A long time ago. Are you aware of our definition of anger? Yes, I've heard it. Alright. Share it with me now. Okay. Okay. Alright. Does not have to be. Like I said, I'm not a very verbal person. Alright. It might not mean to present to you our definition of anger. And thank you for the opportunity. Anger is simply a rush of alignment, allowing you to see in but a moment's time where you stand on an issue. And last, 10 to 15 of your second only. Beyond that, it is judgment. If that's worked with my kid, I've done that with my kid. Alright, but recognize. You are saying you create anger, which is simply that he allows you to align yourself to where you stand, but you are then progressing to judgment, to separation, to determining what you do not prefer and invalidating what you do not prefer. Simply allow that again to be of service to you. How does this serve me? What is it allowing me to see? Ah, I now see I have this belief. Do I pre-flirt or to perpetuate that belief? Yes, I do. No, I don't. An opportunity to nail down and weigh your beliefs. Then you do not put up actually weight what you label, argument, trying to convince the other of a viewpoint, which again we have said, very often you do not totally believe yourself. So allow it to serve you just as we spoke of your fear serving you. Your anger also serves you simply when it spills over into judgment and validation. Recognize that and recognize. Allow it to center you back and do not then go on and in validational, war-pass. You may find your purposes are far more aligned than you are allowing yourself to see. Do you have another question? I can't. No, I do. All right. If you do, please share. You will not be interrupted and we appreciate the opportunity to interact about these ideas. If in a sense you need to review them, you may do so. Four, these interactions are available on what you label, type. And very often, a degree of the information will be absorbed and then upon re-listening more and more will be absorbed allowing you again to nail it down. If you can, however, be specific about what you are not still clear about, we may interact now. With the tapes, listen in to this. He thought that I was just getting too far with all of this and when I would bring it up, he took the tapes away from me. All right. Unlike his child, he took the tapes away. He keeps them in North Haven in his truck. I had to borrow this tape recorder just to take this session. All right. We'll allow this individual to be privy to also what we have shared. Giving him the opportunity to also censor and align from his perspective. He has all the power he needs to create his own reality without having to borrow some of your own. You all do. In a sense, my job is to put myself out of a job by allowing you to realize and recognize you do have all the power you need to create what you desire without harming yourself or others or forcing your viewpoint upon others. I do not need your power. I have enough of my own. Thank you very much. Therefore, you may also don that perspective and recognize again rather than allowing it to be why is this happening to me. Allow it to be how is this serving me? Do I prefer what it is allowing me to see? If so, I will continue. If not, thank you for the opportunity to realize I no longer wish to play. Do you understand? Yeah, but how do you just think it like that? How do you say I no longer wish to play, period? I mean, when there could be a potential danger to your child or something. All right. You are pondering a what if as opposed to a what is? If you do operate from that perspective creating the corresponding primary belief of fear, you will draw that reality to yourself. If you recognize again your deserved ability, proceed with your excitement with integrity, all the details will fall into place. And you may very well find that you have made an agreement with that individual for particular reason, you are not necessarily saying you need split, simply allow the relationship to be what it is and determine where your preference stands and only perpetuate that which you prefer in any given moment. Cannot discuss the how's and where for is now for it is not that moment that you have gone through what we are describing. At that point in time the parameters will differ. You will have different choices. Therefore, again, you will be functioning from what is not what if. Big distinction. All right. Again, if you have another specific question, feel free to share. Sharing. The shark. Yay. Female. Let it mail. I have an interesting situation to post to you. Oh, thank you very much. I'm divorced from my ex-husband. He's moving to New York. He's sold our house. I'm living here in Connecticut. He's home watching my child from another man. And I'm not even sure what the situation is. I know we still love each other, but he's moving to New York. I'm here and I just find the situation extremely interesting. They asked you a question. Sure. What excites you the most? Absolutely. All right. Keep on doing it. Allow it to deliver to you now that you have transformed the reality you have chosen to now own and allow it to bring with it what it will. In a sense, we perceive this as a positive transformation, allowing you to now live the life you have chosen. You can basically go forth and do and act and move with your excitement as your relationship has allowed you via positive, via negative ideas to define yourself still further. This is the most service any being can be to another being. In a sense, if you are physically in a sense relocating, it may be the timing in this instance to move on to new ideas, new relationships. Now again, recognizing that the primary relationship exists within you, feeling complete as you are and drawing whatever other individuals or paradoxically sometimes that same individual to now reflect back to you within the completeness that you already are. I have a few questions. Number one, you have told us that during these sessions, there are many beings, maybe some from your own home of Esasani and also maybe other civilizations that are observing what is going on here. Could you elaborate as to what their relationship is to you? Do they give you advice? Do they say nothing? What do you tell us about that? In a sense, you may view the idea as what you label upon your planet, a forum. And thereby, shall we say, I act as the direct diplomat and there is input, per se, from other ideas. That's so much the idea of advice but input. There are various shall we say strength, various shall we say propensities from various other individuals, various other collective ideas that when that is what is necessary, shall we say supply, provide, make available certain perspectives. Does that help? Yes. Is there sometimes disagreement as to what you're telling us versus their ideas? In a sense, in the way you mean it, no. Are there various perspectives from which to choose? Yes. Am I generally the one to choose them? Yes. There are exceptions. A word right now as to which civilizations are represented in this form. Not in a sense, collectively at this moment, if I have a need to tune into that idea, I can say. Thank you again. We function within total trust all the time and understand beyond the shadow of a doubt that we know what we need to know when we need to know it. In a sense, that does take the burden off of an individual to have to remember everything as you say under the sun. It is just there when we need it. This is how we function and this is how you can function. You have simply chosen to buy into your idea of memory. But in a sense, it is an illusion. Your brain in a sense, as we have discussed, is more of a filter than a receiver. And so that you can focus actually filters out. 99.9% of all reality. So you can maintain the focus you have chosen to explore. Therefore, you never actually remember something that you have stored in your memory. Simply allow yourself to open that filter up in such a way. Therefore, you have access yourself to all the collective information. And I simply understand that it is a filter and beginning to allow it to function a bit morelessly. Plugging in the belief that I will know what I need to know when I need to know it. Replacing the old belief of I can only know what I have learned. That is a belief. That is a definition. When you are taught in a sense very early on in your life, therefore have a high propensity to re-perpetuate, but no more than a definition. And you are amply able at this very moment to function in the way we are describing, knowing what you need to know when you need to know it. One of the guides or aids we have given you is the concept that experientially the present is not a result of the past. That is a seining continuity that you create, and by believing it you create the effect of it. Therefore, creating the effect that the present results from the past, therefore I must have in the past, have done what I will now need in the present, is the mechanism by which you create that limitation. But in these sessions you seem to deal with our questions with some dudes and don'ts as to what you are allowed to tell us and reveal with us or not. Thank you very much. We are privy, shall we say, to the separation that you have colloquially made, the information from your higher self, which allows us when we are allowed. Do you access it within perfect timing? To know some of shall we say your overall purposes? You have created within this existence timing, which by definition you reveal things to yourself over a continuum of time. Therefore you do it to explore and experience certain ideas. And when our accessing that information will, shall we say, impose or interfere with what you have chosen to explore, we choose to remove that from our awareness. In a sense, since we create less limitation than your society than you, one of the limitations we have chosen to in a sense impose upon our self is this idea. Now interfering with the growth of any particular consciousness and removing this a bit further any particular society. Therefore, we will not interact with your society face to face until you invite us as a collective. That is why we are communicating one of the reasons in this fashion to still allow you to decide to not impose upon what you have chosen to create. That is not our focus. So in a sense, that is one of our self-imposed limitations. Does that answer the question? Yes, thank you for that explanation. Thank you, number two. Twist the veil of the second area. Are you now in your scalp, craft as usual? Yes. With one mind of exception. I am not at this timing in orbit around my planet. Shall we say without being too specific, I am in the neighborhood. Thank you, guys. We think so. You have indicated that the inhabitants of Esophani generally are not on the planet but are in space crafts of one side or another and that your mother ships can be as big as maybe one mile in... Or large in dimension or even maybe up to ten miles. Eight. Which is many, many thousands of people are in there. I guess what I am asking is to do a library as to what are all those people doing in a spaceship and yet at the same time exploring other civilizations? Is that what they are up to? Thank you very much. That is the idea. One of the focuses of our civilization is to explore the many diverse ways in which infinite creation is truly to experience itself. How many more ways that consciousness is choosing to explore consciousness? Therefore, that is one of the primary focuses of our exploration and we are involved with many civilizations. There are, however, generally a portion of our population upon our planet but people come and go and in fact a portion of our population as you say would be described best as transience. People popping in and out. People from various other civilizations coming to visit in various forms. Does that help? Yes, the follow up if you will. Alright. Your being in the neighborhood, does that permit you to somehow observe or do things that otherwise you wouldn't do back near as this thought? In a sense, there are various reasons for this which we cannot at this time discuss but shall we say in an entirely unobtrusive way we are choosing to observe in a more direct fashion through the great excitement being created upon your planet at this time. What does that mean more direct about you? What does that mean more direct fashion? Shall we say from time to time direct visual observation again in an unobtrusive way? Does that answer the question? Are you trying to get a more face to face exchange with what's going on in the golf area? In a sense, you may say that is one of the purposes but not really face to face. You will not see us upon your news program at least not at this time. Eventually, however, that will be available if you desire for recognize your planet has been visited throughout the entire history of your mankind by extraterrestrials. And obviously, one may assume if you wish that we have chosen for specific reasons to be non-interfeiting. Otherwise, you would know about us in a more direct way. In a sense, we are waiting for your transformation to take place to the point that we are invited on mass. And we will come and we look forward to such a day if you should choose the creative. Thank you very, very much. Share it. Hey, female, then over there. Question, what is the difference between a dimension and a continuum and how many content and continuum do we have? The idea that you label a continuum, essentially colloquially speaking, is the idea of time, linear time. Dimensions, however, may or may not manifest the idea of timing. At an sense, timing you may say is within a particular density or dimension, beyond which it does no longer, in a sense, experience itself in quite that way. The idea of moving from one density to another becomes the realization that you are the density or dimension that you once thought you existed within. Does that help? Yes. What? Do universities exist within universities? Yes, very literally, and as you have even said, universities within grains of sand. For the idea of size, the idea of space is quite arbitrary. And space in a sense, if you wish to look at it that way, overlaps itself. You are recreating yourself. One moment. In the neighborhood, for a figure within your terms of counting, at approximately 63 million times per second, well, you may view in this way that in between each of those recreations is somebody else's reality. Your off time, colloquially speaking, very colloquially speaking, is the on time for another reality, which I mentioned. So they do literally exist within each other and overlapping each other. Does that help? Yes. A couple more questions. All right. I've been having a feeling that there were more planets than the ones we know about, and I've also been having a feeling that each planet actually represents an energy and time warps and I'm not sure, and can you tell me what the, how the stars may represent us in some way? Thank you. The idea that you refer to as planet, shall we say you have discovered those ideas. There may be additional what you would label, satellites, but they are not quite within what you consider to be the consistent orbits of what you see. Therefore, again, some of your scientists are beginning to classify moons of some of your planet as minor planets, and certain of the larger, shall we say, debris or asteroids within what you labeled your asteroid belt as a type of minor planet. But in the way in which you mean, shall we say a planet beyond your idea of Pluto that is within the same style of orbit? No. The idea of stars determining your destiny in a sense can be viewed this way. They are simply patterns of energy representing some of the overall agreements you have made, but in no way shape or form, shape your destiny or control it at all. Therefore, in a sense, they are, you may say, a map of the choices of the agreement of the ideas you are exploring if you view them that way. Look at that. I'm going to shoot a bird. Ask a question. If I look at the historic night, somehow I think I'm that energy. All right. And you may say, is it that way? But what is, never mind, I won't even ask that question. Oh, I don't be shy. No, no, I was just going to say, well, what's the term? What is your perception of a human being connected to a star? Very often. One more. The way that you create the idea of lineage, the idea of path-wise, the idea of other dimensions of experience by your same overall consciousness, will, within particular timings for particular purposes, reflect back upon your lineage prior to your human incarnation. And very often, what you are speaking of is simply a drawing of your attention to what may be, in some cases, the star system in which you have it colloquially speaking, come. Does that seem to be what you are experiencing? Yes. Very good. Thank you. Thank you very much. Over there. Yes. Yes. No. All right. Could you show me how you choose an individual's channel through? Thank you. There are ideas of overall agreements that are made colloquially speaking in what you would call between lives with energy that are similar in nature, able to act and desire us of acting in service in that life, which is the instance before him. This individual has made an agreement which he made, decide to fulfill or not wish to fulfill at any time, and we understand, because again, everything is perfect timing, that any individual upon this planet, within any timing, will allow us to, in a sense, do our job most effectively. Does that help? Thank you very much. Good night. I have a question referring to the last week's session. All right. Follow up questions. Yeah. Trevor was talking about teleporting. Yes. And you, and you explained to him the symbol A, the ethics of it, the feeling or emotions? Well, in a sense. In a sense. Can you read the font? Can you define that just a little bit more? Yes. The idea of being what allows a consciousness to first begin to embark upon this idea of is the realization that you do not exist within space, within time, that space and time are a property of you, therefore, and hence, part of your vibration. When you are standing in position A, you are the signature vibration that you are with a positional vibration of position A. When you move to position B, you have pretty much the same overall signature vibration with a slight variance to correspond to the differing time, space, coordinates. Therefore, one makes around themselves through their consciousness with what we have labeled and what we do within our spacecraft and isolation field, allowing one to maintain their overall signature vibration, but isolates them from the aspect or portion of their vibration corresponding to space, time. That individual is curious then about how to set the coordinates and go once in the isolated situation and the way it's as follows, rather than having these specific, the frequencies, each little detail and having to plug them into an overall machine as we do, as is available, you may in a sense cut through this process through consciousness and the way being, locking yourself into the coordinates simply by visualizing the place you wish to go, and then, and here's the key, using your E motion, E motion, energy motion as the activating mechanism to then thrust you through, in a sense, the door or gateway you have created. Therefore, picturing the place you wish to go after surrounding yourself with a grey scene as a representation of an isolation field and then, as deeply, as intensely as you possibly can muster, plugging in how that location, now that you are visualizing it, allows you to feel and that emotion, if you have already viewed the other beliefs about put in some of the ideas that you're not going to see, and that you're not going to see how far you've been. So, why do you think this whole idea is? Will propel you immediately to location V? Does that explain the idea? Oh, that's terrific. Thank you very much, and it is that simple. Your willingness to believe that it is that simple allows you to gauge how close you are to how absurd allows you to see how far from this idea you are. That is all. It is that simple. But, again, there are some issues with what you regard and label within your society, your sanity, that may be viewed and observed before you will allow yourself to quote, break from the reality you are used to. You are not used to individuals popping in and out. Therefore, there is that whole sub-issue with which you may look at, the tournament, as we have said, what is your primary belief? Validate that you do have that primary belief. Word. Praise the new belief that you prefer to have. View the equality between the two beliefs. They are absolutely equal, no more way to each or anyone. Praise words. Say out loud the new belief with feelings as you would feel in order to really believe that, again, emotion, energy, motion, the activating mechanism. And then, again, we always say here is the key. Act that way. Those are the simple steps to changing any belief. If you do not admit, however, to yourself, that you have that belief, you cannot begin or perpetuate the process. It is the beginning step. Being honest with yourself and allowing anything that occurs to cue you into what beliefs you do have and admitting that you have them. Very often individuals will not admit they have certain beliefs, and as we have said, you cannot change what you do not own. Therefore, again, the beginning step, what do you believe? Be honest. What you will very often find is when you are honest with a belief you are perpetuating, that resulting creating what you do not prefer is. Ah, I do have that belief. Very interesting. Also, it seems most outdated. I do not need to have that belief anymore. By admitting you have it, you have validated it. That allows you to equalize it with a belief you prefer to have by invalidating anything. You do not give it less weight. You give it more weight. In order to choose between beliefs you must equalize them so that you have equal choice. Does that help? Yeah, I just have one other thing to say. There will be a few moments left in this interaction. No, okay, never mind. I'll ask you. I'm not funny. Does the population only create a bike into positive experiences? Yes, only ever experiences positive effects. Do you get bored? No, never. I'm always doing what excites us. I'm always led to the next thing that excites us. I'm always feeling 100% support by the universe. All realizing that there is unity in diversity and you never lose your individuality. So there is no unhappiness in the negative? None whatsoever. And you can experience this too. Perhaps one of the reasons locking you into not experiencing it is thinking it's what people want. It is an Hire to me, actually. Hold on. That is your definition. Continue to have it if you wish. If you choose a never ending ecstatic life of complete ecstasy and fulfillment you may wish to change it. Hold on. Start. Start. One moment. We have time for about three more sharing. One, two, three. Proceed. Sorry, you mentioned that this is your job. Yes, innocence. We do not have jobs per se as you describe them. It is my interest, my hobby, my propensity. I also am a pilot. This aspect of my job, you may label, hate sociological, and you need it in a way. And I am also interested in what you label, sculpture, art work, music, proceed. Have you heard of the inner circle? We are familiar with the idea of the energy of which you speak, but not necessarily by that moment collection. Is there a hierarchy that governs in some way where you go and who goes where and what kind of help, what kind of. Only if you created that way. From the idea of the association of worlds of which we speak, one might consider it a hierarchy, but within the hierarchy there is no hierarchy. In a sense it is more organizational than governmental. You understand? Yes. Thank you very much. Shind. Shind. Yes. I was wondering about past life. Oh, right. What do you want? I'm wondering how come I have so many and how I relate much more with some than with others than others. Thank you very much. You have been exploring for 25,000 of the older years this type of limitations. You have played it all. You have been victim. You have been perpetuated. You have explored every aspect of limitation feeling cut off from the infinite and now beginning to recognize you never loved. Different path lies will have different varying relative significance to this life. Simply if you become in any given moment aware of a path life, it is most relevant to that moment. We need to promise what you will, but we have always said and maintained this idea. You have everything you need to proceed within this life now. Therefore, it can be very nice to reflect. It can be very nice to feel the various connections you have created, but it is all here now in order to proceed. Particularly now that we have delineated the idea of balancing your energy in less than a retribution style karma. Though many individuals use that as shall we say colloquially speaking and excuse to continue to create misery. That is the question. Thank you very much. No, female. Yes, the sorry. My question was, well, kind of as a whole we are becoming more aware of our earth consciousness. Very exciting. And this is why we can communicate with you. And also, you know, we are becoming more environmentally aware. My question is, are there a effect of the bombing that we can't measure that is going on right now? Is that wonderful for us? Yes, but understand, your planet is a sentient being. As consciousness in what you would label a self-reflective way. It loves you very, very much. It loves you so unconditionally much. It is willing in a sense to absorb, to some degree, much of this idea. Not that you would be able to continue along these lines, but it is sensing that you will no longer find it necessary. And your sense is acting as a shock absorber. Does that answer the question? Yes, I also wonder if there are any other things that are harmful to your planet, that we are not aware of. But jazz? Anything to the atmosphere. I'm just wondering if there is something else. Shall we say there are no hidden threats? But what you label many of the irreversible disasters upon your planet, for instance, the depletion of what you label your ozone, are not very well understood by your scientist. For the earth, in and of itself, has the ability to replenish its ozone and your scientists are becoming, and will be becoming more and more aware that it is so. Although from their perspective, they may choose to create the idea that they don't understand why it is happening. The earth is in a sense so appealing, but by. Shall we say, slowing down that process of healing is allowing you, as a society, as part of the overall earth that you are, to view many issues and make many decisions. And we perceive the earth in a sense that we are and will be dealing with that individuals are making the decision to, again, recognize their responsibility in a sense to the overall mother that sustains you. And therefore we see a positive trend within your society along these lines. And you can see the reflections of it within your society if you choose to look at that evidence. Look at that out. Understand again the idea. Create your evidence. If you are positively audiences, you will only see positive evidence. Anything that you may interpret as negative, you will simply review from your new perspective, thereby validating the primary belief and not being dictated to from the background of beliefs. As you utilize perception in this way, filtering them through your primary belief, you will actually see physical changes. You will actually see new evidence. The echo will catch up to the new original sound, and it is that simple. Simply allow yourself to now become aware of the new echo, for it is there. Evidence is all circumstantial, and that may be if you wish your entitlement for this interaction, circumstantial evidence, for that's all it is, a neutral set of trust. Grant yourself. Grant yourself. The worthiness. The validity to know that you deserve a world of peace. If you believe and intend upon having a world of peace, you will begin with yourself, with your primary belief, to act as an individual who believes in peace. We suggest, although you create many diversities, that an individual who believes in peace does not fight, in a sense, for peace. You do not get peace by hating war. You get peace by loving peace, and being willing to sustain yourself as a peaceful, positive reflection. You cannot, in a sense, walk over there and stop the war. You can, however, stop warring with yourself. Anything in your external reality is simply a reflection of an aspect of your internal reality. You cannot, in a sense, affect that external reality without first changing the internal reality. Life is not if you choose to realize this happening to you. It is happening from you, always. Simply choose what you prefer, and act like a being who will only accept what you prefer. In a sense, again, you perpetuate peace by allowing yourself within your mind, within your consciousness to achieve peace, to take anything that you do perceive as warring on fighting, and allow inner negotiation. Allow yourself to bubble to the surface those things you have chosen to hide from yourself because you have felt you cannot handle them. They are bigger than you. No. Nothing that you create is too big or too great for you to handle, and that recognition will now allow you, bit by bit, piece by piece, to integrate those things you have chosen to separate and hide away in the closet that you do label your subconscious mind. It is only a label. It does not empirically exist beyond your willingness to put that you are in it. And you can use any given circumstance, any, your fearful ones, your angry ones, your positive ones to determine what you still believe that is not serving you. In order to live a life of constant ecstasy, you must be willing to determine what you still believe that prevents your ecstasy. Exicy is not the exception. It is the rule. You are made of ecstasy. It is the only way you could hold together. It is the glue of infinite creation. You are all packets of ecstasy. Therefore, you are actually preventing, perpetuating what you do not prefer. You are holding yourself from ecstasy. Therefore, relax. Let go. Enable yourself in any given situation that you label negative to relax. Release how you are feeling. Take a few breaths. Remember what it is you wish to do. Reflect upon your purpose. Respond in action. Real eyes, your reality. Allow it to become real and rejoice. Fourth, you are ecstasy itself. And by allowing, not forcing, not making, that is not how the universe delivers and flows. By allowing yourself these recognition and granting yourself the right to remain happy, you may create that reality at any given moment. We thank you for allowing us to reflect to you these ideas. For recognizing that we would not be able to do so unless you already contain them. You must contain within your primary belief some ability to perceive what I am saying or you would not be here. If something I say sounds good, it's because you contain it. Simply grant yourself that recognition that you do contain it or you would not hear it. My mouth would be moving, but you would not hear any words coming out. Therefore we thank you again for your willingness to open up to yourself and suggest when you are willing to again receive your validation, receive your circumstantial evidence from your primary belief. You will allow the background to change. We bid you the most fond and loving. Good evening.
