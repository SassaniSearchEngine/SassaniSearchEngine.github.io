 Alright, I'll say continue sharing. Hey, smile, then to mail. I'd like to clarify something about the meaning of the exercise at the beginning of the session. Do proceed. If I understand correctly, it seems that the creation of excitement leaves us to be able to imagine activities we might be doing when we were excited. That is one way to approach it. The idea is in feeling excitement and the vibration of excitement. You will attract to yourself the resources through which to express that excitement. Do continue. And if we then allow ourselves to gravitate towards those resources or activities. Well also do understand it was body posture, orientation, approach and attitude, which is not something you need gravitate toward is simply something you can now that you've seen it. Essentially, perhaps at first it may seem as though you mimic it. But it truly is simply being it. Allowing yourself to derive the inspiration using your excitement, which is something that moves you, gives you passion as a tool of alignment. But once the image is there, once you see yourself by simply then mimicking that body posture, mimicking that attitude, mimicking and doing those things again to whatever degree they are available, you can already be that person. And in fact even picturing you are that person at that moment. So it is simply a matter of continuing to be that person. And am I correct in understanding that that then essentially leads us just, leads us back into the joy or ecstasy of being that person. That that would in a sense be the object of that exercise. It might remotely. Perhaps the object is to simply see which things you can be doing. That would allow you to express your joy. When actually beginning to walk, to move, to act, to put out in your physical world through action, you then create a new set of results. And this is one of the things, one of the most compelling pieces of evidence that you use, but not the only, that allows you to see the change in very blatant experiential terms. Is that clear? I think so. I'm left with the impression that the joy itself must in itself be an end. It must be an end in itself in us in doing this. Must be one of the reasons or a reason that we would undertake to do this in the first place. That that joy and that excitement, that this sheer expression of it would be in a sense part of the purpose or the purpose of it. Perhaps that is one way to put it. Another way to put it is that you begin to allow yourself without resistance to act naturally, which results in the idea of feeling comfortable, confident in that sense, motivated, self-assured, again productive and many of these other qualities, which you say you desire. Are we getting there? I think so. If not, please ask. This is as I have shared before of assistance to all, including myself, to clarify these points to focus your attention within these points. Well, in the sense that we say that we want to be motivated to be relaxed, to be confident, to be productive, if in fact those are our preferences, stated preferences, then this seems to be just describing for lack of a better word, a path to those preferences, a way to actualize those preferences. A, way, yes, not the only way, but a way to synchronize yourself and align to your natural self and express yourself purposefully and fully, simply because again, that is the most natural thing to do, an automatic by-product of doing this and getting the results is what you call contentment. One might perhaps argue that the contentment does come first. Well, that might be a chicken or the egg. I do have one other question about, I seem to have a kind of a reflexive reflex of, being aware of someone else's viewpoint or lifestyle or express point of view and almost instantaneously invalidating. And I have to continually bring myself back from that and try to find a way to appreciate it and yet not invalidate it. It's not a matter, it's not a process of invalidating my own perception or simply denying it or simply withholding. Understood. Do understand, foundationally, that when you invalidate any approach, you invalidate yourself on some level. And so your willingness to simply continue to validate yourself and that motivation can drive you to maintain focus, maintain alignment with again your positive self, which I assume built into the definition of who you are is the ability to allow others to express themselves in whatever way they wish and not necessarily condone it, but at least understanding and here's the key to validation that it has the right and its own specific reason to exist. So perhaps you can use that as an assistive approach. Well, all right, that is not something I would do. Therefore, you are not condoning it because you would not do it yourself. However, I can conjure up in my imagination that they definitely have the right to be whoever they are and that they must have some reason or set of reasoning to be exploring what they are. That allows you to honor their sovereignty and at the same time gather more information about yourself and understanding that you define yourself in seeing examples of who you are, but just as much define yourself in seeing examples of who you are not. So you can use it and if your initial reaction is of invalidation, you can use that as well. But it is simply a matter of reminding yourself, all right, my tendency is not to do that, but I can understand that they do have their own right and reason. Does that make sense? Is that something that you would find more simplistic to hinge upon? Yes, and I would expect it over time that would become more habitual, more automatic. Even just entertaining it, you will find immediately you will get a result that will feel natural. Still allows you to express your initial reaction, but not necessarily respond with an action statement or perspective until you realign. Until you remind yourself that's a valid exploration, not my choice, not who I wish to be, but a valid exploration and conversely as I had mentioned before, when you validate it, regardless of whether you condone it or not, you validate that much more of yourself. That seems to be consistent with my experience. So there can be, if you wish to have a motivation, the motivation. I wish to completely express myself and completely validate myself and allow all reflections to deliver a message, allow all reflections to reinforce, even if initially one of those reflections is my tendency to judge, which simply allows me to remind myself that I am not validating their right and reason and perhaps placing conditions upon the relationship as opposed to being unconditionally loving. Does that help or does it still hang up for you? And by all means, if it does, do share. No, I wouldn't do it hang up. I'd say that it's very pleasing to consciously. All right. That would be a start, something that is most pleasing. Obviously, you are in accord or alignment with that idea. So begin with that energy. That energy will replace, not get rid of, but replace a tendency to invalidate. Being pleased at the result of being willing to validate and again, still marking, still using that information to define yourself. Everything is useful, particularly with the being who is consciously allowing the reality to reflect back to them. And therefore, most literally, any other person that you perhaps formally would have a tendency to judge can actually be seen to be of service to you. And in some ways, maybe even ironically, more so than someone who is in complete agreement with you. As you move along, you will notice that. That's very much consistent with my experience. That in the instances when there is a transformation in my reaction that those people become maybe not necessarily some useful, but certainly valuable value, I would say. All right. May I make one other suggestion? Are you sure? Yes. All right. So, perhaps one place to start, to simply be pragmatic, to simply be applicable, is to be willing to start with yourself. In other words, look at the idea of no longer judging yourself for judging, judging yourself for invalidating. If you have a response that you would have judged within yourself, have it. If you hold it back, it will seem to be there and play out over a long period of time. If you have it, it's over. Now what? And the now what is you align. You align. You glean. You plug in. You use the feedback. That is when you can validate. That is when you can define yourself and so forth. But step one would be to allow yourself to have any reaction. Or as you have said, if you artificially squelch it, you will not be expressing yourself more fully. All right. All right. I think in some instances I am already doing this and maybe not noticing it as much as I might. Well as you begin to do things most naturally, you do indeed notice them less. Only things that stand out will represent differences or friction many times. This is true for people when they say, I perceive energy and now I no longer perceive it. What has happened? Am I no longer as able to tune in on it? Am I no longer as sensitive? No. You're now matching the vibration of that energy. What you feel as energy is the difference in your understanding of an energy and your understanding of where you are at. When you match an energy, there's no longer a difference and so it is not necessarily that noticeable. Therefore no longer feeling the energy standing out in relief is your indication that you are now matching that very energy. All right. Yes. I thank you. Thank you. Thank you. When we were doing greetings for us. And who you good day? When we were doing the exercise, I could feel the excitement and I bought the vision and it was beautiful and everything. And then right before you had said to kind of keep the excitement, I started to feel fast. That is because you had an assumption. That is that your assumption on some level was that what you experience had come from us leading an exercise rather than yourself. And along with that comes the idea, the exercise is over. But the surprise, the joy is that that is just the beginning and it illustrates not my ability to lead an interesting and expensive exercise. It expresses your ability to easily tap into who you are. Now when you begin to trust that, you will not feel as though it is something you can lose. That would be simply a choice to trust it. Allow me to ask you, what is it that you saw yourself doing when you felt excited? I was channeling. All right. What was the unexpected thing you noticed? All the people. All right. Very creative. What was your reaction to the unexpected thing? I actually felt more excited. All right. Allow yourself to understand that that is who you are. That feeling tells you that all you need to do to experience yourself as that person is those things. Now other than sitting in a chair and channeling, again, you can also see how you were holding yourself, how whatever you were channeling was interacting. These are all examples. People can witness these interactions and say, oh, this person channeling does this, or they can say, look at how a person, any person can interact with other people. Look at how they can treat everyone with complete respect. Look at how they honor everyone's question as being just as important as everyone else. And so on and so forth. All the qualities that you notice of these interactions, you can only notice because you contain it as well. Because you contain the ability to express it as well. And because you see what apparently is another human being, channeling my energy, but yet saying things that you can all say, it is a living example of what is available to you right now. And so beginning to understand that it is coming from you, you will begin to truly experience this. And if you feel the sadness, simply remind yourself that you are making an assumption, an assumption that you can lose something that you never can. And that reminder can realign you. How do you feel now? Better, thank you. All right. Thank yourself, what's the point? Yes. All right. Can I ask one more question? You just did. Would you like another? No, I'm going to learn not to say that next time. If you say, I will not judge you for it. Simply point it out. I was at the beach this week. And what kept coming into my reality was people that were missing limbs and stuff. And I just couldn't. I don't know. It started with my five-year-old saw this man and she said, Mommy, look, he's missing half an arm. And she says, well, how did he do that? I said, well, I really don't know. Well, ironically, he was in the back cottage so she went over and asked. And then I went to visit somebody and she was missing a half a leg. And then another friend came in and told me about somebody that got their arm cut off. And I'm like, boy, this is too much of my reality. But I didn't quite see this. Did you see this as you say as a right downer? Or did you see this as witnessing other individuals' persistence, commitment, willingness to express themselves no matter what? It simply depends how you choose to approach the symbol. I didn't feel bad, and I did kind of neutralize it because I was kind of concerned. Did you notice that they were able to go about their business? Yeah. Did they seem noticeably inconvenienced by what you would consider in your way of interpreting things to be a handicap? Did I perceive them having a handicap? Did you perceive that they were noticeably less able to get about and do their thing? I thought they were going to do it. Oh, right. But did you notice that they were still doing something? Oh, yeah. They were still doing something. So it depends how you choose to interpret the symbol. You can see it as a symbol of good thing it isn't me, or you can see it as a symbol of look at how they still are willing to express themselves. I can do that. Actually, I thought he was pretty cool about it, the guy with the one arm. It's the way that he explained it to my daughter, he was like, no problem. It was like the two of them were so natural about it. So perhaps in that sense, it was more your interpretation than even the own individual's interpretation of it being a symbol of helplessness rather than simply a situation that they have transformed. Again, as you attract yourself to these things, understand they are neutral symbols, and you can glean what it is you wish. If you wish to glean inspiration out of that, it will be quite simple simply by even thinking to do so. Well, look at what they can still do. It is inspirational in that sense. Nothing will hold what you call a person back except their own attitude or their own focus if you will. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Mail to the side. All right. I'd like a little, I've been getting some perspective lately on the idea of a suit of perspective is actually the idea of why we put ourselves into the illusion that we are separate from our source. All right. One. Reason would be what? That we can play with duality when we don't understand. In other words, if we know everything about it, then there's no game to play, no offense. What would you call one of the more exciting aspects of the game? Discovery. All right. If you already know it all, you can't discover. You can't learn. You can't experience the joy of the surprise. Is that not a good enough reason enough? All right. What else? The second one is the idea of the fact that we have some of us have put ourselves into the kind of a slumber state here so that we can awaken at a certain time when the energy is a little more focused. Perhaps you can say that is one game that you play as well, but since it will all be contingent on your own focus as to what you perceive happening to the math, it is far more individual than people are imagining it may be. And you can shift at any given moment, though that is the mechanism of being able to discover things and experience them as if anew, as for the first time. The what you call slumber, or perhaps you can say self-imposed forgetfulness of 99.999% of who you are. Do you know number three? Yes. The perspective of the fact that a lot of us have gotten together and made plans for now to put ourselves into the slumber so that we can all come out. Oh, right. Number four. Ah. Number four, from my perspective, is perhaps in many ways the most significant reason in many ways. Are you ready? Because it's there. Because it is available as an experience and consciousness can assume that experience, which is by the way literally the mechanism, there are many assumptions in place to create the solution because it's there. Consciousness is very versatile, very far reaching. Does not truly have corners, but within its totality and infinity can create the idea of spaces, masses, weights, time. And so therefore as one option in which consciousness can express itself, that in and of itself is a reason. Does that make sense? All right. Thank you for sharing that one. Oh, you've done all the sharing. Thank you. Shitty. Hey. On that same point you say because it's there, don't we create it to be there? The idea is that it is available as an experience. Yes, you do create it. But because you can create it, you do. In a sense it is reminiscent of a saying that you have. Anything that creation does not forbid it demands. Does that answer your question? It's a computer. How excited. You are simply redefining. Where does the confusion lie? What you said. Which part? If it's not there, we're trying to be creative. Is that because we? Anything that can be created, that you can imagine that can exist, will. Perhaps that's another way to put it. Perhaps that's the more positive way to state it. That is the nature of infinity. And as an interesting little side note, aspects of infinity being expressed through finite means. Now this may get confusing, so is there something else? I can understand that. Infinity you have no problem with. Apparently you are bigger than you thought. What this little guy here just can't see infinity, yes. If you say so. Well I'm in this body and it holds me back. You're in this body, very interesting. From my perspective, your body exists within your consciousness. Feel free at any given time to shift your focus to that understanding. Then you will have a different experience. You will not be a prisoner within a vessel. You will be a consciousness expressing a body understanding that when the consciousness shifts, so much the body by definition. Gives you a lot more leeway to remind yourself to look at it that way. And you understand because in infinity everything has a place, both are true. And it is more a matter of choosing than saying this is true or that is true. They are both true, which will you focus on and get the effect of? Sit on, I like to share a dream. All right. They always like craziest dreams. The craziest dream I doubt. Do proceed. So far. All right. The dream was that there was a spell of moving some furniture and stuff. And I was going to have to tell him, look at T-shirt and do it this my way. And he didn't listen. He ain't going to do it his own way. And by gosh, he just moved this huge rug. And it just moved right up on this truck. And on top of the rug was a sofa. And I couldn't imagine how the hell he did that. And then I realized the inside is a dream was. I just sat back and let him do it. He didn't have to do it my way. I can allow people to feed themselves to miracles and it was fine. Oh, what? That I didn't ask for control. That was my big thing. Well, perhaps the other lesson, if you wish to call it such, is the idea that when you allow others to do it their way, you can learn. And so as you have a desire to teach, to guide, to be an inspiration, to provide instruction in direction, also by being willing to allow people in that sense to walk upon their own two feet, you can learn from the other side of the interaction. Something like you're doing. In a sense, yeah. So, it was, when I do this, but I have these dreams and the inside comes to me when I can learn from it all that. How did I set that up? The idea is that you allow yourself in more literal terms to explore things that you are very obviously exploring in what you call your waking state. And again, perhaps the lesson that you are providing for yourself here is that your willingness to listen is just as assisting as your willingness in that sense to speak and to put out. And that even if you have a way to do it in watching someone else do it their way, either you will reinforce, ah, my way is more efficient or ah, now I am open enough to see there is actually a more efficient way than my way. And so this does not mean by any means that we would suggest that you squelch who you are, but in just as much as you would like someone else to listen and perceive who you are, what will make that more likely is your willingness to receive, your willingness to open up, and your willingness to allow someone else's approach and opinion to be equal to your own, even if it is not again the one that resonates with who you are. Really can you learn by your willingness to allow as opposed to dominating and forcing. So this is a valuable lesson to simply open up, trust that those around you also have their own competent facilities. What I meant was that setting up this dream in the, in the parable that it came, did I create that myself? Is this not obvious? Why do you ask this? Is that not obvious? Have you not said so? Perhaps I can ask another question. Who else would it be setting it up? I set it up myself, but is that another aspect of who I am? In other words, I'm looking at different consciousness. Do I have a higher consciousness? If you break yourself up into bits, pieces, and gradients, you can experience that appearance. But literally, you are one hundred percent complete consciousness that can express itself in fragments, but by all means can be privy to the whole because it is not something you are ever separated from with anything other than the assumption that you are. And so therefore, literally, yes, it was you. Of course it was you, and you know that. Wow, it's open somebody would come in and help. Why? Why? Yes, would you not find it more fulfilling and convenient to have your own facility? By all means sharing them with other individuals, but not relying on something outside of yourself, which is another way of stating you feel incomplete in and of yourself. By all means you can attract external reflection, but even if you do, it's you. Everything that you gain from interacting with me is truly from your end you interacting with yourself. If you say you understand, you are accepting what you are saying, but it is still you. And so you can argue a lot and you've helped me, or you can understand I've used you as a convenient reflection. Thank you for being the mirror. It's up to you. If you think you need help, again, that denotes coming from a place where you are not self-complete. You know, I think it comes back from my upbringing and religion. You are creating yourself completely 100% right now. You can use any criteria to rationalize why you are focusing yourself as this being. So yes, you can create the transparency that the past has something to do with the present, but the present is not truly a result of the past experientially. You recreate it using it as evidence, using it as reinforcement. So if you wish to continue to delve back into something which has already played out and attempt to explain who you are now, you can create the transparency of that process, but it takes a long time. You asked me why did I teach someone else? Then I gleaned your answer and made a suggestion. I see now where I have to create someone else helping me, it's my guiding angel, or my lord or whatever. Well by all means do it, but understand ultimately it will be a shell game you are playing with your own consciousness. You will be the one who hears some advice, no matter what the external source of help is, and only will you experience the effects of it when you do it. So the advice is simply a suggestion, the help is simply a suggestion. You are ultimately the one who will focus in on an approach, express that approach and create the effect in your life. So if you wish to have someone come save you, you can create that transparency, but ultimately in the state of allowing yourself to gain all the knowledge you realize, ah, it was me all along. So you can do it whatever way you want. When I decided to take on this body in my consciousness, did I also decide on what I was going to experience? Not necessarily literal circumstance, overall themes are generally what you will choose to focus on. There is always the variability of shifting your focus however, once you actually incarnate. So it is very loose, but for instance, were you to say as an overall category, you are exploring abundance, that would be accurate. Either you say, ah, I went bankrupt and that was my karma, that would not be in my perspective as accurate. So there are more overall general themes that you will choose to explore. And remember, using abundance as an example, when you explore abundance, you can explore both polarities of abundance. And so you can also experience an abundance of abundance. It doesn't mean you have to experience it as lack of abundance. It will always be your choice as to which polarity in the overall category you are choosing to experience. Does that make sense? Yes. All right. Is there something else? I was under the impression that I set that all up before I came into this conversation. Not the literal circumstance. There is far more leeway in allowing spontaneity in the actual circumstance. And what will happen is that the themes that you are exploring will play out in the path of least resistance from what's available in a given time frame. So you and I didn't have an agreement to have an interaction. I did not say that. Before. I incarnated in this body. In many senses we did, but that would be a more general theme. Not the idea of interacting, the idea of reflecting together perhaps. Someday we have to talk about something. We just did. Like that. However, are you to close your eyes, relax, speak to me in what you call your consciousness and then trust the answer that you get back. You can approximate my answer. So you need not create the elaborate scenario you call channeling to do so. That is only one way. All right. Very good. Oh, I thank you. Shitting. Elon. Hey. Hello, this is the first time I'm talking to you I think. This is my first time as well with all of you. For this is how we see everything. Coming back to what you were talking about before focusing and actually on abundance. I have tried to make a decision to focus on abundance. All right. Let's start there. Try to focus, to make a decision. Try to focus to several times removed from simply focusing. Now your wording is telltale. Pay attention to it. You need not judge yourself for having that understanding. Use it. The question is when you do focus on abundance, how are you focusing on it? Probably in my head. How are you stating it? I state that I'm an abundant being and that I will manifest abundance. All right. When will you? Or do you understand if that is how you word it? That's what you will get. Well, maybe that's why I'm not manifesting it. The idea is to understand you are already abundant. You already have what you need when you need it. Now that you realize that you need not use lack of abundance as an excuse to express yourself and when you begin to get into the movement and action of consciously expressing yourself according to preference in a focused way, you perform different actions than you would have. These actions have results. Some of those results will reinforce your ability to continue to perform those actions through various forms of abundance. Because directly in what you call monetary exchange, other times in other types of exchange that still have the same effect of allowing you to continue to be who you are effortlessly and naturally. So perhaps you can begin to look at it from that holistic point of view. Is that slightly different? It's slightly different. All right. But then I find that there are things in my environment or whatever that appear to be not abundant. You understand, but are there also not at the same time things that are amazingly positively abundant? Yes. All right. And this is what we are discussing. It is an excellent example. At that juncture, you have the ability to choose where your retention lies. One will reinforce your positive decision and prove in no uncertain terms this stuff works. Another will seem to be contrary against it and it will be your choice completely, your choice as to which to focus on. If you focus on what still isn't happening, that is what you will continue to create for that is the focus. Still not happening. Still not happening. Can't pay this. Can't pay that. If you turn around and say, all right, it appears as though I can't pay this. I intend to pay this and it is my intention to be able to pay these things as they come in to use one example. Now let me look at where I am already expressing my abundance. You shift your approach and then your actions remain consistent with a statement of positive abundance. If you use can't pay that as evidence for negative abundance, your demeanor changes, your focus changes, your actions change and it reinforces lack of abundance. Do you understand? Yeah. So it is simply a matter of focus. And when you say, I can't pay this, you are very focused. Therefore you can use that to remind yourself, ah, look what I'm focusing on. It's very blatant. It's very easy to focus on. But that is not who I choose to be. So therefore at first I will jumpstart my own process by consciously seeking where I already have blatant, no doubt about it, blatant evidence of abundance. Use that approach and you will immediately see a change across the board and understand that what is creating what you are experiencing now is an approach of shifting or focus back and forth, the windshield wipers of your life. Is that too simple? It's simple. But it makes sense. In applying it, you are being an abundant person and that is the whole difference. And abundance is something you already contain. There is a distinct difference saying, I am abundant. I can continue to do the things that are representative of who I am. Then saying the converse, I'm almost abundant. I will be abundant. I'm becoming abundant, which is the thing from already being it. So keep it in the moment. You're already abundant. There's nowhere to get. Now go and your job is to see all the different examples of how you are abundant and you will. And those examples will bring up new opportunities because now you're focused on them. The new opportunities will bring up new opportunity to act. The new actions that you would not have done with the old focus will create more of a perpetuation of the obvious abundance around you. Having done nothing but shifting your focus and acting accordingly. Play around with that. I thank you as well. Shitting. Hey. I have a question. Oh, I did have been requested that you speak up. Thank you. Thank you. About the Anastasia, David States, America, also known as the ancient one. I recently took a trip out to full corners of the United States. Oh, how exciting? It was very exciting for me. I understood in many ways why I went out there was to regather pieces of myself. I always had a romance idea about the nation's relationship with the country. I've been very interested in many ways. Many ways is why I went out there was to regather pieces of myself. I always had a romance idea about the nation's relationship and culture because of the higher the world. I was a little bit interested in the history of the world. I was a little bit interested in the history of the world. The idea is that what you call history is not so cut and dry as you might imagine. In the dimensional standpoint, you may understand that all of these things occur and which one becomes your chosen focus of your history will be an expression of who you are and what your exploration is. One way of looking at it, you can say there was what you call this e, there was what you call drought famine, and in that sense they withered on the vine, so to speak. One other way to look at it is that they indeed did split off into different tribes. A third way, just as valid depending upon who you are and what your history actually is, is that they en masse transformed by reaching a what you would perhaps know as a mass or societal threshold similar to what you call your Mayans, who also can be interpreted to have undergone any one of those particular outcomes depending upon your focus. Now we state this in this way for the following reasons. Because you are an infinite being, you truly have an infinite past and an infinite future, as well as an infinite present. Therefore, anything can happen in your future, so to speak, and you have more than one past that is just as valid. The mechanics of this get a little bit confusing, perhaps any more specialized discussion we can begin to broach them somewhat. But the idea is that there is not truly one event that occurs, that is the objective event, because once anyone is in that sense observing it, their perception is subjective. And so therefore, even if there were one common event, if there are eight people witnessing it, there are eight subjective interpretations that are all equally valid and all equally different. So this is one of the ways you can understand that things being the way they are is very arbitrary, and in fact a focus of how to look at reality. Perhaps to simply wrap this up as you say, I will ask you which one resonates with you as your past, which one will reinforce who you know yourself to be right now. Because whatever one you assume is the past, and act as though that's your past, no matter what actually happened, and again not one thing did, but were it even possible, it is irrelevant. It is only what you take and assign as your past that then has you acting a certain way in the present and seems to influence you in the present. I understand exactly what you're saying, and I like to believe that I was an honest virtual now, but I was an ace of american who lived for a natural virtual life, and I did transform and go off on to a higher level because it was time to, and I feel like that's what I'm doing now. That is exactly what would be my perception in assessing who you consider yourself to be. For that history whereby there was a mass threshold reached is the most reinforcing for where you are at and what you are about to do. Yes, and I didn't believe that was my whole point going out there, but there were moments where I was disappointed with the natives now. A lot of the nations who are very excited about keeping the old traditions alive, and then I was also with some Indians who wanted to be westernized, so I guess my consciousness is in between both right now. Well the idea is you are one such, perhaps you can say Indian, expressing yourself in your unique way, which is a combination of the two. Of course, I like the idea, thank you. But the idea also being that there is this perception, that it is more natural to deny your creations, for your creations distract you from spirituality. And in that sense, this is a bit of an naive attitude that is not particularly accurate. One more. Proceed. I was, you just said that it is natural for us to deny our virtualities, so were you just said to me? The idea is that individuals will sometimes assume that the denial of material, material, material, material, everything, including all the material of your reality is a spiritual expression anyway. And so therefore the question is, do you express it, do you use the material with a spiritual understanding? Therefore you need not deny your own creations, which have distinct advantages in exploring your spirituality and creativity and ability to invent an ability to participate and enjoy your own creations. So the attitude of denying the material is now not so germane to the understanding of understanding to include everything, not expanding and excluding some portion, and since there is no outside of yourself, anything you exclude is you. And it is only an illusion for there is no outside, no place to put anything anyway. So truly you are marrying these two ideas, all of you in many ways, and beginning to understand that denial is distinct from expression. Does this make sense? Yes it does, thank you. I also have a reason. By the way, I thank you for the reiteration. The reason that I had paused was to allow to see whether you had graphs but what I was saying. Then I did graph what you were saying, what you were saying. Perhaps you can say it was a pop quiz. Okay, you know what, I have a request from you, my ex-sony energy friend. I have many other questions that are personal or I don't want to take up time. But tonight in my dream reality, I would really enjoy accepting into that and I'm waiting up tomorrow with certain answers that I'm going to ask you in my dream. Alright, be clear upon as you say falling asleep as to what it is you are inquiring and be variable in the way that you will accept the information and the form that the messenger will take and we will be there. I trust that you will, thank you. Alright, thank you as well. Shh, that is. Oh, it is male, over here. Can I share something? Up to you. I like to. I opened up a little tent of mints last week that I got the firstness of organic governments. Alright. And in there there was an organic quote from Andrew Davis Road, I'd like to share. I thank you. Quite brief. If you advance confidently in the direction of your dreams and endeavor to live the life you have imagined, you will meet with the success unexpected in common hours. You will pass on a visible boundary. New universal and more liberal laws will begin to establish themselves around and within you. And you will live with the lightness of a high rotor of beings. If you have built castles in the air, you work the ugly laws. That is where they should be. That was the foundation of the foundation. I thought that was very beautiful. Is that not what I have just said? Yes, it was nice. Oh, thank you. What you have been saying for one time? I am playing around with you. That was eloquent. What's crazy? And inspiring. I get off on the fact that this guy was around 150 years ago and what he said from right out of your mouth. All right. This is not my mouth that reminds me, but I understand what you are. Also understand, as many of you do, none of this is new. It is ages old. What is new is the tendency for a mass clumping of entertaining it at the same time. This is what is exciting, one of the things that is exciting to us in observing the threshold that you are reaching as a society and expanding your consciousness. I thank you. Thank you. Can I ask a question? All right. I am just curious, thinking about the road may be wonder. Has he had any life since Henry David's road life? Do you want to tell us about any of us? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Interesting. Not at this time. I thank you for asking. Okay. Can I ask one more question? All right. Just fresh and I guess other stuff. I was thinking a lot about that stuff and feeling a lot about that stuff lately. My question to you is, and I think I might know the answer, but I am going to ask a question anywhere. What would your prescription be to man people to humanity? Honoring and maintaining focus on people's unconditional love of one another. Let us utilize your own example. You have what you refer to in the way that you interpret it in your society, catastrophes, and you can certainly focus on the ramifications of what you are labeling, catastrophes. Invariably, invariably in these situations, you have people coming, as you say, out of the woodwork to be of service. And so always do these symbols. Even the catastrophe symbols always contain both sets of evidence. Presence in humanity to man and for man, and people rising to the occasion to come to the assistance of others. So it depends what you focus on in that particular instance. Do you understand? Your willingness to consciously shift your focus on how this particular circumstance has illustrated people rising to the occasion is what will accelerate your experience of people seeming to change miraculously all around you. Your willingness to focus on the catastrophe and the inhumanity will perpetuate that as your experience and observation. Do you understand? So always be willing in assessing a situation if your tendency is at first to see the negative to at least balance it, as we had said about abundance and many of these other things, with only more sober view of the positive that also is contained within it. I was talking to somebody to break about that Jeff crash, and I was saying, well, I couldn't see any positive about it. But then as I was talking, I realized that what I saw that was positive about it is that for me personally, it made me feel more of a kinship with other people in the world. And other parts of the world that experience a greater amount of this type of apparently random violence. So it made me feel that just more like these are our brothers and sisters out there in all parts of the world. And somehow I would like to reach out to some sort of way. Like nurturing your compassion, that would still be what you call a positive slime. Yes. That's it. Why thank you? That was quite a bit. There will be but time for a few more sharing, sharing. Hey. That was perfect by the way. That was a really great sharing. I that's what I intend to teach with my project with Peace Clock is to let that be the initiative to allow people to see what excites them or find out the good things and these so-called catastrophes. When we discuss the idea that all symbols, circumstances, relationships, expression are neutral with no built-in meaning. And then you assign the meaning, you act according to the assignment of that meaning, and that is the effect you get out. We really mean it. And it applies across the board. In fact, were you to challenge yourself to actually see the positive in everything you will before it is there? That is the nature of an inherently neutral symbol. It contains equal potential for both, even if something seems, keyword, seems to stand out at first. It stands out because of your approach, but you can shift it. And the time it actually used the opportunity and the ability to shift it as an advantage, as a lesson. Right. Is that all? No, I'm going to ask you quickly a question that I guess is an archival question. It's about how we all are a Christ-consciousness planet, right? And that we've all agreed to do that. And that seems to be in our history, in different cultures, this idea of some sort of sacrifice in our ancient cultures. It was actually sacrificed to the flesh of certain terms. But I think overall, I'm getting this idea of that even Christ lived this, that we need to sacrifice something that is very dear to us on some level to experience letting go, and knowing that we cannot hold on to anything. All right. Well, that was one experiment. And you see the outcomes of such an idea. It is an approach, a valid approach. Perhaps in the literal sense, once you transform into a non-physical being, you can say you lost your body, your money, your house. But the idea is, again, from that perspective, you've lost nothing because it all existed within you to begin with. And there's no where for it to be lost, too. I'm more not material, but that's the thing that is most dear to us, to actually be able to find the courage to let go of that. The idea being that in allowing versus forcing, you can experience and enjoy the things that are dear to you. You need not give them up. And in a sense, if they excite you and you can act upon them with integrity, giving them up is self-invalidation and self-denial. It's the thing that is most dear to you. It will only be a positive thing to you and others. What would be the reason that you would be asked to give it up? Who is asking and where will you give it? And when I ask these questions, it becomes apparent. You are doing all the asking. You are doing all the assuming. You are doing all the choosing. Okay. To me, it has to do with my children. Again, and I just am looking at the issue that they live far away from me, and that for me to move to different areas, I looked at moving to where they are, and I believe that that was sacrificing a part of myself that I didn't want to do. I would rather move to where it really excites me, and yet I'm leaving something behind in a way because I won't physically be able to be near that so much. I understand. But even in those circumstances, you can arrange your reality. You can coordinate your reality in a way where you can experience both. When you are allowing yourself to be where you know you need to be expressing yourself, and you are creating the support to continue to express yourself, you will simply find it effortless to visit them more often as an example. When you visit them more often, that will begin a cascading effect that can open up new opportunities if that is where you wish to go at that point in increasing your involvement with them. But right now, denying yourself means even if you go to live with them, they are getting a self-denying being. Thank you as well. I have a question about the existence of an esosani elixir, and how does it serve you, and can we duplicate it? Define. A supplement, a nutritional supplement, something that is used to engage the physical energy. Speak up. Something to nourish you. Where in that sense did you hear about this? It just came to me. The idea is that it is perhaps a misinterpretation. In that sense, in our entire history, never did we need to supplement what you would have called our nutritional intake. Now as a society, we do not really eat, we absorb energy directly. There can be the idea of eating still. There is still the idea of what you would call vestigial mouth, vestigial teeth. But that would only be for specific reasons to explore certain ideas. The idea of supplement again assumes that we would be consuming something that was not in and of itself complete, and that was never our nature or approach. So therefore, in that sense, there is no elixir, nor was there ever a need for it. Now there can be things that were ingested for certain effects from time to time. Allow me to provide an example. You will have to, as you say, give me some leeway here, for I can only translate this in such a way that you will understand it, and by the nature of your language and the environment upon your planet, this will not be completely accurate, but it will do. Essentially speaking, perhaps you would say 99.9%, our dietary habit would be what you call vegetarian, in that we did not, as a regular idea, eat what you call meat. Now not by the way, because there is anything wrong with it or because we judged it, it was simply not our approach, and everything we need was available in what you would call perhaps plant or vegetable form. There is still a type of sea creature, perhaps in a sense, you would say a type of fish, this is not accurate, and it is not necessary to harp upon the detail. But it would be an example, perhaps you can say, of one of the types of meat that we would eat from time to time, but only in, again, this is not an accurate word, but we'll have to do a somewhat ritualized way in that when we will eat or would eat, for it is not very common any longer, this one particular seagoing animal, the result of the consumption would be to have the experience of seeing through the senses of that being when it was alive. No elixir, but an interesting story. Can you at least get some mental picture of this? It was understood that the being was aware that they were functioning in this capacity, so there was no breach of sovereignty. For we are in what you would call telepathic communication, and there is a version of this with what you would refer to as our animals. Thank you. Just a little tidbit. At this timing, allow me to once again, and for the first time, thank you for your willingness to synchronize to whatever degree it does synchronize, for you all maintain your individuality always, your focus to explore certain things along with us. We understand that you are already 100 complete, 100% complete being. We understand that everything that you want is right there. We understand that you already use a certain mechanism to create your reality, and so using it consciously does not mean acquiring new skills. It simply means being willing to even entertain the idea that you can shift your focus and then going one step further and simply shifting it. When you shift it to decide definitively who you are, not by stating, I am not this, I am not that, I am not this, which focuses on all those things, but by stating who you are, you are that person, and by being willing to interpret your reality through the senses of that person, you will prove it to yourself instantaneously using the very same mechanisms, the very same methodology that you have always used in your experience as a human being. I thank you for your willingness in that sense to share to whatever degree you have matched focuses with each other and with us, and I bid you a most fond and loving good day.
