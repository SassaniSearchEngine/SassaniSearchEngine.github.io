 All right. Allow me to say simply good evening. I thank you all for your willingness to interact with me and members of my civilization this evening of your time and entitle this interaction, if you will. Allow me. Purposeful allowance. We have discussed many things with members of your society over the many opportunities that we have had to interact with members of your civilization in this fashion. And we have discussed the many ways, the many mechanisms, the many ideas through which you express yourself as physical beings. As lifetimes, as statements of reality, as your version of reality. And we have simplified many of the things we have discussed with you down to the idea that the bottom line is that your reality is not something that you exist within. And that, at least if you allow yourself to look at it this way, your reality truly exists within you and is an expression of you. As you expand your consciousness, as you transform literally into more of yourself, your awareness expands to include the idea that the reality that you formally believe to exist within exists within you. This is a characteristic of the expansion of your consciousness in that you realize that your consciousness is the reality and the way that this plays out in your physical lives, in your approach, in your day-to-day interactions is that you express yourself in a very specific way. You decide who you are. I am this person. You decide. You trust in that decision, no matter what the criteria is for having come to that decision, when you then act or perform a series of action or outward expressions that then seem to move the reality around, to create and affect the action seeming to be the cause. This evening of your time, I wish to in that sense, discuss briefly perhaps the idea that your creation, your reality, your expression is really quite authentic and effortless and the preconceived notion, the previously expressed belief that you must make things happen, that you must force things to move, that you must push very hard against the characteristics of your reality in order to have an impact or in that sense shall I say a bit inaccurate. For you do not truly push or move or stretch or force your reality to express itself. If you wish to get quite specific and accurate about it, you allow your reality. You express the allowance for your reality to express itself. Now when you do so as you say, not fully, consciously or purposefully or knowingly, then the results of such an allowance can seem to have many random effects that you say you do not prefer. But the idea that you can shift your reality, transform your reality by simply redefining yourself, redesigning who it is you wish to be, who it is you desire to be, is truly not an act of pushing or changing or forming or conforming or restructuring in a very effortful way, it is a matter of allowing which is quite the opposite posture, quite the opposite approach as making, though it has as you say a more profound and far reaching effect. Simply pushing is tightening up, contracting, seeming to need in that sense to gather yourself and explode outwardly whereas allowance is simply allowing effortlessly, assuming the posture of and then allowing the outcome of any particular idea. And when you come to the place in your life, in your reality where you decide to decide who you are rather than have circumstances, individuals and situations dictate who you are, you literally allow yourself through the same mechanism that you had created the initial reality to make that decision. You allow yourself to decide which is completely effortless. You do not need to force yourself to change your decision, you simply need to allow yourself to be what you already are, as opposed to forcing yourself to be something that you are not right now. Since you are the reality, the reality exists within you, you already are infinite potential personified. And in order to express any particular chosen nuance of that infinite potential, it is not a matter of flexing your muscles and pushing quite hard, it is a matter of simply choosing and allowing the results of those choices to manifest, to express from you. As we have discussed many times, beliefs are not truly something that you have a belief and don't have an opposite belief. You contain it all, you contain all belief. So the idea is the belief that you express outwardly express, act upon, is what determines in that sense your outcome. And you can allow yourself across the board, you can allow yourself to decide who it is, you wish to express yourself to be. You can allow yourself in that sense to be something which you already are, as opposed to needing to become something that you are not. And the mere recognition of the simple turning point, simple key, can allow you to begin to allow yourself to be who it is you wish to be, you allow yourself to decide, either consciously or again you say circumstances dictate that decision. But you can choose what you allow, you can decide in that sense to allow yourself to be whoever it is you wish to be, or you contain it all. Then you can allow yourself to trust, then you can allow yourself to act in the way that is consistent with the person that you say you are, that you decide to be, that you allow yourself to be and part of that allowance of deciding I am this person is to allow yourself to act like that person. Now when that decision changes, for instance you decide I wish to change either my entire life or some aspect of it, the first thing you do is allow yourself to decide who you are to redefine that decision and state that decision and then allow yourself the slack to have that decision be a statement of who you are. In that sense it is up to you and it is not a matter of forcing yourself to decide who you are. You already know who it is you wish to express yourself as perhaps sometimes you see yourself expressing yourself in that way, other times perhaps you see yourself not expressing yourself in that way but you can allow yourself to remind yourself who you are and to have that decision about who you are be conscious. Now when you begin to shift your decision, change your approach, change your expression. Many times there is the aparency that circumstances, relationships, interactions have an echo of a feeling from the old decision and therefore though you may say I am this integrated positively oriented person a circumstance may come along where you say well look at that if I was that person this wouldn't be happening which is by the way a decision. In that sense you decide that your first decision perhaps wasn't true because look here is the evidence. Now I remind you though your societal approach is seeing is believing that believing is seeing. When again you begin to shift your decision your initial response to certain circumstances may still appear on the surface to be that same old disintegrated response. In our last interaction we have discussed in somewhat detail that you then will perform an action after you interpret your reality, after you have that response to circumstances, individuals or interactions and our suggestion was to place a pause before you act, allow yourself to remind yourself of your new decision, allow yourself to remind yourself how a person with that new decision would act even in this particular circumstance which seems to be coming up as evidence to the contrary. Are you following along so far? One thing perhaps we did not emphasize, perhaps you can say adequately for the way that you play out and experiment with the expression of your reality is the fact that that initial reaction that you may have according to an old decision is alright, is all well and good. Allow yourself to feel that response. Attempting to squash that response is in a sense not allowing yourself to express your decision fully. Ignoring that response and simply doing something else can have what you call a pressure building up within you that you simply are fooling yourself and not truly changing your reality at all and squelching yourself from having the initial response which many of you can experience as a build up in pressure and frustration. So the idea that we wish to emphasize as an addendum perhaps is the idea that it is alright, all well and good. In fact part of the very process to allow yourself without expressing or acting but allow yourself internally as you say to have that reaction fully do not squelch it, do not squash it. If you squelch something, if you attempt to stop it and do not allow it to express, you do not allow it to deliver the message that actually reinforces that the new decision is in place. By denying your initial reaction you are denying yourself and your new decision in many ways. By judging the reaction rather than simply allowing yourself to experience it you prolong it, you draw it out, you make it seem to take more time. It can last days, weeks, months in that sense of your time if you do not allow yourself to assume that even that response is not an interruption in your process, is not evidence against the decision but is supporting features and factors to the decision that have in that sense a shelf life. If you allow yourself to have a response even if it does not seem like the most integrated response without again acting without putting out but simply realizing you are having this response and allowing yourself to have it it plays out generally in a matter of what you call seconds or minutes, perhaps hours but generally not much longer. However, when you define that response as extraneous judge that response to be backsliding, not a representation of who you now are and perhaps judge yourself for having created it to begin with you are not allowing it to play out, you are not assuming it to be part of your process, you are not allowing it to deliver the message that then you can pivot upon and re-align, reorient, re-mind yourself to who it is you know you are. And so in saying do not act immediately, do not express and have an external output immediately, we did not mean in any way shape or form that you should not allow the full response, look at the full response, you are willingness to look at it this passionately, you are willingness to look at it maintaining your unconditional self-love allows even that response to reinforce the new decision rather than present itself as evidence to the contrary. And so therefore to again reinforce the idea, you can have a response, you can have an interpretation the response to that interpretation and fully allow yourself to feel it, fully allow it to play out without walking around performing actions with that of the foundation, without having negative discussion with individuals saying the things that are not truly representative of the new decision of the you that you choose to be, you can be with yourself with that response and if it is a negative seeming response and you allow it to play out, it plays out, you get all right now what, but if you attempt to interfere with it, if you play many more levels of judgment and self-iratement to it, it stretches out, it does not have the opportunity to be part of the process and the decision winds up being that it is an interruption in the process, that your process is interrupted, that you are interrupted, that your decision is nullified, generally spiraling downward back to the completely disempowered point of view which is always ultimately also a decision. No matter what you use as a rationale, when you finally say this stuff doesn't work, you're employing this stuff to provide the evidence that it does not work, which at least as far as my way of looking at it is a paradox and perhaps no judgment intended and irony for you are using the very power to prove you don't have the power and this is how all pervasive your power is, you are so powerful a creator that you can actually create the assumption atmosphere that you are completely powerless. Now I understand this may seem to many of you like word play, very clever verbose interaction and if that is your decision you will get the effect of this being only that, but if you are willing to entertain the idea that no matter what you will make a decision, that decision will stick, you will trump that decision and you will act as though that decision is so, you can in that sense realign to the idea that you are still using the mechanism. Then you are willing to have your allowance be purposeful, have your decision be purposeful, then your reality can begin to express purpose, can begin to express your desires, can begin to express the fulfillment of who you know yourself to be. In taking this one step farther the idea you call love we expand the definition to be unconditional love is also something that you in a sense allow or perhaps you can say disallow. If you are willing to entertain the idea that you can allow for unconditional self love, unconditional love by definition is love that is not contingent on any behavior, love that is not contingent on any particular outcome. It is literally the stuff that reality is made of, it is literally what you may refer to in your vernacular as the love of God or all that is because true and pure love is simply the knowingness that everything exists within you is a part of you may reflect things that you desire and things that you do not desire, but it is all you and your willingness to unconditionally love simply is the willingness to express that everything has the right and reason to exist and belongs although that does not remove your sense of discernment that does not in that sense remove your sense of approving in that sense of certain ideas and disapproving or having certain ideas still be valid but not relevant to you. When you judge yourself you and only you allow that judgment and it is a matter of allowance you cannot judge yourself unless you allow yourself to judge yourself and one way to look at the idea of judgment is that perhaps you are intermittently loving yourself but it is a form of very strong form of conditional love if I do this I love me if I don't do this I'm an idiot. There is no external counsel or panel or group or consciousness that judges you now there may be individuals who seem to judge you that is simply their external reflection of self-judgment but only will you feel judged no matter what the external appearance is when you join in on the party when you match the vibration of what you perceive to be external judgment only can you feel a negative effect of something that someone is sharing with you if you match that vibration within yourself judgment is not something you feel from outside judgment is something that you create a version of and then strongly identify often with something occurring outside but if you do not join in if you do not judge yourself if you do not place the conditions upon yourself if you allow unconditional self-love then anything else that anyone offers to you is simply a gift with the receipt to return it either it applies to you and you keep it or it doesn't apply to you and you don't period and again should an individual seem to judge you and you simply refuse to join in you simply refuse to express anything to allow anything for yourself but unconditional self-love you will not feel that judgment and perhaps what you will feel is a deep compassion for the individual for just as when you judge yourself you create the idea of a negative feeling so when you judge others you create that same feeling within yourself for judging others from the most integrated consciousness points of you since everything is you is judging yourself is momentarily removing so to speak you never really do but there is the appearance of removing the self-love or placing condition upon the self-love when you unconditionally love yourself fully and perhaps find yourself doing something that is not an accurate expression of who you determine yourself to be it is simple enough to simply use that opportunity to realign allow yourself to remind yourself of who you are and not create full-blown self-judgment out of the idea and part of the idea of expressing self-love is to cut yourself the slack to allow yourself to have responses to allow yourself to seem to have reaction if you do not act or express these reactions you will not create an outer echo reflection of it and all of the ramifications of that reaction will be internal you allow them to play out they resolve you realign to who it is that you know yourself to be for you have allowed that to play out you use that reaction to reinforce that you absolutely refuse to change your decision no matter what and then you act then you speak then you reflect you have not squelched anything nothing has built up no pressure no frustration simply perhaps at first you may be excusing yourself from the room a lot but that is all well and good for that is a perceived action on the parts of others and though they may at first scratch their heads when you come back in realign they will see an example that when a person makes the decision and allows themselves to maintain that decision purposely nothing can change that it is now a reflection of who you are and you now become a living example to the other individual not that you are anyway and responsible for them but you are being responsible to them by being willing to be a reflection of who you are and what may be perceived as you being rude and leaving the room will come to be appreciated as the process of realignment maintenance of the positive decision now where this all leads and as you begin to use your responses rather than negate them rather than judge them rather than create guilt which is lack of self love about them they deliver their message they play out an idea they reinforce your new decision and they this appear from your presence your response will only continue to seem to be the same if you do not allow it for what you are truly allowing it to do is serve a purpose you are allowing it to deliver a message when message is delivered messenger has no reason to hang around and so therefore it is not a matter of constantly fooling yourself that things have changed it is a matter of allowing yourself to express the change and using everything in your reality to reinforce the change and as that occurs your response changes for it does become dated and obsolete what we are addressing is the fact that when you first shift your decision it often does not seem so obsolete there is that reaction again I thought I changed I thought I was an unconditionally loving being here I am an idiot again that is a process that you allow you allow things to seem extraneous I submit as I often have in interacting with members of your society that nothing is extraneous everything is part of the process nothing is an interruption in it unless you say so in which case you create the aparacy of being interrupted you create the aparacy of something out of sync with the process but again the power docs the irony is that is part of the process and as you continue to label it extraneous you do not allow yourself to see how it is part of the process you seem to reinforce oh well extraneous things happen which is another version of a statement you have I will not repeat the idea of allowing is to relax to let go to experience thing and accept that though on the surface at first they may seem to run contrary to a new decision that you just made that they don't the moment you make the decision you allow the decision to be who you are the reality shifts immediately and therefore anything that occurs is a reflection of the new decision no matter what but only if you choose to interpret it that way and use everything if you understand that nothing is extraneous everything is useful and when something would seem to come along that would not seem to be useful and your first reaction is what possible use can this happen my reality by all means allow yourself to feel that allow yourself to get right justly and big enough allow yourself to think all always me but when it plays out ask yourself how does this serve me how does this reinforce my decision how is it actually allowing me to see where I still may have the old approach and not not express that old approach now one of the ways that we have defined this process whereby you make a decision something comes along you have a response a definition of the thing that comes along as being absolute evidence that your decision didn't stick that you then cave in and we assume a decision generally a less empowered decision but nevertheless always are you performing these steps so to speak automatically effortlessly you allow yourself to cave in caving in is not something that happens to you no matter what the appearance is and in fact again generally you then resist that caving in and what we are suggesting is that if that is how you choose to express yourself and respond allow yourself to cave in or even caving in can be used even caving in has a shelf life when you allow it and seems to extend itself when you resist it perhaps a simple rule of thumb is that allowance creates instantaneous expression and what you call resistance seems to stretch out expression there is often the idea that something could come along that is so overwhelming that if you allow that you will simply explode I submit to you that this is an appearance and that it is actually the fear of the fear that you are feeling rather than the idea itself if you are afraid to be afraid that is exactly different that is another layer altogether then simply feeling fear allowing yourself to feel the fear and then having a dialogue about how it serves you how it reinforces your new decision rather than negating so you can purposefully allow and it is all a matter of choice if you allow your life to be random always that is a direct result of deciding all right I give up life is random and still you have your decision that is registered and because it may have been an old tendency the responses and the circumstances seem very quickly to support the disempowered notion but when you change to the positive decision allow the responses to be part of that decision refrain from action until you are able to use that to realign to who you are and then perform actions consciously purposefully able then you see a change one other thing because you are linear being we have discussed the idea that consistently maintaining your positive decision about who you are can make changes very quickly in your life and that were you in that sense to even do so consistently without fail for about three of your days there will be noticeable evidence we did not say this in that way to challenge you and we did not say this to set up the atmosphere oh show me I can do that for three days prove it to me because the very posture of prove it to me actually has an underlying assumption that it is not likely or true and because that is the underlying assumption how you will respond and interpret the evidence will support that underlying function so perhaps you can loosen up on time frame understand that you will see changes but not if you focus on evidence to the opposite then the changes that do occur are apparent perhaps to others around you will not be apparent to you and the idea is to begin to entertain the idea of not needing to test your reality up till now your reality has been a marvelous exam this is the trial run if you will this is the statement and if you challenge the universe show me I remind you the universe is you and a challenge has an underlying supposition that failure is very possible therefore I again thank you for allowing me to interact with you to be a reflection of where you are now asked for although you may think you all hear the same thing in this interaction I guarantee you there are as many interpretations of what I am saying as there are individuals present both physically and non physically for you experience the version of your reality the things that you notice in a string of words you call a sentence are contingent upon your approach upon the things that stand out to you upon the way that you have expressed what you call your taste your desires and your particular approach your particular evidence gathering and so therefore when I interact with you when we as a society interact with you we do so putting out an overall intention and then allowing that particular message in communication to serve as many purposes as it will no matter what the outcome is with no investment in anyone embracing or in that sense rejecting any of my responsibility to myself is to simply share what I know to be true for me and trust that whoever I attract are just the individuals that will benefit from it however that is the extent of my involvement how you interpret it how you use it if you use it or not consciously is not of importance to me for I honor you as a being as a sovereign consciousness that makes your own decisions no matter what those decisions are and for me and members of my society disempowered decisions are still an expression of your overwhelming power and so we can find fascination in any decision your responsibility is to interpret this in whatever way you are trust that you have attracted things for a reason if you wish to and use it in whatever way you see fit unless you wish not to use it at all in which case all right ironically you'll be using it anyway allowing other individuals to have their own interpretation allowing those interpretations to be valid for those individuals without taking them on yourself and remaining minded and grounded in who you are also will allow your decision to seem to register a visible effect for if you are depending on the reactions the responses the interpretations the evidence the belief expression of others all you are doing is using those others as a symbol as a relief valve for your own decisions your own beliefs anyway so they only act as mirror whether you create those mirrors to be shiny and true or smoky and dark responsibility to is simply being who you are responsibility for is then taking on the out of responsibility to make sure everyone else gets it which is completely impossible remembering this allows you to let go allowing everyone to have their own point of view and allowing yourself to maintain your own as you consciously decide who you are because that is what you say that is who you know you are your reality shift immediately instantaneously and completely in the moment of that decision allowing everything that occurs from as you say linearly that point forward to be part of the process a reinforcement of the decision and looking not as to how something is interfering but how it reinforces the decision allows that decision to be reinforced most quickly I will now in that sense allow for what you call interaction for this is though it may seem one-sided to this point a dialogue that takes place and the dialogue is in a sense as though we are a room full of all right mirrored balls all reflecting off each other from different facets different directions catching the light from individuals that allow you to reinforce who you are catching the light from individuals that may not be a reflection of who you are all of which serves to allow you to continue to know to define who you are and so everything is of service and when we interact with you this is what we get out of it we get the reflections that assist us with our particular point of view with our particular orientation and the gift that you give us in interacting with us whether or not we so-called speak is a great gift that is held by members of my society in high regard and in honoring your sovereignty we also honor our own for your willingness to allow us in the expression of this honoring theft we all gain and we all see things about ourselves that we are now ready to expand and it truly is an interaction and not a one-sided event for everyone is both teacher and learner everyone and if you begin to allow yourself to see this you will know when it is your turn in that sense to contribute you will know when it is your turn in that sense to gather and to reflect and to define so if you wish you may now purposefully allow that your decision has registered and that everything from this moment forward as you say is a reinforcement of your decision no matter what has ever happened to you up to this point or your past or your perception of your past which is often inaccurate is one of your greatest rationalizations for continuing to make decisions in the present that are not empowering and not representative of who you say you wish to be the past has served this purpose in the moment that it occurred in the now moment that any event has occurred it's over and if you insist on bringing it into this moment it is not the past it is a recreation in the moment using elements using puzzle pieces from seemingly other things but you are creating it right now and therefore the past has no hold on you unless you rigidly and completely insist that it does then you will create the appearances that it does so as we move into the interactive phase of this communication I remind you that you are now in the moment you now create in the moment and it is up to you how you will continue to express yourself nothing is kept from you if you will but purposefully allow yourself to experience it. I'm having a little bit of difficulty in trying to figure out what you decide if you have been doing same last or do you physically know what you call any stained glass artist? For suggestion is that when you decide who it is you wish to be by sneaking out and you will vary effortlessly through allowance attract an individual or a symbol which can even be what you call a book that is already that person and for the time being perhaps you can say in your vernacular writing on their coattails mimicking their action in other words if someone else is already successfully expressing something that you say you wish to be avail yourself of them trust that you can attract them watch the things about them that seem evident to you contribute to their success and simply well it may seem like plagiarizing but it is simply becoming or being the same way and there are many examples obviously even using your own example of individuals already successfully engaged in that particular event yes. They have been I don't know any would you like to know what all that is the beginning you have allowed yourself to decide you want it now begin to keep your eyes out keep doing whatever it is within your immediate grasp that seems obvious and evidence that such an artist would do but begin to widen your field of vision realizing that you have now become a beacon because you have decided to attract an individual or again any resource it does not have to be an individual can simply be. Now that you have sparked off the recognition within yourself that you desire to attract an individual or resource keep your eyes open in eager anticipation not rigid expectation but eager anticipation ah this idea has occurred to me I can use existing model alright I summon such a model now I will go about my business keeping my eyes open for the fulfillment of that decision is that too simple it almost sounds alright you understand that the sentiment it is too simple smacks as you say perhaps expressing the idea that you don't deserve it which you do. It is that simple you deserve it to be that simple being who you are need not be an effort now it can have challenges and it can have things that you will rise to to expand your expression of that decision but it need not be a laborious and effortful process if you trust your timing on it and if you very clearly put it out are you willing to put out such a beacon and this applies to anyone in the room in whatever particular field or idea you are entertaining are you willing to put out the call for that type of assistance or role model yes or no yes alright you just have keep your eyes out and see what works for whatever that resource happens to be. Does that assist? Yes is there anything else that comes to mind? Probably a lot of things that are too much. The idea is that resistance to an idea contains jewels within it contains reinforcement of the new decision and the way to use that resistance paradoxically is by letting it go alright I see I am resisting this idea on some level as you seem to create yourself in levels but I allow myself to entertain this idea because simply because it is appealing to me and reinforces who I am so keep your eyes out or in alright. Thank you very much. Thank yourself shiny mirrored ball lady. Shut it. Yes ma'am. The greeting. What was I and I do come to you this evening to thank you for the work that you are doing with your civilization to people of this kind of service. Ah! To quote your vernacular? Alright. Don't mention it. It is my pleasure and joy. Do proceed. We are linked up with golden threads of life within this room for each being here is a golden thread of life and is loved dearly by all creation as the esosani and your association of worlds who are working with those beings in this solar system. We wish to listen tonight to you and your interactions and will be here this evening with those unseen with us of the archangels and the hierarchy of spiritual and and master. We send our unconditional love to all of you as equal. We thank you for your presence and allowing yourself to be known and seen by those who will also choose in that sense to recognize you in that way and simply will only add one thing. Very lovely analogy, very lovely idea, very lovely physical expression of the golden thread for you are all literally connected to simply embellish the image. Perhaps you may understand yourself to each be an infinite number of radiating golden threads perhaps you can say a cosmic alright porcupine of light for the threads do extend out in every direction including paradoxically inwardly and that is where many of us are able to meet that is where communications that you generally perceive and defined to be non-physical generally take place. There is an earthly perception non-physical communications take place out there but out there is accessible in here inwardly and so therefore anyone can tap into other ideas of energy in the way that it reinforces their decision of who they are and be aware of non-physical entities if in that sense you are so attracted. We thank you for making your presence known in such a public way and we thank you for your willingness to express yourself in your particular project and orientation of which we all, all everyone no exceptions in that sense work together. There are an infinite number of approaches and so there are an infinite number of projects who address them that is just the silly quirk of the universe. Will that be all for that? Yes I will. I thank you all. Shitting. Yes. Gruff mail. In past sessions we discussed the concept of creating our own reality and in light of what you said today that terms seems a little bit inaccurate now because it kind of implies a forceful almost manipulation of the subatomic level of potentiality and the form would attract our own reality perhaps be a little bit more accurate and if so what is the technique that supports that? Everything would seem to be more accurate from the linear approach though to bring it all back home it is truly a creation of consciousness which is an effortless expression that you allow. The idea of attraction in that sense is simply the idea of although you have the saying opposites attract and that has many connotations which we will not go into the physical principles so to speak from a particular point of view is that like vibration creates resonance to like vibration which seems to create an idea you call proximal attraction. So by deciding and being a particular person you vibrate again without getting too technical at a particular rate that then resonates with the relevant things ideas relationships people places that are relevant to that vibration and in a sense the harmony the harmonizing that is created by these vibrations allow one particular idea or perhaps many ideas to stand out from the infinite number of ideas that exist. Now is this more confusing or does it actually explain? No it does explain that nicely and the fact that you said the infinite number of potential ideas that exist leads me to the next part of my question which is there is a lot of discussion now about working with energies of either extreme integration or separation and that individuals will attract themselves into one of those two worlds and my understanding of what we learned in quantum physics what we talked about is that there are an infinite number of parallel universes that we can attract to ourselves so that gives why is there this concentration on this more of a dualistic system as if we are going to experience a schism of realities separation and integration rather than a whole infinite number of subtle nuances of those two opposites. Thank you. Generally speaking and that is not precisely how in that sense we usually presented but to address the idea generally speaking it is for the purposes of simplification and remaining focus and not overwhelming beings who express themselves in a linear way with many infinite facts but the idea that you are sharing is far more accurate in that there may seem to be what you call a divergence but it is not a divergence on simply two ideas it is an infinite number in one direction an infinite number in another with every gradation in between the point is generally simplified to simply allow it to very strongly represent the idea that what you choose what you assume the decision you make is what you will get and that is completely separate from anyone else's decision and what they get so no one else can suck you along for the ride so to speak and it is generally for the purposes of that delineation that we somewhat simplify it into that idea there will be more empowered less empowered responses and expressions and results. However we have also mentioned that as individuals may seem to branch off there is no apparent noticeable difference from the reality you are on each reality appears contingent each reality appears continual and does not present an awareness of other decisions because of the very idea of attraction that we are discussing from the infinite potential you vibrate at a certain rate everything else that is vibrating at the same rate stands out everything else does it now you can say the things that don't split off into a parallel earth a parallel existence and that is absolutely one way to express it but the other way to express it is simply you have shifted who you are shifted your awareness and so now what you see will be shifted and representative of the new decision the new shift and in that sense just to drive this on as you say this is why although reality is an infinite number of expressions you can even create the appearance you call finite you call linear because rather than vibrating at an infinite rate which allows everything to be apparent all at once you selectively vibrate perceive the things that vibrate at a similar frequency and seem to not in that sense perceive everything else which allows you to create an idea which somewhat is irrelevant in the infinite consciousness which is focused so they are all simply methods of expression did this clarify the out notion for you yeah but since we since our consciousness creates it all that I guess an aspect of our consciousness will experience each one of those infinite parallel potential universes but our ego mechanism will be focused in that one preferable finite solution absolutely more mechanically as an infinite being you have an infinite number of vibratory expression and part of the idea of linear is creating a seeming awareness of only one the others exist but because they are slightly different from what you perceive yourself to be they are irrelevant to you and they seem to not exist in effect they are simply vibrating creating resonance around them creating realities around them which are out of sync with your own perception is this more or less confusing it's perfect well thank you as are you all shutting female we say a tale for later there are many ways to look at it but for the purposes of simply remaining focused it is what you create and define as a portion of your infinite self that maintains focus in physical reality period generally it is overloaded with the assumption of other jobs which it seems to have a reaction to but it's main purpose is to simply remain focused you make a decision and your ego allows you to remain focused on that decision and its seeming expression and results now when you define it as something more and give it power and I will say very brazenly use it as an excuse it can take on different characteristics it can seem to be driving its own vehicle but that is an apparent the unsimply realigning reassigning the definition this is the portion of me that keeps focus this is the portion of me that will make itself known when I need to be focused and that is its only job it will seem in the sense to simply be a nuance rather than a controlling factor and it is simply the redefining of its role does that make sense or do you insist that it be more than that now that is a big job I just want to know where it sits in the spirits round yes everyone but I really think books it's like ego should be to the left and then we should be in a heart more where we go when you do that you are setting up yourself as a collection of parts rather than a whole often speaking about the idea of expressing integration while this integrating yourself into bits and pieces simply the way to categorize this to have it be useful is that you are not a collection of parts you can express yourself and absolutely get the effect of seeming like a collection of parts or you can simply remind yourself that you are one whole being with many different aspects that perform different functions but all are equal and honored as you choose now to express yourself in expanded terms in what you sometimes refer to as spiritual terms so pushing something to the left from my particular way of interpreting it is segmenting yourself rather than saying I accept my whole self you say as I expand sorry portion of myself ego there's no place for you and in fact you are quite obnoxious now I am being told you the idea is that you assign these designations and then have elaborate interactions with them rather than saying alright alright I understand I am maintaining focus I will use that focus I will use this idea and I will continue to express myself as a 100% uninterrupted consciousness with many factors oh I have done nothing is that helpful it clears up a lot but you know in every book that I read ego is separated it's almost like you should have one oh but then that logically to use your own language makes sense that it should be separate oh no oh oh therefore all of these books are valid all of them attract the readers that are willing to express themselves in those terms completely valid completely worthy have the right and reason to exist but you make your own decision and you can make that decision according to what makes sense to you or you can build up the volume of these books as evidence of another idea you can also look at the people who write them the people who speak in such a way and see whether pushing it off to the left has had any positive effect on their reality from your estimation my approach which is absolutely no better than any other approach I honor them all equally is to always grant myself through complete unconditional self-love the most integrated way of assuming that reality is an expression of myself and therefore I do not have the tendency to court an off ideas because I understand that no matter how as you say you slice it I am coordinating myself from myself and it can only be that way is that a little more clear so in order to integrate from the king of integrated it's just a focus that is the way to define it where you can use it in positive terms and not separate yourself out into individual parts which will run contrary if your goal is integration personal integration and if you should define something as a part of yourself give it as you say an attitude and then cast it out even in your own definition it not going to like that and you're as you say very literally setting yourself up if you leave out what you perceive to be one part of yourself you are not integrating expressing yourself you are saying nothing is extraneous except you oh ego which is an approach which has an effect if you embrace and redefine and reassign because you're the one doing all the allowing your ego did nothing to you you created an instance defined your ego gave it a role interacted with it in a particular way but it was all you allowing perhaps not quite purposely so allow anything that seems to stand out in relief as an individual entity to also be part and to have purpose purpose to allow it all right thank you as well shitting female I'm not quite sure have a word this question all right next question I'm in that sense can but I won't for the idea is that your words and your reality in your society in your culture are the expression of your beliefs and it would be a disservice in that sense to jump the gun so simply remove the assumption that you don't know what you're going to say and say it has to do with being here in a grounded way I'm recently understanding my commitment that I had to make it actually be here and with that by the way it was a bit more of a joyous decision than you are in that sense it was the idea that there is something to be had something to be experienced that is very unique with a lot of what you would call excited energy behind it and I simply draw this out not in any way to point you out not in any way to embarrass you but to give you the feeling in even the asking of your question of the sense of joyful expression of what you generally refer to as the soul in choosing this type of expression now the idea of committing may have been many decisions that you've made since do go on I appreciate what you just said on the level of the level but nevertheless more integrated I suppose by the way if you decide that needless to say that a parent see will be forthcoming and perhaps has been from time to time what we're having coming to is that the joy for it but but the problem I seem to have is something to do with I've experienced what it feels like to be here with complete energy feeling I don't know ground it's very grounded and in that place it's very joyful to be here and it's very easy but I find that I don't know how you either I lose my groundedness I lose some of my energy I would like to be here in that full energy grounded way more often without this up and down train do you find that you're fluctuating energy level corresponds to decisions and interpretations that you have in a given moment let me answer the question to say yes and therefore this is what we are really discussing in this interaction allowing yourself to have that reaction allowing yourself to feel that fatigue allowing it to play out then standing up brushing yourself off realigning reminding and since the decision is excited expression then seeking allowing from what's available one idea to stand out in relief as being the most exciting thing for it is not participating in exciting events that are representative of who you define yourself to be that causes fatigue in fact that is when many of you say I have in terminal strength and energy it is resisting those things assuming that things that are not representative of who you are will support you more than things that are that can be absolutely exhausting you can in that sense play around with that apparently in my estimation from the deepest level as you have said that you are asking this question no it does not and in fact you will actually find as you express yourself according to preference in excited terms allowing things to be exciting that what you eat is actually a result of that and not the other way around so does that make sense yeah so in the very present now I might see the food connection and things that it might be the cause of depletion and energy but in fact we're talking about you if you are willing to look at it as the effect then you can get down or back to the business of being causal and do understand when you first ask the question I will take the liberty of saying you did not sound very excited committing to your reality and so forth is that correct as you began to just merely entertain what I have said for instance that it was an excited joyful expression of the soul did you not experience energy and alignment physically how do it say it was yours ah all right thank you very much but that is a disservice to yourself and the entire point I am making is that you have sat in that chair gone nowhere simply shifted your thinking aligned to entertaining empowered ideas energy level immediately came up and nothing occurred other than you shifting your vibration to match what I am saying which you can only do because you first contain it which you can only make any sense of because you are also it all of you. So when I am with certain people that I am going to have said that can hold more energy that are maybe vibrating at a higher level you are vibrating at the higher level and allowing yourself to see external reflections of it though the appearance may be the other way around. So why does this feel like there is more energy when someone else like that is present or you another is welcome. Well very very literally because of how you are choosing to define and express it as you had said to me I feel it is your energy you are giving your power away to me now I will not accept it but your appearance will be that you have gotten energy from me that is absolutely impossible you vibrate and experience the results of your own vibration something comes along which is most attractive for you no energy is transferred from my direction so to speak since I am not really sitting here to your direction you match that vibration you become that person you feel the results of being that person which is a wonderful illustration of everything we are discussing have gone nowhere no circumstances changed and yet simply entertaining an idea for but a fleeting moment changes the way you say changes the way you speak changes the way you seem to feel all this cues you into understanding it is you and when you are willing to embrace that and in fact grab it by the horn so to speak and express it everything will become a reflection of that energetic self and even individuals who seem to all right mope around will suddenly become quite lively individuals who absolutely refuse to match that vibration will simply seem to move. When people talk about the power of energy in a group as opposed to a single person's it is largely an illusion it is my perspective that you only ever feel the energy you create and you allow different templates or models or frameworks to fashion that energy around but it is your energy and ultimately the framework template or model is also you so even if you were to say well I completely do not accept that this is my energy it's your energy alone well the jokes on you I'm you. Do you understand the point of view? How does that feel? It feels good but I need to press it to one more minute so I will press the point again so then it can be an illusion if I buy into it that the power in a group is much greater for transformation than my power alone. Then you can use that to express your power by all means but it is still you and ironically the group energy no matter what you are defining it will only be palpable to you to the degree that you mimic or create your own version of it so the same mechanism still exists it's just how you experience it and where you allow your power to seem to express itself that will seem to shift from your point of view. So if it seems more comfortable to have the group elevate you by all means allow yourself to express elevation in that way but remember because of the way you create other individuals you are at the whims of their particular expressions and perhaps from your viewpoint peculiarities. So it is another valid way to expand your consciousness but still contain the few what you might refer to as pitfall and now you become dependent on external sources. All the while while it is you expressing your power very creatively. Oh that is the idea you are all a perfect reflection of whatever it is you are expressing in any given moment at this timing. I will purposefully allow for a short break and we will resume contact shortly.
