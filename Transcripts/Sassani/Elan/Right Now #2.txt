 All right, I'll say continue sharing. Good day. I want to ask you about becoming the vibration of what you wish to be, which you know is going to be sometime in the future. I know it's talking about future, but still. Oh, the becoming versus being, proceeds. Somehow the timing is not there yet. That, by the way, is an assumption. It may be based on whatever evidence you gather, but the timing is always right now should you decide. So understanding this, by all means, you can continue to put out in front of you to become something. But what I am sharing and part of the point of this interaction is to understand that you are deciding that, and that you are building that particular, shall I say, condition into your decision. Do proceed. Can you say more about how to be that vibration? Deciding is being that vibration. There are different ways to word the idea of decision. One of them is simply that you always, in any given moment based on whatever criteria you use, every right now, commit to who you are. You make a commitment, I am this person. That is being that vibration 100% and completely in that moment, in that right now moment. When you decide, I am and fill in that blank, you are that vibration right then and there. Often, individuals will build into their decision, as you have said, the idea of becoming, and then you are the vibration of becoming versus the vibration of being, or the vibration of creating yourself towards being that person on a gradient. The question you ask is an excellent question, because it allows us in no uncertain terms to define that making the decision is being that person, and therefore, expressing that vibration right now in this moment. What you do from this point forward, and again, we are playing with language, it is always right now, but for the purposes of simply illustrating online, in the successive now, the decision that you quote unquote then make will either support the idea that you are already that vibration, or it will support the idea that you are one step closer toward being that vibration, or you can even create it to simply seem to cancel and stamp out that vibration altogether. This is why we say that you create essentially in three steps. One, decision. Two, trusting the decision, and another way to word that is maintenance, maintaining the commitment to that decision. If you understand that when you decide you are that vibration, you are that person, because you have established yourself as that vibration, trusting that decision is simply a matter of occasionally when and where appropriate and necessary reminding yourself of that decision in its full potency, in its full committed form. Does that make sense? So if I use some specific examples, like either moving in a particular house or getting a job, or doing something in your life that you want to do, and you are not there yet, other circumstances are not, have not fallen in place yet. So I knew already are of that vibration. Then the things start moving faster because you are already of that vibration. Absolutely, and you with very wide eyes are on the lookout, so to speak, for the opportunities that are available, that are present, that would seem to physically create the conducive circumstance that would then produce the physical result. Everything begins first again in consciousness. When there is the idea of physical events to play out, it always begins with the commitment in consciousness. Then your reality, so to speak, positions itself in such a way, whereby your circumstances are either a straight line, one thing at a time that expresses your decision of being that person to whatever degree is available in that given moment. Does that make sense? Yes. So therefore, when you make the decision, I am feeling the understanding within myself that it is time to physically relocate. That starts as a decision, as a concept, that creates a vibration that attracts circumstance into right now that allow for the conducive seeming transition again toward the idea of the physical move. But it begins with the foundational establishment of the vibration of that person. When it comes to everyday things, like making decisions that are going to affect, you know, either saying they are moving, you already act, I mean not you, but I would already act as if I am in that place. Well, so to speak, yes. You would do what you would do if you completely accept yourself as that being, which takes into consideration now that I am this being, I am this being in these circumstances. And what is available in these circumstances, this being that I now am would do this. And you are being acting, being that person, which then again creates again the seemingly shortest path, so to speak physically in the direction that you say you seek. Again, we are bumping up against what you call limitations of language, but is this clear? How about limitations of our reality at this point? That is a conception and part of the decision making process. There are no limitations toward being who you are other than the ones that you build into your decision. In other words, individuals will sometimes say, well, a lot, which is not my name, we have no names, it will do as a designation. Where you are, what you are saying is easy, but down here. It is not so practical to which I will reply. Well, that is the difference in the decisions we are making. Where I down there, I would not choose to see it that way, and therefore I would still get the same results yet in my society upon your planet. And I know this to be so, for I have again lived a past life on your planet, where I have seen in absolute application that this works. So, if you are familiar with my situation, can you give me any advice for me, specifically for me? What you do is loosen up on the specifics and simply understand that what you desire is to create a more conducive atmosphere to express yourself without needing it to rigidly be any particular place. If you insist that it be a particular place, it can actually take longer. If you loosen up and allow you to deliver to yourself perhaps through an unexpected avenue, simply something that will fulfill the atmosphere that you are choosing to create to support the new decision of who you are, you will find that loosening up will open up new opportunities and new ideas that were not available to you here to form. I am specifically and purposely being general. So, I decide to be surprised. All right. But the idea is to maintain your resolve in deciding that I am a person who creates the conducive atmosphere to fully express myself. And that takes care of it all, what you call your house and your car. Thank you, everyone. I appreciate it. I thank you as well. Shitting. Hi. It's nice to talk to you again. And to you for the first time. And for the first time. I would like to continue with part of Pia's question, and this is on the language, and I'll wear one might be right now. This specifically has to do, this last week I had my first official client. I started a practice in cranial sacral and energy and healing therapy. Oh, how exciting. It's wonderful. And it feels so, it really feels good. You sound like you mean it. Thank you. When I speak about this, and actually before this evening, or before I came here, I was saying, I'm starting a practice in this. And of course I've had one client in one session now that's in the public and things like this. So what is a better way for me to express myself? I'd like you to help me with your perspective on this. Well, simply, were I to be in a similar position, I would simply build into my decision the trust that I will attract individuals that will allow me to perform my service fully, and I will also trust that those who attract me can only benefit from my service by virtue of the fact that they attracted me no matter what the outcome seems to be. When speaking about this to other people, how what would be an empowered, that's not for the long, what would be an impact? I think I have, I feel the way that you just said, that if I run into somebody that I know in the health food store and I say, well, what would I say? What is your inspiration for what you might say to have a place to begin? I would say, well, we would say, hello, how are you? And I'd say, well, something really exciting is happening in my life. I started a cranial secholana healing practice, and I worked down in this area once a week. How about that? Sounds, as you say, good to me. Perhaps you could in that sense say, I have created or worded in whatever way to bring it into the moment, to allow the person to have the sense of the fact that you are already established and not necessarily a novice, as the term starting can sometimes connoisseur. For though you are beginning in that sense, this particular presentation of what you are doing, it is by no means the beginning of your particular service. And in fact, you have experience in that sense. I've been doing part of that for a long time. Okay, that's good. I'd like you to know that I'm considering traveling to the mountains and jungles and Peru to physically discover the blue crystal skull. And I think it'd be a wonderful adventure. Alright, make sure you bring our other friends. He may just be the one to sniff it out. I recently bought a small crystal skull, a contemporary one, and I've been bringing it to gatherings and meditations and things like this. And I remember that I saw one on a craft of yours. And I would like to ask right now your connection with them and how you see them helping, or I know that they communicated things, but how you might see their role in this exciting transformation and ascension that we're experiencing. And I saw simply a very fancy and unique mural. Was there something more that you were seeking? I don't carry on to this. Is it true that you, I saw one on your craft, I wondered what you do with it? Only loosely speaking was it actually that idea. It was far more an energy template model, if you will, of what you call human kind. It'd be like the template of the divine. Well, in a sense, perhaps you can say, alright, an intergalactic souvenir. Alright. Oh, well. The idea again is that it is a reflection, a mural. What you see in it is what you feel compelled to reflect back to yourself. What is programmed, so to speak, into such an idea is the holographic nature of reality itself. A point containing all points, and therefore very specifically reflective. Very individually reflective. And what you had perceived upon our craft functions in much the same way. All kidding aside. I saw it in the creative, what I perceived as the creativity room. Very, very perceptive, very creative. And that was the room to do it. Then just one last comment on this. A woman I met recently, who has this connection with some of the skulls and things, saw them being used in Lemuria, for example. When they seem to be communicating across the continents, and I would think that it was the priests and things like this were communicating. I don't know, certain kind of knowledge and maybe the update of their society or something like that. Would that be? Only in a sense for what you are perceiving as, perhaps, priestly hierarchy was really far more, shall I say, general, than your particular meaning of that term. Or that society was far more instinctual, instinctive, and less hierarchical and organizational. I thank you. Shutting, ice, female. We love you in Florida. Oh, oh, never been there. Perhaps I will visit one day. Hope and blood down. Oh, is that all? No, there's more. Oh, my, I suspect you said I was supposed to. I haven't heard of the skull when I was wondering if I should go out and try and find one. Is there a particular reason you feel compelled to ask anyone else but yourself this question? I'll try and get some information on what it is. Or maybe I don't need the information on what it is. I would just like to know whether I should get one. Oh, should? I do not deal in shoulds. If you should feel so attracted, by all means do. But the idea is there are no shoulds and only you would know. If you feel attracted to that symbol, then you can create a benefit from interacting with it. And again, ultimately, it is a tool, a reflection, a symbol. And all you find, so to speak, is more of yourself. If you enjoy the idea of removing yourself from yourself to reflect back to yourself different aspects and facets to yourself, then that particular tool is very handy. If you would like a more direct approach, simply decide who you are. It's up to you. But by all means, I understand that you can create the joy of discovery and search and exploration and digging many holes. Which simply truly represents your willingness to again begin to look at yourself on all levels. What will you do? I'll use the direct approach. Oh, now I am not invalidating any approach. And individuals create these tools and derive great joy out of using them as reflections. Do you feel that this symbol calls to you in this way? Yes, no maybe. I'm not sure about this symbol. I'm not familiar with it enough to know that I have any facility for wanting to get to know it. But if there's a more direct way, I think that would be more suitable to my purpose. Well, allow us to leave it on the following notes. It is simply one way to get ahead. I want to say that it has been exciting since my meeting with you. I've been exploring about myself and had some really nice reflections of unconditional love come into my life through people. Well, I thank you for creating it. I'm having a little trouble with abundance. I've been real good at creating opportunities in my life and the client's coming in and everything. But I'm not getting the abundance. What is your perception of what you are not getting? Where does your circumstance, where do you allow your circumstance to talk you out of your decision that you are indeed abundant? Whereby you're stating, I am abundant, I am abundant, I am abundant, seems more like a desperation to talk yourself into the fact that you're abundant than actually deciding to be abundant and then maintaining that decision and allowing the reality to reflect it, even though initially it may appear not to. Well, I'm obviously saying it out of fear when I'm saying how I'm abundant. Because it's the fear that's blocking the feeling to back up the diameter. Do you allow yourself to feel the fear or do you in that sense deny the fear and suggest that you should not be feeling it? I feel it and I can sweat some time when I feel it. So I acknowledge the fear and I believe that I contain the other beliefs and I go to the third belief, allowing and I guess maybe it's trusting. I don't know, I'm really stuck on it. But I believe that I'm not abundant, I'm not abundant, I'm not abundant. Well, the logic and the evidence isn't there for us. But as what I am saying, accurate. That is where you then insert the vibration and get the effect that seems to support us. That is where you then insert the vibration and get the effect that seems to support what you are calling the lack of abundance. Truly where it fits in our description is the trusting the decision. Not grasping at the decision in desperation, but simply reminding yourself, I am abundant. That my abundance is who I am. It is my method to express myself fully and have the universe, which is only a fancy label for myself, support my decision. And therefore then being unwilling to talk yourself out of it using an external set of criteria. Once you are willing to maintain that resolve, truly maintain it, truly place and register that decision despite any other criteria, external circumstances, bills and so forth. You will find that external reflection begins to change as well. But if the first time your decision appears by your reality to be challenged, you buckle in, you re-establish your decision toward the thing you say you don't prefer and then say see, here's the evidence. In other words, you are still making decisions and you are still seeing through the eyes of the decision. Therefore your power is right there, right now, and how exciting. Is this however practical? Well, that's just going to be. Oh, why? How does that feel? Actually, I felt a little shift there when I was talking. I guess before I wasn't really actually believing that I am, that it was in me to be abundant. Sometimes in the way that individuals will say I am in parentheses, they are saying I really wish I was. That is not committed positive decision making. That is, now I do not mean to give as you say this label a bum rap, but affirmations from a disempowered point of view. Now not that there is anything negative about affirming, but there is a difference between commitment and wishing. Is that enabling you to continue the shift? Again, I think I was just so outside of myself by saying that I am abundant. I think that is something that I think is something that I am not a fan of. Simply remind yourself that you have some say. You do? You have some please say. I can do it in other stuff that I create. Experience tells you you can do it across the board. And already do. Understand the perpetuation of the experience you are complaining about is still decision making. It will be mindful as to where you shift where you sometimes say buckle in. Allow it if you find that happening to be alright. And then realize, reestablish, re-decide. And in the moment that you do you are now the vibration of abundance. If there seems to be an external circumstantial time lag, it transforms very quickly when you simply maintain your resolve. Often there is no time lag or what seems at the time lag. Literally speaking, it isn't a time lag. It is a neutral set of props that you invest meaning in that you derive evidence from and that you then use to pivot and shift your decision. But I understand in how you lay out your reality in linear terms, you might say, well, that's an old effect. Truly when you understand, when you make the decision you are the new person, you then interpret that that is not an old effect. That is something which may appear to be an old effect but absolutely cannot be because you are no longer the person who generates those types of effects. And therefore it is your opportunity to use that neutral symbol to label that neutral symbol through the new decision which allows you to reinterpret it. And your interpretation of any symbol determines your decision, determines your approach and determines the effect you get out, not the circumstance, not the neutral symbol itself. Is that clear? Thank you. One question? All right, would you like to ask another? Yes. Person. And one of my, I don't know if it was a medication or a healing that I was doing, I had gone in the pyramid but inside my consciousness and down a little poor health. And then I was in like a liquid, like another dimension and I was a dolphin and I was swimming on you. Can we call that? My particular experience will differ from your own in that what you are interpreting as a dolphin is simply the appropriate, so to speak, physiology or vessel or body to move through the different atmosphere, that we shared. So it was not a literal dolphin. And there was other looked at it, almost like creatures, different looking, but it was beautiful. It was very, very beautiful and I enjoyed it very much. Oh thank you. I've been in touch more with my multi-dimensional SSN cell and it's beautiful. Oh. Really unconditional love that I'm learning and it's reflecting and all aspects of my life and thank you. Everything that you derive inspiration from is only as useful in that sense as you are willing to apply it in this life, in this reality. So by all means to derive inspiration from any direction, but only to the degree that you ground that, that you use that in this reality. Is it actually assisting you to create effortlessly in this reality? It has manifested the unconditional love that I have carried into this reality because what reflects him back to me and the relationship is just beautiful. Oh, are you doing that right now? That is the only time there is. Congratulations. Thank you as well. Shouting, thanks ma'am. With the American government with the debt that they've got right now, what is it, 5 trillion? There's a lot of speculation by different people predicting that there could be a worldwide calamity breakdown in our planetary system for collapse. What is your perspective from where you sit? My perspective is that there will be a shift, but it need not be experienced in what you call calamity terms. Perhaps one way of expressing it is that the system expresses a degree of imbalance and that balance is naturally achieved in an energetic sense in reality. Therefore, one way to look at it is that things are falling apart at the sea, but the more accurate way to look at it is that the water is seeking its own level, that balance is in that sense being achieved and that there will be shifts. There will be changes, but there is the under fabric, the under tapestry of the society, that is what you would call fairly strong. This is the best indication that it need not happen in what you call tumultuous or violent terms. There is a high degree of likelihood that a shift is occurring, but it is a shift for the restoration of balance. Does that make sense? Many individuals interpret this as the impending fall of civilization as you know it. That is not our perception. Is there something equivalent to the start market collapse in the 20s? Not likely. How about the set? That has to be resolved. It seems like it's wild at this point. That is part of the balance that we are discussing as well. And you will find again certain shifts in what you call the relationships of many of the countries, of many of the different factions upon your planet. There is a high degree of likelihood that this can work itself out in relatively peaceful terms to a beneficial conclusion, allowing for the establishment of balance as you, as individuals express personal balance. The rest of what you call seemingly external society falls into place. So again, if your decision is that you already are transformed, now you can begin to see these changes through the eyes of the evidence of the transformation. So from my perspective, it is all quite positive. Being that you are in the future, don't you already see these differences? Well, in a sense, yes. Will I tell you what I see in no uncertain terms? No. Because if you tell us, then you will be affecting our free will. In very specific terms, that is accurate. And my particular approach is to communicate with you in completely non-interferior of terms. It's all paradise, isn't it? Like a star trek? How many feet of fear? That is one way to put it. Yes. Non-interference factor. Not so much of a directive as a co-created agreement that honors your sovereignty, both as a society, but particularly as individuals. Honoring your power can only take the form of allowing you to make your own decisions and then experience the results of those decisions. Notice I did not say consequences, but results. Therefore, where I will interact with you will only be in the format of supporting your decision of allowing perhaps different options, but in no way insisting, in no way claiming that any particular methodology that we might introduce is in any way, shape, or form better than any other idea for to us. All expressions are completely equal and valid. Some may be more or less empowering on an individual and math level, but they are all equal. Therefore, when you find in interacting with me that I am choosing my words carefully, it is due to this particular agreement that I have. One of the just quick questions. Am I, anyway, involved in the society of culture or society in my future? Before I answer that, what do you think? Probably. Then you probably are. And I use this not to simply be humorous, although that is always nice. But that is the degree to which particularly in this situation your decision registers. And if you say, I am, you are. I can see it. I can then see your involvement clearly. If you say, I am thinking about it, then you are thinking about it. That is vastly different from being it. And then my perception of your involvement shifts. Do you wish to restate that? Oh, yeah. All right. Now I can see you. What am I doing? Ah! You can tell me. Well. I'll get you started. You are enjoying yourself. You can take that from there on your own time. Feel free to report back to the group at any time. And thank you. Even though you pop in and out, when you are there, your company is a pleasure. Oh. Thank you. Shut it. Hey, it's male. You see, your scalp cracked. Are the edges, the outside edges have a radius for the square? Part edge. Are you asking, are they coming to a point or flattened? Yes. Or flattened. With what you would call loosely speaking a light at each of the three corners, so to speak. Now this is eight feet thick, so is there a light on the top and on the bottom of the ends? Sometimes. Oh. But what you would generally perceive as one in dead center, so to speak. Of the end, each end. Right. Okay. Again, the craft is far more variable than you might imagine. Yes. I understand that. And this lens dipped on the bottom, there's a round circular lens that's on the bottom of the... In a sense. Lens is a very loose term. Well, does it emit light? It can. It can be opaque. It can, in that sense, be clear. It can emanate light. It can be many things. Oh, it will vary. Sometimes. It will represent what you call sensing apparatus. Other times, in that sense, it can actually put out an energetic stream for particular reasons. There are many, many different purposes for this. Maybe making craft circles. I will let you decide that on your own. Yeah. People that, yes. Oh, right. Then in people's universe, it is true. Does your sun affect your sky France when you fly or close by? It depends how you look at it. In the way that you are perhaps asking the question, not necessarily. Well, does your sun affect G.F. solar flares on your sun? Not in the way that you do. We do. The emanations from our particular central star perhaps would be interpreted by you as being more consistent and smooth and less tumultuous. Understanding, no offense intended, that your particular perception of your central star will always be a reflection of your own consciousness. So this idea of solar flares that we've experienced some of our planets, they've affected us much more magnetically. If you say so, the other way to look at it is that they emanated from your consciousness. Well, this one, like in March of 89, I believe, there was a pretty big one. And it affected a lot of physical things from radios to power plants and all sorts of things we didn't hear about it, but I understand that. Oh, right. So will that increase according to our consciousness as we expand? It will alter according to your consciousness as you shift. Whether that is an enhancement will depend upon the shift. Well, this possibly expel another star, so the Korean affinaries system, no way. This second star. It is not the likely, shall I say, outcome of the type of star that you have. Okay, thank you. I thank you. Female. Right now, I'll title this session, and that seems intense for me. So, would you like to change it? I'll save my life right now. That's the way things are moving right now. And I'd be screaming because I was consciously creating. And when I'm not, I'm getting random. And when I get random, it becomes very confusing. But what's very empowering is knowing that it can change that. Right now, wait. How are you? And I'd like to share that because it has been a very empowering three or four weeks. And just knowing that I can do that. By the way, it has been a very empowering life. And it is simply that awakening to the idea of your power is quite desirable to you. Now, we could entitle this interaction, be there then. If you wish. But perhaps right now would be slightly more useful and less random. Right now, the energy is the only, it is where it is. It's right now. Here and now, the only place and time. And if you are already complete, then your life is an expression instead of a desperate becoming. And regardless of the fact that in this right now moment, you may feel that you do not live where you wish to live, do not have the money you wish to have, and so on and so forth. Only can you attract these external reflections most quickly by shifting right now and committing to that decision. And allowing the external reality to support that decision, which it has always done flawlessly anyway. It is not a matter of making your reality conform to your desires. It is a matter of allowing it. And that term has the connotation that it's already happening right now. And you are simply allowing it very effortlessly to flow into your view, into your immediate experience and perception. Right now, it all exists. Right now, you are already that person. There is your power. All right, you sound like you do. I have experienced that. And what's more empowering is that I can change it. Do you believe that right now? How about right now? Right now? Thank you. All right. I have been waking up in the last few nights, week anyway, waking up in the morning with an unluckier stomach. And just upon waking things, I could don't know where I've been, but it just seems like it's been a little... All right. So, may I ask you a question and will you give me, as you say, the most honest answer you will? Oh, one. When you feel that, honestly, what is your first decision? What is your initial interpretation? I'm going to throw up. It feels that way. Like I'm very slowly... Then what? Then I say... What is your decision about a person, about to throw up? Then I... I told you to find out. And I say, okay, we're going to create another feeling. And it does go away. Is your interpretation of that feeling, I am sick? Or I am well? Or something else? What I really feel, but I really think. Is that I'm transforming to something going on this happening? Period. Oh. So perhaps you have a little bit of fourth density transformational sickness. The point that I am truly making is the idea of defining it. I am well. I feel this particular way. This particular way is often interpreted by my society as I am sick. What perpetuates that feeling and creates continuity that results in the experience you call sick is the decision at some point, the agreement at some point, that what this means is that I am unwell, or I am sick. Therefore, utilize it to remind yourself that I am healthful. I am well. And your willingness to do this in a very short time allows it to transform. Well, I've done that, but why is it happening? Because I will suggest that you have not completely done what I am saying. Before, as you say, you go to bed at night, do you drink water? Yes. I drink so much. One time, two or three, I don't know. Oh. This night of your time do not. And upon waking, drink something. Oh, right. I understand that seems like an unusual thing for me to say. I will ask you to simply trust me on this one. Oh, right. I thank you. I am shitting. I also have a question about a physical phenomenon. It may be related to what may be described. For a time now, I have a sensation in the area of my solar plexus, third chakra. It feels almost like a vacuum. There is a continual feeling that another way to describe it in our brain is that I would be a pit in my stomach. Before you proceed, what is it that you are holding back from doing? Now, if you wish, you do not have to answer. Well. But if you will answer, then go ahead. I have some relationship to end. Does this make some sense? Absolutely. Often what you call solar plexus can be interpreted as the chakra of intention. Therefore, when you feel a void or what you refer to as a pit, this generally will represent the idea of knowing darn well who you are and not being willing to in that sense do that thing, holding back, so to speak. Take your time. Enjoy the sensation. When you are willing to completely commit to who you are, you will immediately see what you call transformation of this particular syndrome. Okay. Thank you. I have done nothing. Shady. Hey. May I? Yes. You are talking about this time right now. Since that is the subject, my question is if this is right now and you are existing in our future, can you go into that a little bit? About your right now, our right now, etc. Thank you. In representing myself as existing in the future, this designation is relatively speaking arbitrary. My time stream is completely different than your own. Perhaps you can say compared to your own simply runs at a completely different pace. Were you to compare my time stream to yours and truly they are irrelevant to each other. So comparing them again is also arbitrary. My time stream would appear roughly speaking. It flows at a completely different rate but it would appear to run faster than your own. Approximately ten times. Again, this is even arbitrary due to the fluctuating nature of the way that we create time. Therefore, one way to interpret it is for instance that a year of your time, compared at the same time to our time, would play out as ten years of our time. But this is all quite arbitrary. This is only even relevant when talking about our time streams in comparison to one another. In actuality, again, our time stream is truly irrelevant to your own so much so that without an adjustment, for instance an adjustment which allows this type of interaction to take place, we simply would not physically perceive one another. Part of the way that what you call multi-dimensionality expresses itself is that many different realities exist within the same physical place and do not perceive each other because of certain differences. One of those differences is what you would call the flow of time. So saying that I am in the future is only accurate when you speak of our time frames in comparative terms. If you were to lay them down next to each other, I would seem to be in the future and accelerating ever farther into your future. To us, time is quite different than your experience of time. For we understand time as a property of an object and not something that an object exists within. Therefore, when we speak of the vibration that places an object in a particular coordinate in space, we also refer to another aspect of that same vibration as being their position in time as well. Now, not to get confusing, but the idea is that because we understand this relationship, we have created through technology, which is ultimately only again a reflection of our consciousness as well, the ability to manipulate these variables therefore have a type of conversation such as we are having. The way that our crafts quote unquote move is to literally recreate their vibration not only in space, but their vibration in time as well. Because we are able to measure the vibratory expression of an object, we also in measuring that can measure the part of the vibration that corresponds to time. So the measurement is a time space coordinate. Therefore, time to us is quite different than you. And because of the ability to manipulate these variables, we can quote unquote travel into the past quote unquote travel into the future. But literally, we recreate ourselves inserting the new vibration. So it is not really going anywhere as much as simply recreating the definition of who we are, which now automatically takes up resonance in the corresponding time space coordinate. Did any of that translate at all? I got a chunk of it. Oh, what? A chunk may have to do? Yes, it may. All right. So I understand that you're able to manipulate things enough to make the connection between our two different systems. Can you? We, in making a communication such as this, create a link that is synchronized in the two time frames. Although from my and my perception of this interaction and the time in which it plays out will still vary from your own quite differently. All right, but it's still your now. Well, it's always my now. It's always your now. That is perhaps you can understand to cut through much of this the nexus point in which we meet. Yes. Is that does that mean that you can also manipulate things and go back in your own past in your particular system? Absolutely, but if we are to exert any influence, it becomes an alternate path and not what we consider to be our actual past. Again, we are dabbling with semantics here. Okay, I got enough to work with. Oh, my. Do not mean to labor you. I labor myself. Oh, why? Perhaps it will be a labor of love. It is. Oh, allow me to thank you all for your willingness to synchronize your time stream to our own. For understand, in no uncertain terms, though right now you create the idea that I am doing it all. I do not call this a co-creation for no reason. Everything I do has some reason whether I know it or not. But the idea is you also create the synchronization. And this allows you to see that you are already expressing your power right now. For this gift that you give us, I thank you. And I bid you a most fond and loving. Good day, good evening.
