 Oh, right I'll say, how long you all have been receiving of your time as you create time to exist. We begin this interaction this evening of your time with the idea that within your recent timing you have celebrated as you say, the idea you do label New Year as our communication in this fashion through this physiological channel did begin in your past year, your year, nineteen hundred and eighty-nine. We, in a sense, one moment, nineteen hundred and ninety. We, in a sense, do consider that that year is a year for this group, for the energy within the idea of this group of initiation. Any label described in this manner is of course arbitrary, but it can be descriptive of an idea that we all convey. As our ideas were, in a sense, initiated in an accelerated fashion through this group, that label may apply in that situation. You may consider then that this year, your nineteen hundred ninety-one, is the year of implementation, of inspiration. For you will now begin in an experiential sense to implement these ideas, to act on these ideas. As we have said, the mental foundation, the philosophical foundation is all well and good. But what does create the change, what does create the existence of what you label, your vibration, is determined not by so much the idea of your thoughts, as the idea of your actions. And therefore, as you do begin to implement these ideas, oh wow, that, which you have accumulated, the knowledge that you have accumulated during the past year, to come to the surface, and become, as you say, utilizable. You do now begin to implement them in action in your life. Again, the action is in and of itself the aspect that does change your vibration. And in the process of beginning to allow yourself to move with your excitement as the foundation, you will find that you will have inspiration for by its very nature, allowing yourself to act as a true reflection of what it is you have chosen to explore. By part taking in this physical existence, you will find yourself to be moved from within, to be inspired. And it will become in a sense much easier for you to move, to ask for, as we have said, by following your excitement. You are automatically led to the idea of the next thing which will excite you. It is a never ending friend, if you will, that will allow you to obtain the idea of whatever it is that is your clear intention. That being established by your excitement. Therefore, we perceive this will be, as you say, a very busy year for you. And within the idea of functioning in this way, you will reap the benefits of which we have spoke from time to time. That being the support of the universe, the abundance necessary to continue to do what excites you. And as a bonus, being the truest reflection of who it is you have chosen to be. You have explored for 25,000 of your years other ideas in exploring the idea of physicality in and within the parameters of exploring limitation. And this, again, transformational lifetime will allow you in one, one lifespan to partake of both. For this unique, transformational life has that quality where you do seemingly begin in much of the limited fashion you have become accustomed to. But you then get to compare as you transform away from those limitations, allowing yourself to draw from who it is you truly are and move within this idea. When in fact you do feel from time to time as you have expressed to us that happens in your civilization blocked or lack of movement simply again. Look around, decide what is available. Do not in a sense concern yourself with that that is out of your immediate reach. Only from what is available move on the most exciting action. And you will not stay blocked. Although again, a block is only a seaming net idea for you are never blocked until you do label a particular neutral situation as a block for when you do. Your actions reflect that you believe most strongly you are blocked. As we have said, your actions determine your vibration. Therefore you will create a seaming net of being blocked. But at any given moment this can all be bypassed by the idea of simply moving on your excitement. Grant yourself this idea for you deserve. We have expressed pleasure at this time of continuing communications with your civilization between your civilization and ours, respective civilization. Therefore we find great joy within this idea. There is much acceleration occurring upon your planet at this time. You may choose to view it however you wish. Our suggestion will be thus. We have spoken to you about the idea again and for the first time that everything is fundamentally neutral. When we do express this idea to you, it is not that you neutralize each situation and leave it that way. For in the neutral mode it does not aid you in moving. What is actually possible and in fact what we mean when we speak of validating a reality that you do not prefer is not to leave it neutral. Now the idea is to glean actual positive service from it. So not only are you able in any given situation to determine where do you stand compared to an idea. If you do, prefer it or not prefer it, but you also get to take that which you do not prefer and again not leave it neutral but glean positive from it. A simple suggestion would be as follows. A tendency has been within your society. When involved in the, shall we say, situation of giving your power away to anything external. A created, steaming that again of why is this happening to me. When you do find yourself out of habits, out of habitual ritualized thinking spewing this statement or anything of that nature, you can turn it around. In but a moment, someone with a simple statement, catch yourself, realize you are giving away your power. Why is this happening to me? Does not admit and acknowledge that it is happening from you. Simply this statement will be of service to you in any given situation that you determine might have been from an older perspective negative. And that is again how does this serve me as it is. Simply by shifting your perspective that my new amount from why is this happening to me to how does this serve me exactly as it is. You are taking what you have formally labeled negative neutralizing it and pushing it over to the positive side. That is validation. Not leaving it neutral and saying alright alright and pushing it aside now. You can actually go that next step to glean positivity from it and you will find that is the advanced class. That is the idea that will allow you to take what you have considered in your past the worst of anything that occurs to you and make it into service to you. Make it into growth. Make it into an opportunity to further define yourself. When your weaknesses become your strength shall we say you are then without weakness for you only create the idea of weakness anyway. Therefore from our appreciation to you in allowing these communications on a continuing basis and acting eyes and bust the doors and diplomats from your civilization allowing me to reflect to you what you already know from our respective civilization. I ask you now how may I be of service to you remembering again that you are always being serviced to yourself anyway. Simply allowing me to provide a reflection of what you already contain. For you cannot perceive any reality or not the vibration of and your ability to perceive any given situation is your definite indication that you do contain it. I ask you now again how may I be of service to you change. Hi how do you do you do you do you do you do the area like what in a sense we have been very busy observing and keeping an eye out on the transformation that is accelerating upon your plan but not even an intrusive wife. I have those I the acceleration quite a bit. Just getting out of here. And you're giving a lot of our electrical things and interactions with you and my life has been fun. You're quite a fit in the area. Thank you very much. Realize when you have that thought that is your validation for that idea not necessarily that you need to ask simply that if you feel it validated you are worth it. Thank you very much. Do you have another question? Thank you. You're sharing. The idea would be to continue to do what excites you for generally some aspect of a situation will be immediately obvious as to how it does serve you. But if it is not it will become apparent that often in that situation which is the exception rather than the rule you can again usually immediately glean some idea if you are honest with yourself. It would then fall into the category of particular timing of your way of your chosen way to unfold. In reference to illness or something probably negative. All right. Define. You would ask yourself. Am I doing what excites me the most in life? Most often you will find you are not. If you then grant yourself the opportunity the allowance to move in that direction. Very often that in and of itself will bring to you either the message that you are delivering to yourself or the reason you are creating the illness or the pain to begin with is because you are not following your excitement. You are resisting your inherent ecstasy. You are denying to yourself who you most truly are and as we have said that creates friction. Thank you. Friction. Sure. A long, same mind as that. Are there ever cases. I know in my case there's been times where I've been excited to do something and something will happen so I'm not able to do that or make a trip somewhere. A lot of times when I'll say well maybe I would have had a car accident on the way or maybe something would have happened or I think sometimes people just say well maybe something bad would have happened or something not preferable would have happened to me had I chosen that route. Oh right. That is one perspective and you may use it. But we suggest again that that does come from a slightly negative standpoint. More rather than what might have happened, what might have been prevented. Where are you now because of it and what is available to you because you are there. You may find the opportunity within that scenario. Again always bringing you opportunities. While you are home for instance not able to go to a particular location. What can you now do? I've been given an opportunity to be here and by looking at it that way you are taking back your own creativity. You are owning it and then you are going a step further and greening what can I now do and you will find it valiantly. That there is something there to be done. That will assist you in a most strong way. If you do deny the idea then sit around and say oh for me. I really wanted to go and harp on that aspect. You may not be allowing yourself to green the opportunity. This is all right. It will come around again anyway. But you can capture the first time by simply making the best of where you are at. Realizing you created being there. Therefore what does this now allow me to do? Does that help? Yeah it does. I think even more with helmets or something it is very difficult when you are in the midst of it to say to green positive. Oh honey, did you say something? But recognize that in another self is a definition. And again someone coming from the perspective of poor me. I am too ill to green the positive. This just a definition. In any given situation you can allow yourself, not force, not make, simply allow yourself to view what is most obvious. Very often you are looking for something around some corner and it is right there in front of you. When we ask individuals well let's play a make pretend game. What might you have gotten out of it? We immediately get answers and those are the answers. Very obvious things that any given situation can allow you to do. Was there a specific incident that you would like to discuss along these lines or have we answered the question? Hey, would nothing your personal is just kind of a thing to tell. Thank you very much for your shit. Shitty. For sure. Hey. Good evening. How's your mirror? Good day. Where are you? I can't. You just go check? Right now, I am upon my craft orbiting my home planet. How about the sun? I have a somewhat confusing question because maybe it reflects my confusion about something. But recognize all confusion actually is this co-using. Taking many ideas, using them together, leaning meaning from them. Generally a very positive state that allows you to reorient. Although you have been taught within your society from the time you are quite small, very often. In order to reorient, you must first this audience. Go see. I have been grappling with what appears to me to be some apparent contradiction between the following ideas of a corner. One, we create our own reality and therefore we control our life so to speak. Number two, there are no accidents in the universe. Number three, our spirit goes on forever. And when we die here, we transition into wonderful joy and excitement. The last one is we prefer peace, not worry. I see all those sort of fighting one another to an extent. For example, very timely right now, why worry about whether we go to war or not? Why worry about whether we emanate that we want peace? Why worry about safety? Because it's all going to be wonderful anyway if somehow we die. Why should we worry about helping serving children that they chose that life? It's no accident. That does not mean that you must condone the idea of this. If it is your pro-entity shall we say to aid and assist in these manners? Again, a very dogmatic approach to this idea, may I say. But, it is not again. One moment. Can you be a bit more specific with your question? Okay. Take someone close to you that is dying. And until, let's say, 32 years ago, and before that, like both people on this planet, I would have had great concern, great compassion for their suffering, for them dying, maybe too young. They should live longer. What a shame that they're leaving. Keep writing why worry. Statement why worry. There is no reason to worry for why do you worry. Nobody has that expectation. Very good and understand that worry. Fear is that you believe that fact scenario is most likely, and then fear the consequences of that scenario. Add that can be negative within your own experience. But it can only be if you allow it, if you are of that vibration. Trust me. Well, to complete my thought, I no longer look at death with fear, or even uncertainty. I look at it, you know, less compassion than may ever more. All right. You don't have to lose the compassion. If we understand that it's the destiny of a particular individual that you may assist them with that transformation, with the knowledge that you have, with reflecting to them who you most truly are, you do not have to remove your concern. You do not have to remove your unconditional love to all beings. Recognizing again, everything is all one thing anyway. And you are a part of that one thing. You would then act in accordance with integration, understanding it is all one thing. You are a part of it. You may aid in its fist and be of service to anything within the creation you do. You do not have to lose compassion. But there is a far and vast difference between the idea of feeling sorry for someone and reflecting to them your reality. Your perspective, feeling sorry for them in a sense, does support their feelings of helplessness by unconditionally, lovingly, reflecting to them who you are, you present an alternative to them, and that is of service to them. Proceed? Well, okay. Take the situation. My children learn to drive, and I'm somewhat, you know, a constructive matter, saying, hey, you're taking risks in the way you drive that make me nervous. Why don't you try to stay alive and not kill yourself through some stupid maneuver on the highway? All right, but that is your judgment of the situation. I would think that they do not believe they are endangering themselves. Trustee? Oh, I'm sure they don't, and I don't agree with their judgment. All right. That is your perspective. Okay, well, I have to think about what you shared with me. It just seems that they fight each other a little bit, and that's what I could feel. You can create it that way, but the idea is everything falls into place. If you will allow yourself to see that that is so. Again, if you can be a bit more specific, we will address the point. If not, we will sit with share with another, and if it occurs to you, come back to that idea. I'm just going to pass on to thank you. All right, thank you very much. Shelly. Michelle, when you do the sessions, do you, I thought there was one time when you had said that you'd like pre-taste, like in the analogy, I had since we came up with, was the possibility that they do three elite sessions of one show and then they show it one night or three times on the top of TV. Sometimes from our perspective it occurs that way, not always. Also, if you're in re-trying doing the sessions in, yeah, that's the same time you could be doing the 19th session. In a sense, though that is not the case at this time. Right. Is that all? Yeah. Thank you. Shelly. Hey. About three weeks ago, I was lying down about to go off to sleep, and I was getting a lot of energy in my life. And I just kept my eyes closed, and then it was not in my head. It was coming through my crown, like very, very intense. Oh, that is great. And I just kept my eyes shut and kind of detached from it, but everything was going on. It lasted for about one to two hours, and then I don't know. Did you tell me what that was? And you didn't have anything to do with this too much. Was the idea that you say flowing inward or flowing outward? All right. We do put a theme in the sense you are energizing certain centers that will allow the facilitation of those communications. In our interactions with you, we are in the sense that allows you to free your heart centers. And that is but one of the centers that you will utilize within these communications. You may notice various sensations in the upper areas now that we have freed that area. For at that time, that is where you have created the symbol of blocking your energy. Now that it is free flowing, you may feel it in various places. But do not worry. Do not feel. This is known. Also as you acclimatize to that idea, you may get the impression that the energy has disappeared. It has not. Simply that when you do acclimatize to an energy, you may no longer feel it in the same way, or you are now used to it. And it is now comfortable. Again, we remind you that you never create any reality that you cannot handle. And therefore, when something like that happens, you may simply assume that it is the time you can't do it. It is the time before that idea that you have chosen to progress in that way and allow it to be a positive experience. Was it inherently an uncomfortable feeling? And we suggest if it is, it may be because of the judgment placed upon it simply instead of allowing it to occur and simply be experienced. Actually, it was extremely intense and I was kind of watching it from a distance on my arm. And I was enjoying it, but I looked at it with a little fear that I would also want you to think. I don't know how it would be. Always. You are getting your feet wet. You will never have to go any further than you already. If you do, put your foot in and wet it a bit. You can always pull it back. It is up to you. It is within your control. Simply that it will only appear uncomfortable if you think that it is extraneous rather than part of the process. Recognizing fully your creatorhood, your intention within those interactions. Is there anything else? Does this help? Thank you very much. Shitting. For sure. In my exploration of the energy centers throughout the body. One moment. And to you. Good day. And to you. It is a pleasure. We've studied much of the upper chocolates. Energy centers above the base of the spine. I have recently explored some of the lower centers in the lower part of the body. I've had some experiences with regard to them. Have you studied those? Do you know what they are? Do you have any information regarding those and how best to use them? In a sense, we do understand what you are saying. And again, there are many energy points throughout the body that you are not in a sense necessarily consciously aware of what you are saying. Very consciously aware of the lower ones generally have the purpose of what you label grounding. Therefore again allowing you to be firmly with your feet on the ground as your head do grow into the clouds. Does that answer the question? No. Can we further assist you in this matter? You can answer another question for me. Hold on. You just got the excitement. Follow your excitement. I guess I have some difficulty in determining or defining excitement. And here's my confusion. I've been prone to some psychic experiences. And to me that is an excitement of energy level or a higher vibration which I define as excitement. In a sense, yes. I also have that physical excitement of when something attracts me, I have a physical sensation. Alright, that is the physicalized translation of your excitement proxy. Then I also have that mental excitement when something in my mind appeals to me, I'll follow that also. Is it possible to confuse those excitements, if you will, the three that I've defined them possibly more? From our perspective you are simply separating those which are one thing. When we speak of excitement, there's not necessarily meaning. Every given situation of that, that is available to you that one of those opportunities will have you jumping up and down. Can be anywhere from preference to jumping up and down, anywhere in between. But it is all excitement. The idea of being again, that you are thinking within integrity, realization that you are part of everything, that is all one thing. Proceed. I guess that's difficult in that sense. Alright, may I ask you a question? Sure. Why do you choose to create this difficulty? Oh, I sure don't. But I experience it so I'm trying to work it out. Alright, but recognize if you experienced it, you are choosing to create it. By taking it back to that level, you will own it. You cannot change what you do not own. So again, I ask you to ask yourself, why are you choosing to create difficulty with that idea? How is it serving you to do so? Yeah, I haven't gotten used to that yet. Hold on. Simply again, be honest with yourself. Take the time, reflect, it will become again obvious. Do not look again for the most convoluted hidden answers. Maybe very obvious, very simple, but we will allow you to examine it and explore it. Is that a story? Yes. If not, please close the... No, that's fine. Oh, it's shitty. It is. It kind of led me into a question that I've been thinking about a little bit. Oh, right. I'm thinking within integrity. Now, is that a personal thing? I know that integrity of all that is. But it's like there are borderline things where people are saying, well, is that out of integrity or not? One moment. From our perspective, it is always 100% obvious. Simply that you play the game, will I choose to recognize it is obvious? Do you understand? Okay, another question is... Or do I really wish to function within integrity? Is it preventing me from doing something that I perceive I want to do? Okay, I can give an example of me. All right, I do. All right. Um... Death. Okay, say you're all a major corporation, a large amount of money, or a small amount of money, but you believe that. All right. Are you able to now pay it? No. Therefore, what will you now do? Not pay it. But say you're able to pay it if you work an extra job, or maybe some extra day, and do what doesn't excite you out of the things available to you right now, in order to operate within integrity. All right, we understand the question. That is one way, in a sense, to reconcile that situation. But it is not the way that we speak of. For again, remember, when functioning within your excitement, and we do not mean sporadically, we mean always, you will lead yourself into the opportunity to have as much abundance to do things and continue to do things that excite you with integrity. Therefore, those needs are met. Okay. A few more things about integrity. And one moment. One of the ways you have structured your society is with the idea of allowing death. Therefore, it is still within the agreed upon parameter. And as long as you know you are doing the best that you can within your excitement, you are within your integrity. As long as you are clear in tension, it is to fulfill your agreement you are within integrity. You say, as long as the intention is there to pay it, because you made that agreement, I mean you really have to have the intention to pay it. Yeah. One opportunity. Yeah. And many times in your society, individuals do not. What about, okay, in our society, there is a marriage between a man and a woman. Now, say the woman has an affair. Now, it is the person that she is having in a fair way, that they are operating within integrity. I mean, that is another question. Oh, right. And if they are feeling that they are really, they really believe that they are not doing anything wrong by doing that. Can someone else say to them, they are not operating within integrity? Can someone else choose to come on whether or not? Do you think someone else can provide very flexion and then the person can vent, see if that does ring through with them? But we perceive in a situation such as you have described the lack and a sense of integrity. It is not so much the idea of the act as the dishonesty, the withholding of the information of the act. For acting within integrity again, the recognition that everything is all one thing does not bring along with it, the idea that you would hide portions of yourself from other portions of yourself. Therefore, the idea of lying in a sense is representative of if you would like to put it that way, lack of it acting within integrity. Even if the women really don't personally know each other, I mean, there are cases of that. It's very common. Even just because, I mean, we are all part of all that is, then it is not. We are not sure the other side. I'm not really sure. Just try. Okay. Say, the wife and the other women have never even seen each other or met each other. It could still not be okay for the... The idea of that being lack and a sense of integrity is between the husband and the wife. We assume you mean the husband is not being honest with the wife about these ideas. Very much. Go on. Is it the responsibility of this other woman that he has to bear with even if she doesn't even know the wife? Her responsibility, in a sense, if you wish to put it that way, is the responsibility of all involved. Okay. And very often what you perceive to be the problem created from those situations does them from when these are initiating the lack of honesty. And very often these situations would not occur if the honesty was there. And certainly not in the tumultuous fashion that they do. You understand? Yeah. Yeah. You know, in my heart I felt that way, but you know, other people may operate in different ways. And sometimes it's really because of this. Hold on. And recognize your heart does not. Why? Therefore simply trust and validate what it gives you. Thank you, buddy. Jenny. I have a further question on integrity. Oh, right. Say an insurance company sent you a check for $202,000. And one moment. Okay. Did you ask this question? Or can you answer it yourself? I have thought about this tonight and I don't have the answer. Brosy. So an insurance company sent you a check for a couple thousand dollars and it's not for you. It's your name, but you did nothing to earn this check. Is that the universe sending you money or is that should that go back to the insurance company? May I ask you a question? Do you feel that this is honest? No, that is not. Thank you. Always is, you know. Simply that you do choose because you may put a part of the money to hide the honesty, the simplicity of it from its side. You use the words that you use once that you do not earn it. You have the preconceived idea. Well, in order to receive that, you have to work hard. No, I don't know if there's nothing on my head at all. But the idea of being not within the earning, but do you feel it is honest to cash that check? No, I don't. And I never did it, but my question thing is if you were specifically putting out this universe of you, you need this money and you want money, it also appears in your mailbox. Alright, so you have bank accounts. Again, the idea is honest. Okay. And because somebody does something, does not mean it is correct. And if you feel that that is okay within integrity, it's okay. Yes. Really? If you truly feel but we proceed, you do not. And you may play in a lab or a game of lying to yourself. It is not. But if you did truly believe it would be simply that we proceed, you do not. Alright. Shitty. For sure. You have told us that it's important that we see ourselves as equal to you for another civilization's other actions. In order to encourage face to face, if you could be more obedient of each other. Alright. Along with that idea of that you view everything as equal to yourself. Very in quantities, varying degrees of expansion. All equal, not simply you and us. So long. Speaking from our exposure and contact with changes so far, there are certain information that you know, the wisdom that you know. Alright, but again, degrees of expansion, quantity, if you will, has never and will never determine quality. We are speaking of quality, does not make us better, simply, more expanded, simply a different focus within physicality. What does that mean? I was going to say, I was going to use the word capability also, that at least I don't see that I certainly don't have them now. That I can say, hey, in every respect I am equal, let's say to some of the things you just played. And yet my question is, what? You are an equal being. May I ask you a question? Within your own quantity, you have two beings. One is very strong, one is physically very weak. Is one better than the other? It is that idea. Well, that is fact that how we are conditioned is what's bad, what's right, what's wrong. Alright, but we mean inherently better, and the answer from our perspective is no. Well, more and more, I see beauty, love, and equality within my fellow man. I'm now focusing now on how to get myself so that I can meet you face to face what guidance can you give me. You've already given me something just now, I guess. Hold on, but we also suggest you ask yourself why you feel the need to meet up face to face, or if it is a need instead of an excitement that in and of itself keeps us away. Your needing us has an underlying implication that you are not whole without us, and that is putting us in the sense above you and not looking at us as equals. But if you have that clear intention that it is your excitement and simply recognizing that anything that excites you, you deserve and will come to you and you proceed in each moment doing what excites you, you create the most conducive, atmospheric bubble to allow those communications. Again, not fixating upon that idea. That's helpful. The word be your idea of the was never in my thinking. Alright. We weren't suggesting that it was simply pointing out that individuals in your society seem from time to time to create it as a need. No civilization will come down to save you. You do not need safety. Therefore, many individuals in your society create that idea and they will be waiting a long time. Okay. Give them your hand. Alright. Continue. Yes. One moment. Be Southern. Have a speedy, speedy speech. Alright. Thank you very much. I've often wondered about you say good-day because then and we say good-day. That's a general thing we'd have to say good morning over and over and over. Good evening, my dear. Up here. Hold it. But generally, due to the fact that when it is night upon your planet, it is day upon mind, I will say and do you good-day. If it happens to coincide, that it is night, I will say and do you. Good evening. Right. Well, we recognize day as the whole day. The 24 hours here is. Hold it. We understand. Okay. Anyway. What I'd like to ask is a question about ego. Alright. Right. I recognize that ego, you've defined as that portion which keeps us focused in physical reality. Now, what is it in fact? Is it a portion of us or is it entities that we create or is it another entity or what it seems to act as an entity? In a sense, you may put it that way. But remember, you are all one being. It is your physical life representation of what keeps you focused. And its job is simply that to keep you focused. Unfortunately, within your society very often, you overload it with extra work. And that is when you get the negative effect that you do perceive to be negative ego. But by simply allowing it to only keep you focused and allowing yourself again to proceed in your excitement, in a sense gets absorbed within the totality of you. And you do not make the separation. Does that help? Yes, sort of. Alright. Please continue. You sound unsatisfied. Yeah. So what is it? I still have written, you really don't understand what it is. Have an ex like an entity like it's something other than what we are. In a sense, you may say that is the product of mind or mentality where your consciousness does cross physicality within the idea of your brain. In a sense, you do create that function and then label it as a separate entity or portion of yourself. But it is just one part representing the physical manifestation of your consciousness that keeps you focused. If that is not enough, point your question more specifically. Well, it's just that people go with that. There, ego. There's something other than what they are. Alright, again, part of the habitual ritual of making separations. Ego. Super ego. Id. Unconscious. Subconscious. Just all separations. All they are ideas. And in a sense, they are simply what you label them. But what we are saying is the function of that separation you have created is to keep you focused simply that. So it's like a mechanism we create? A mechanism you create that in a sense is physical but still has roots in the non-physical. If indeed you allow it to do its job rather than over lower it, shall we say? The apparent is that when you die, that portion is absorbed within you. So then you can say that it was also non-physical and not merely physical. For it does become a part of your overall higher self. Absorbed in a sense back into that idea. But it's not strictly the physical eyes of representation. So it is part of consciousness. Ego. Thank you. Thank you. You have another question? Not rather than other. Thank you. Shire. Sure. Yes. Hi. And do you? Good. I am. I have recently been reading the book which is exciting very much. Right. And after reading the book, I have experienced tremendous emotions within my book right here. In my heart. And I have not yet been able to decline for myself this feeling, these emotions, because sometimes I feel overwhelmed with love, but I am crying. And yet I feel overwhelmed with grief and I don't know if it's sorrow. So this is something that I know that I am working through in that I will learn for myself through either reflecting to you or others around me as I communicate about this. My understanding and I also am desires of a definition of what this emotion is. The idea of being that there are many forms of release. Right. One that you call crying, one that you call laughing, and another idea of crying in joy or ecstasy. You do create a release which is physically similar to the idea of your label crying when you are in pain or you could see that you are having difficulty. But it is all forms of physical life, release of energy, and does in a very real sense, sir, to, in but a moment's time, center you with your being, allowing you to see most strongly, emotionally, and tactfully how you feel and who you are. Again, ways to further define yourself. Okay. Yeah. Because I could not, I would go through this emotion and I would say, I can't define what this is because it was so strong. It was almost, it was overwhelming. And yet, I kept going back and reading the books. I mean, I couldn't put the book down because I wanted to experience more and more of what was coming through in the book. And I thought, well, in time, I will understand what this is. And of course, did not you reflect it to me? It was pretty likely what it has been for me in that. That also leads me to another question of, I see a situation come up in my life and I look at it and I say, how does this serve me? This is a learning lesson. And sometimes it may be months before I understand what it is that I went through. How long? Generally not put sometimes. No, sometimes. And sometimes I can have a learning lesson and instantly understand it. Also, the idea of lessons as you put it. That you can immediately glean some idea from and months later you will find other ideas from. But again, we have said at the beginning of this interaction, in general, you can immediately glean something. And again, that something is most obvious. What is it immediately allowed me to do? It is generally most obvious and you overlook it because again of the tendency to view and look forward the complexity in a situation. You are right. Keep it simple. Yeah. Okay. I got it. Thank you. That is my question. Sure. Any? I have another question. All right. Right. I have been discussing with the channel the technology of water. Okay. Water as a fuel. Do you have access to this channel? E. Okay. Can you maybe enlighten us a little bit on this and your view of this technology? Is it possible that we can use this as an alternative fuel the way it is conceptualized? And how do you say it the best that we start to implement this? From our perspective, from what you have described, things are moving most appropriately as is. This is a viable idea. We have spoke of it before, although not in detail, for we allow individuals in your society to open their own gifts, make their own discoveries. But that, along with your ideas of solar and along with your ideas of electromagnetic harnessing, if you will, are some very strong alternatives that will allow you to utilize in your planet most maximally your resources in a non-gluing way to have that which you need. And overcoming what you have perceived to be the barriers will be a growing, learning experience which will enable much integration, much acceleration upon your planet. And as individuals do, in a sense, in their minds, turn over about these ideas one by one as you have also discussed, the idea of games momenting within the mass consciousness, till it becomes shall we say overwhelming reaches a particular threshold and manifest. We do perceive that this idea may be near with what you are speaking of. And it is a very worthwhile project for again. We are talking about no waste. We are talking about working with and not, if you will, against your planet. As you do realize the sentient being that of your planet and treat it with the respect that you would treat any sentient being with or anything in creation, for that matter, you will get the reciprocation from the planet. Yes, we recognize this and this is one of the reasons, of course, we are pursuing it. Also, there is another aspect to that thing on the view which is something quite different than I have never heard this mention before. It is the idea of using a gas as a magnetic particle to where this gentleman was describing to me that he has created, if you like, a magnetic gas which is composed of argon and ion, ionized ion. And he says he is developing a way which can be used to magnetize and de-magnetize and thereby creating electromagnetic fields and by using very small amounts of power can then generate, by putting coils around this, that can generate electricity in vast quantities. Very good. It is a very valid idea and falls within the electromagnetic car, the thing that we spoke of, one of the many options available to you, very creative. Yes, and he has gone a step further and said that by putting this magnetic gas in a tube, a substance of a tube being non-magnetic itself and pulsing laser lights really can cause it to magnetize and de-magnetize. Very good. And thanks. It is just a matter of size, how big you may get, even if it is in our whole city, or we could have individual ones for its health, health, etc. Very good. And it only takes literally only maybe 10 or 15 watts to run it. Very good. We are very excited about this idea. It is quite viable. We suggest, however, a way in which you may serve within this situation is as follows. Share with the individual involved your perspective on field. For there is very much of the idea within the mentality of many of those involved in these projects, of their possibility of being suppressed. There, shall we say, ability to attract, attract that suppression will lie in their fear factor. If those individuals are made aware that fear simply means you find that scenario to be most likely, that simple little bit of information can allow them to shift away from feeling in that situation, then they will not require protection. They will not require bodyguards. For there is nothing to protect yourself from. And remember, when you do feel the need for protection, when you do initiate protection, you are setting up the attack. And by allowing those individuals to understand that, you can be a great servant at a very crucial timing within this idea. Do you understand? Yes, I know. Thank you. That is a very valid aspect on it because he does have protection. Very good. Like he said, he says to angels, so it's quite interesting. And it very well may be that that symbol will be adequate. But if you can go a step further and allow that individual to understand what we have said, you may be of most service and you may find, coincidentally, that one of the reasons for your interacting is that that individual will understand this idea. It simply needs to be introduced. Very simple. He has expressed his reluctance to accept family as a valid tool. His alright. What we have always said is not that you must believe who we are. Simply that the information is valid and stands on its own. When presenting to individuals any of this information, you do not have to include where it has come from in your opinion unless you find it most appropriate. The information itself is what is key. And we suggest to deliver it in any way that will allow an individual to hold and look at and examine the information for what it is without stipulation. Okay, so if I present that idea to him, he may ask me, okay, have you not established? Have you not worked? Who else would I have to make? And he may cognize immediately that that makes sense. For very often much of this information simply makes sense. Simply rings true with individuals. And again, it is no accident that you are attracted to each other. Therefore assume that any individual within your reality, any individual who you have come in contact with is for a most perfect, synchronic, six reasons. And again, don't get hooked on the results. Don't have an expectation that you must take it in a certain way. Simply recognize that you are there for your reasons and reflect who you are. It will do the greatest good, which may or may not be what you expect. So again, don't get hooked on the results. Simply reflect and allow individuals the opportunity to interact with that information. For they have attracted it to them. And you will make it most tolerable. However, that is appropriate. Yes, yes. I sort of looked at that and thought, yes, it's always worked this way. When you truly yourself, be yourself, enacted activity and be willing to stand up and encounter this award. Then it comes off, hold on. You show that confidence and you show that willingness to be there. And how you feel about our energy should you choose to introduce that idea is a very positive feeling, a very positive idea. So do not assume, take responsibility for, is reaction. Simply feel it out and do what you, being the vibration of who you are, are most comfortable with. You will know what is the pro-3. You will know what rings true to you. Thank you. Okay, thank you. Then it will be by. If you moment left, do this interaction. Sh Sure. Amen. I do it. There was a tape you did a while ago and it was also, it was done in, like, technically, magazine. It was a timeline, like the 1991, 1992, 1993, agenda. And, you know, powerful. The energy is a little furthering on the years ago. Yes, remember, a prediction is simply a sensing from the now moment, which changes all the time as to what is most likely at that moment. Yes, what I wanted you to do is do an update in terms of now compared to that. Is there a, you know, thing that would include that is up for those, you know, that actually right here started on a nice, nice, wonderful year? In a sense, what we are able to perceive, due to the current acceleration, is that there will be much acceleration, again, implementation, and exploration in this year, your 1991. It seems, most likely, at this juncture that your 1992 year will, shall we say, present in a larger way through your media the idea of our existence. You will see more of that idea and it could be that something that you may consider or many may consider for that will always be some who will choose to perceive another reality. Irrefutable evidence of saying, your 1993 year, which we have labeled the year that you may wish to get your excitement in mode by, is simply a symbol, simply in a sense of motivation from our perspective, or we perceive many individuals choose to hear that type of thing. It is not necessarily that it is etched in stone, etched in steel, but in a sense, certain gates of energy are available during certain timing, and that is a most conducive timing for those of you who have initiated these ideas, shall we say, get moving. We are encouraging action. Well, I know I have a tendency to work better under that line. Or that idea, thank you. I have one of the silly questions. Oh, right. I think so. Just a lot of fun. I know, what is it, it seems to you like? Much the same as yours. Maybe what you would consider a slight more leathery. Leathery really. Slides, slides. Softener than you might imagine. But a slight bit of rougher, shall we say, than yours? Oh, okay. So I would have thought it was a bit of a getaway. What you may find a bit surprising is what you would consider to be our lips on white socks. Oh, yeah. Okay. Let's try them out, Mary. I love this. All right. We are very willing to kiss you when we do meet face to face. But recognize we have met within your dream reality. Simply that as of this point, it has not served you to bring back that idea for specific reasons which will unfold. Okay. No, for sure. Eight. And you have been very busy. I guess I have. And I acknowledge and take Mary first when we are underscoring the acceleration that is ongoing in 1991. As you started your dialogue, it was deja vu for me because the face came before me and I recall the conversation that I had with you in the flesh. Just this morning of my time. It was quite interesting to have all that validated and ironically enough, I had had this whole conversation with Robert before we came here. I'm the same discourse that you had put forth this evening. Hold on. Nothing is an accident. It's all called incidents happening at the same time. Very interesting that all of those channels were opening simultaneously, of course, scientifically. And recognize this idea. We have been very active in interacting with you in your dream reality. Everybody in this room. And in the head. I will tell you this. You will begin soon to bring back the memory of these interactions. I have to say over the course of the past few weeks, I have brought back to my waking daily life. The pieces of recall. And my question to you is after this build up is, does Amma have anything that she would like to share this evening because I really do feel a very close connection to her as well. And I feel like I can hear. All I heard. Prose me. Well, as we have said, you have very strong and clear agreement with this being. We chatteled the entity in a sense allowed the physiological channel to channel Amma in an evening when you were not present. However, you are now. Prose me. Will you validate what you get? Oh, I am. You know, it's like, can I have such an extreme validation? I feel like everything is such an awakening. And when you didn't just, you know, began and was on everything, but I do. I think you can have it. I'm bad. We have said this is the year of implementation and inspiration. You are becoming inspired. I am still. And we have discussed with you, if you recall, within your last weekend, get away, the idea of your feeling that you would lose in a sense. And that if you did allow that to occur rather than preventing it, that this type of communication would be available with Amma. But simply, we do not wish in a sense to take that from you. But you are incapable. Do you wish to do that? Cute. Hold on. If you say so. We have no sword in hand. The only staff that we carry is that of unconditional love. Thank you, buddy. Do you wish to communicate at this time? Or would you like this chew on it? I am still working on the show. Hold on. When will you play? And when will you understand you already have total trust? I do. If I should play quite often, being able to integrate all of the aspects and the perspective and the reality. Hold on. We again say to you, relax. Breathe. Allow. One, two, three. There you go. It is that simple if you allow it to be. That is all there is to it. You can take as many steps as it will take for you to feel comfortable that you have done enough work in this regard. Or you can relax, play, and instead of forcing instead of making allow that, which is most natural to you. And incidentally, what you have already done for this group? Well, you know, I think it was wonderful that Trevor asked this question about ego because I think that is a very big restraint from the eye. I see a lot of perspectives coming in and very hard to integrate all of them. I think I have that fear of how will it affect my life and what will change and how will it affect my life. How will my ego be affected by all of this? And I'm not, you know, may I ask you a question? Do you see a vast negative effect on the life of the physiological channel? I've had some problems with the effects that I'm being, but I feel the strength and responsibility to other people. All right. For them is what you are saying, though. Simply be responsible to them by being who you are and you will find those details will fall into place. You have not attracted these individuals to you by accident. I can integrate all of that intellectually, but I'm fine. All right. But one moment of recognizing. The conception is the same as knowing the idea. It's simply that you mentally create that it is removed. It is not. There is no process necessary. The conception is the entourage. And I would like to reflect to you that in one of my introspective moments, one of my New Year's resolutions, it just kind of popped out. It wasn't pre-meditated, popped out. And I wasn't going to hide myself from myself, which I thought was a very superficial statement, but the more that I got to think about it, the more profound it seemed to be. There is no more interpersonal, how you seek? You're not going to do it. Do not need to do that anymore. Twenty-five thousand years, we would think. You've done it. I know. It's such a simple statement. All right. But it is that simple. Again, everything can be. There is complexity. There is richness. There is challenge. But it is that simple to implement. And this is a year two implement. If you allow yourself to implement your ideas now, that is the most conducive, electromagnetic atmosphere to allow instance manifestation of ideas. If you do act against your grave, you will very quickly be again, shall we say, this appointment. You will find it again. And this was the 1993 incentive, if you will, that you will find it most difficult to do increasingly more difficult to do that, which does not excite you. The reason being, because now that you are in possession of this knowledge, you are not willing to settle for less. And that is what you do when you do that. You are settling for less than who you are. And in a sense, you may call that a type of conscious suicide. True. Hold on. So live who you are. Do not stifle yourself. Your pain will go away. Your problem will be situations that you do allow to transform. You will take it all back in. Own it. Transform it to that, which you do prefer. If you think that sounds good, it is because it is good. It is a lot of fun. It is possible. And as soon as you are willing to let go of the notion that you must balance your happiness with misery, you will not manifest misery. You may perceive in others from time to time ideas you may label negative, but you will not expedience them. By being as great as you will become infinitely more aware of everything, things you label positive and negative. But the idea is you will only manifest. You will only expedience that which you label positive. And the key again being by not just making it neutral to cope with it, to make it so that you can deal with it. But by taking it the next step into how does this serve me? Everything you experience serves you. And when you say it does not, you are not allowing it to do so. And you are the one who are not allowing it. And any time you may, even if you become quite good, quite proficient at not allowing it, you can allow it like that. Any time you desire simply because you say so. All right? All right. Recognize hope and find doubt, but we know what you mean. And on that note, we wish to express to you our love and appreciation for your willingness to begin to look at who you actually chose to be. For as you do, you do become who it is that you truly are. And that is the only you we will ever meet. We thank you for your willingness to begin to integrate, to begin to view portions of your consciousness that you have hidden from yourself for a fear to look at. If you do detect for a while an increase in ideas of fear, simply recognize you are beginning to look at the deepest things that you have locked away. This is integration. You can take all these ideas and glean positive effects from them, from anything, or you would not have attracted it into your own. Well, I would just like to thank the group for putting forth a form where I'm able to do perspectives that maybe would not have been brought forth. And I acknowledge you and thank you for that and all of your support and everything you're saying. I totally validate. As do we and we thank you again for your willingness to become honest. And my next step is in validating my in comma. Validating in validating myself. I have to work on that crazyology. And I know I'm working on it. I wish I could say it is, but I still have to work in the states. But again, recognize your work is liberal. You may now begin to experience a fourth density concept play as a child, as open as a child, as willing to be who they truly are with no doubt as a child. That is channeling. However, you are now beginning to channel yourself without doubt in love and life. We wish upon ending this interaction to entirely happy new years. For that symbol, this year, Vyorta will be very strong. We wish to you exciting dreamwise and life dream. For it is all one dream. You are dreaming right now. Wake up and will the dream. We bid you a most fond, happy-woven. For these. Happy New Day. Good night. Good night.
