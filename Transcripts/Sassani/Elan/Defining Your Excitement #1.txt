 All right, I'll say, how are you all this evening of your time as you create time to exist? Great, thank you very much. Thank you very much. Allow us to begin this interaction, this evening of your time of the entitlement, defining your excitement. Before we begin, allow us to once again remind you that from our perspective, the emotional vibration you label excitement is an indication of what many in your society often inquire about your purpose in life. When asked what is your purpose in life, one of the things that we share is that you have a constant indication of your purpose, both overall and in each and every given moment. That is your excitement. Excitement is the vibratory energy, the emotion that results from your higher self rendering in a sense to your physical self, your purpose, the reason you feel excited, you feel moved is because that is your indication that that particular idea or event rings true for you. And by beginning to look at the ideas that excite you, you can begin to determine your purposes, again both overall, the thing that excites you the most and in every given moment from what is available in that moment with integrity choosing from those options using your excitement. Your willingness to follow your excitement in action is the ultimate validation of information from your higher self, the information of your purposes. One of the ideas that we encounter when interacting with your society is that certain things which excite individuals are societally believed to be unworthy or perhaps everyone knows you shouldn't do that type of approach and therefore individuals from time to time will ignore what excites them for again everybody knows that's no way to make a living. But the idea is that you always know, always know if you will let yourself in on the knowledge what excites you. Or you can begin to act upon what excites you in action as we have also explained is the ultimate and by product that allows you to manifest reality in a physical world. You by definition need define what excites you. Therefore allow us to simply suggest that you do begin to run through your excitement meter the things present in your life for you will see that some of them excite you some of them do not and begin to get an indication of where perhaps you may wish to focus your attention and what will be most fruitful if followed through for because the excitement is your indication of purpose it brings along with it certain shall we say built in benefits it brings along with it the idea of providing from the universe from all that is all the support necessary to continue to do the exciting thing and that support may come in many forms but because that support is provided that exciting thing becomes most effortless to do understand that it is truly most effortless to be the truest you you can be where the effort comes in where the fatigue comes in is living up to someone else is expectation of who it is you quote unquote should be from our perspective there are no should and you are your own greatest own greatest one that has the ability to determine who you are and what is true for you no one else in that sense including us can tell you who you are perhaps individuals can reflect back to you certain ideas that when you interpret them will help you to define yourself still further but in a sense that is the externalization in viewing those external symbols of what you truly contain within and you do contain it you know what it is that excites you perhaps you have been taught out of it but if you will simply begin to be honest with yourself you all know what it is therefore our simple suggestion would be to begin to pay attention to those definitions one simple formula that we have shared from time to time with your society contains three phases of awareness these phases of awareness help you to define what it is that excites you in a very precise way we have shared this before and will be brief but simply this will allow you to hone in on your excitement the first phase of awareness is clear intention what is it that you intend what is it that you wish to manifest the overall intention itself by beginning to allow yourself to glean what it is is the first phase of awareness the first step toward defining your excitement the second phase comes in three portions clear definition clear desire and clear deserved ability 3d clear definition can be how you can begin to go about doing the things that excite you but it is also the category of what definitions you hold your beliefs and what definitions would need being by definition necessary to do the things that excite you you can see if the definitions you have and the definitions you need would match if they don't that gives you the opportunity to transform the definitions that you have into the ones that would be most conducive to allow you to follow through with your excitement so your definitions are important both in the aspect of what they already are and what definitions would allow you more effortlessly to move according to your excitement clear desire is the emotional component involved in the clarity in the defining of your excitement for emotion energy motion is the aspect of your energy is the aspect of the three sided prism of your personality that activates shall we say your consciousness to allow you to most conclusively act which we will get clear deserved ability is another clarifying issue that allows you to see it perhaps you have built into your definitions some shall we say stoppers or blocks for the idea is very often individuals do not acknowledge their connection to all that is and when they do not acknowledge that direct connection that you are a direct expression of all that is the notion comes up of not deserving not deserving existence or perhaps if you do deserve existence not deserving what you would desire within existence from our perspective your deserve ability is an inherent given you need not have done anything in particular in order to deserve to exist you simply exist and along with it have the deserve ability to both have excitement have desires but also deserve to allow yourself to fulfill these desires so therefore if you find yourself bumping up against a particular wall one of the things that may be most helpful is to look at the fact of do you truly feel you deserve the thing that excites you and if you do not look at that issue for again overall from our perspective you do deserve it but if you believe that you don't that is an opportunity if you believe that you don't know one of the advantages of knowing that is you can change it and you can begin to grant yourself deserve ability nurture your deserve ability and realize that your primary relationship in life is with yourself your ability to do anything externally will only in that sense be a reflection of your willingness to do so internally so therefore your willingness to love in that sense yourself unconditionally will be reflected in your ability to love others unconditionally your ability to see judging yourself will allow you to see the judgment of others and so forth so therefore deserve ability can be a prime clarifying issue and again from our perspective even if you do not believe you deserve we know that you do lastly and finally the shall we say phase of awareness that directly results in the manifestation of your particular reality is clear action you are within a physical world at least right now this is your chosen focus at least for the time being as you create time as a part of this focus and the physicalized movement of your physicalized body is the thing that actually creates the reality your actions always result your style of action your approach of action always results from your beliefs so the cause of causes will be your belief systems but the actual mechanism that rings in the reality and allows it to change and transform is the action so your willingness not only to define what it is that excites you but to act upon it once you have defined it is the set of parameters that will allow you most conducibly to create the reality you say you prefer therefore begin to pay particular attention to what excites you and as well particular attention to that which does not the reason being as you are moving through an energetic gate a conductive gate that allows the conducive atmosphere for your positive transformation as we have recently shared two things occur the things that excite you and therefore are representative of who you are become most effortless most simple one exciting thing leads to the next however it is just as unconducible to continue to do the things which do not excite you and you will find as well as it is easy to begin to do the things that are representative of who you are you will find it a bit more difficult to sustain for any period of time doing of the things that are reflective of who you are not and the bottom line is you may find them falling apart far more quickly but again the good news is if you are willing to follow your inner excitement that will culminate most quickly as well so therefore you have a bit of incentive to establish to find your excitement and begin to move therefore allow us to move on to the interaction before we do allow us to thank you all once again for your willingness to continually interact with us in this format allow us to thank the individuals responsible for the procurement of the space within which we are sitting for again that does us a great service as well as you before we begin the interaction allow us to also share with you that though the transformation of perhaps this space itself seems like an ending do understand from our perspective it is just as much a new beginning have a good time for there are some surprises around the corner and when something ends which seems near and dear to your heart it may at first seem like an interruption but in fact it is solidly part of the past and the joy that seems in that sense to be ceasing is simply representative of the degree of joy yet to come so therefore get excited again allow us to thank you and express our appreciation for your willingness to be diplomats from your society we ask you now how may we be of service to you and understand you may refer to the blending of consciousness before you by either Bashar or Allah either will do and we thank you she is i know you speak sometimes about timing how can we overcome my own block on timing well the idea is there is nothing to overcome timing in and of itself as well as excitement is part of the indication itself if you allow the circumstances to show you exactly what is most conducive to do right now timing simply becomes an unfoldment if you look at what is truly in front of you in any given moment rather than what you wish was there but isn't you can begin to realize that each moment contains within it its own advantage and again timing by convention then simply becomes the unfoldment which is by the way in this physical reality the fun part does that help but the idea is overcoming is not necessary you cannot overcome yourself and that implies a controlling a forcing the idea of the utilization of timing occurs through the facility of allowance so simply allow the timing to be what it is and trust in that timing if there are for instance two things which excite you exactly equal with integrity then the aspect of timing comes into it to allow you to indicate which is the ones to choose for one will be more accessible at that time than the other and you can use that timing in and of itself as an indication of which to choose so you can use your timing the other thing is from our perspective there is no such thing as a block per se simply perhaps that something occurs that was not what you expected and if you labor it a block you will create the effect of a block but if you simply say well i thought i was going to go in a particular direction obviously the circumstances are telling me that it will be a bit of a different path than i expected but realize that that path will have with it just as much joy you can recognize that what you have formally labeled blocks or simply detour signs does that make sense yes one other question when we had this private session you were said um i was going to meet an old old friend yes and i was wondering the timing on that are they around already and i'm just not seeing it or is there still our perception is that this idea will occur within from the sensing of the energy right now within the first six months of your next year again we refrain from predicting for there is no such thing as a prediction of the future but our sensing of the momentum of the energy right now would seem to indicate that have you not however met up with another particular individual fairly recently see i'm not sure i'm not recognizing it i may not be recognizing look at it and perhaps what we are saying will be more apparent but what we were speaking of has not yet occurred um one other question oh your self or your people i guess do you know all of the events that are going to happen in your life no and part of the joy of our particular existence is as well the timing the unfoldment therefore again what is unexpected to us is a lot of fun or one thing we know is that when you begin to understand positive synchronicity no matter what it is unexpected or expected it is always full of joy and the idea of surprise is the particular advantage of this style of consciousness whereby you limit your awareness of the totality of all your knowledge when you know it all there is nothing to learn a new nothing to discover no surprise so therefore we retain while we also are physical which by the way those days are numbered but we retain that idea that symbol for again it is a lot of fun when you just said did i meet someone i just remembered one thing um did you mean mind you boss or is it mind you boss in addition to the other yes yes that's what i thought okay there are connections which will in that sense become more obvious as time goes on i think and am i right my this new boss will be real good experience oh yes did you ask okay good thank you i love to you it's a lot green screen as do you greetings as well i think the cross of the matter is deserved really at least from my present point all right the crux do proceed all right now is your point of view it's a german that each of us is the all that is now from our point of view that's a big question mark all right if you say so perhaps in some individuals instances but do proceed okay so look across the main idea i think in terms of speeding evolution personal illusion it's full realization of the god within do you have any suggestions as to how to um accelerate that realization um the all that is oh yes by fulfilling your purpose by defining your excitement and with integrity acting upon it that is acting as though you are all that is it is that simple if you wish we can drum up a complicated process but the idea is that it's truly that simple that is acting like a conscious creator which is one of your strongest definitions of all that is so to act then as the conscious creative more conscious we are defined your excitement and validate it and the ultimate validity of any idea is your willingness to apply it your willingness to walk it your willingness to act as though that is who you are with conviction boldly where no man's sort of speak or woman has gone before oh i'm citing and how it's celery for the idea is you always are and you are utilizing your great power as an expression of all that is to even be able to convince yourself momentarily that you are not so therefore it takes shall we say quite a bit of that power to even have that awareness thank thank you a lot may i share with you a um a poem that i wrote recently with regard to this new ship thank you it's called a postcard from god today i received a postcard from god honor was a picture of myself reading the postcard the message read having a wonderful time wish you were here all right no need to wish simply you are there be there and when you remain grounded in the moment accepting the timing of each moment you already are there very cute my my dad that you share with us perhaps in a brief poem or remark states sentiment in your ancient language in a future of interaction in our language however one moment we will keep it simple and brief live now that's how and your willingness to act is the full expression of living and to you as well sharing is i want to thank you for what you spoke to me at the end of the discussion here in the evening and i want to pass on to you that i am truly excited about the changes and thank you for your sharing over the past year which has helped me to come to that point and learn to follow my advice thank you for your willingness to follow it for whatever we are saying is quite inconsequential as to what you choose to do so ultimately it was up to you you made the decision you did all the work or the play therefore thank you as well and again thank you for your willingness to allow particular indicators within your reality to not be blocked but simply roads on pointing and perhaps an unexpected direction within which there will be the unfoldment of a particular idea which will be as powerful as this idea oh right have a good time thank you is that all that's all shit that's sure it's reading reading reading to elantu and great i understand that getting a bit crowded in the counterpart on board also and is she different from animal yes does she have a name not yet okay i am well there will be some direct communications from that particular individual next year of your time from time to time for specific reasons within specific times i understand from previous discussions that we as a group consciousness found a planet and a personal vehicle that was appropriate for the exploration we wanted to have and when we infused consciousness with the eight type vehicle what i'm wondering is what consciousness was already there and where did it go oh first of all realize that that description in and of itself is quite colloquial however it will do as a single second of all realize in a sense that nothing is lost there is simply a changing of the guard so to speak idea but the idea is that the previous style of consciousness would be what you might label second density consciousness more along the lines of the animals upon your planet without the idea so much of self-reflection does that ask where did they go or shall we say a transformation from their perspective they went nowhere and in the sense as you have said simply entered an alternate reality if we're everything simultaneously everywhere are am i for instance animal consciousness somewhere maybe in another octave or in a sense you may say you recapitulated through much of that idea though not in a linear fashion and again remember from our perspective animal consciousness are reflective aspects of your own consciousness so yes um also i i remember hearing on a tape that um the our waking reality our dream reality forms the template for our waking reality is that true there is the idea within what you would call your sleeping dream reality on a level that you consider to be quite unconscious to blueprint this waking dream reality you do not maintain the awareness that you have done so and then from time to time when you are within this waking dream you do have a notion that you have blueprinted that phenomenon is labeled deja vu and the shall we say mystical result result in feeling that individuals have when experiencing a deja vu is beginning to infringe on the idea of simultaneous existence for at the moment you are experiencing the deja vu you are literally occupying both faces simultaneous okay i lately have been dreaming very vividly about things that have happened the day before holler pre-cognitive ideas sometimes they will be more obvious in that way also i had a dream by the way the separation of the sleeping dream and the waking dream is the type of idea that will begin to fade as you begin to live this dream as you begin to realize the possibilities and the potentials exist that are in that reality within this reality when you begin to live this dream there will no longer be the need for the separation of the two ideas when you begin to get close to living this dream sometimes there seems to be more of an obvious bleed through from one reality to another and one of the other corresponding results is in the visuals will find themselves saying well did i dream that or did it happen i've been having that happen a lot all right you are beginning in that sense to eradicate the line between the two congratulations one night i was very very vividly and intensely writing a letter to you what if you ever got it oh yes there was some postage due but we forget i have one other question by the way those styles of communications are received by us perhaps in my daily day-to-day life not consciously in a portion shall we say that you might label loosely we do not so much have this idea but loosely unconscious and then when i would need to know it it would simply be there it is a fragment in that sense of my consciousness and when we recede from these interactions allowing a land to be more or less the front guide then there will still be that fragment of my consciousness went so to speak to these interactions so i will still in that sense be in touch good i have one other question do you mostly i'm disappointed that oh nothing yeah but nothing happens when i try and use the Ouija board will all run what everyone you do the appointing you also do the this appointing it's up to you but perhaps you have more of a direct line and do not need the conduit if in that sense so you find that it would be much fun and excites you on some level then simply continue to do it and perhaps you will find it more conducive to do so with another individual yeah okay then it would be another co-creation okay i've wanted to wish you spent two billion all right perhaps your other is available i should try to read my house and that would be fun there are no shoes but you may have a good time all right sure thank you very much for showing and you know shitty for sure please uh when you recede from these channeling sessions will you be channeling through other places or where will you go what will you do as we have stated only through three individuals in full shall we say for them dadal anca i have co a woman from japan who speaks japanese by the way therefore it is translated to japanese and a third individual who we consider to be as sentient as the other two a dolphin where will that occur the dolphin's day is dreamer and swims in the pacific vase between yore new ziranda area and hawaiian islands well that sounds truly excited how do you feel about that truly excited so that means that jump right in there the dumice generally dreamer through dreamer to the other dolphins in advance and also therefore a particular availability arises to you man willing to channel the dolphin okay so through dreamer through through contacting dreamer channeling dreamer we have access to your energy shall we say you already have more of a direct line but that would be one way if you wish a party well we wish you lost some fun with this hope i knew that much no need to wish we already have it but we thank you for the sentiment is that all how about you well i could share an experience that last night well we do why and then following it's really fun and Alicia our cat with kind of none of the love nice name uh the shark name the cat it leavesing just one end you did the name yeah we don't call it all the time i don't know if you have still on the date but um she she was up against my leg started purring and it was such an experience the unconditional love and um as i was thinking of that i thought of you and your society and how you talk about having the experience of living on the background of allowable release is part of the interaction take your time the purring just represented me that i conditioned love and that connection with all that is and i truly felt how it must be here a total global planetary unconditional love and it's like planetary purring oh that would be that in a sense is a very appropriate analogy yeah it is in a sense that you could say that were you to monitor the overall vibration of our planet loosely seeking you would get that type of purring idea yes yeah i sense it very strongly apparently so look forward to our old planetary purring all right may i make a suggestion but not to look forward to that well that's one idea but also if you will allow yourself to purr now and again you will begin to form a nucleus around which others will purr with you yeah that was the other reflexive is that individually having that experience of purring with others all of that sense of connectedness when thanking for your allowance of the sometimes seemingly overwhelming shall we say effects of unconditional love and we thank you is that all thank you shed yes is your preparation for your current work or play as a social engineer what source of things did you learn or in other words what really courses in your curriculum the idea is we have no rigidized structure of courses per se simply whatever within my particular life excited me i validated it acted upon it and it brought with it not only the results but all the knowledge resources and tools necessary to then begin to do the other things which excite me and this again has to do with timing being perfect as in a sense things occur along a timeline according to a particular timing one of the reasons that sometimes within this style of reality something doesn't occur exactly when you intend or shall we say expect rigidly that it will is because there are certain things to be learned certain resources to be green certain knowledge that will facilitate the full enjoyment and manifestation of the thing you say you designed so if a particular timing seems to be a little bit slower than perhaps you would have expected the idea is that you are gaining much of the knowledge and tools to be able to appreciate and without the thing that excites you and trust in this mechanism will allow you to have a more placid frame of mind along the way but simply i attracted whatever individuals would facilitate me in that way and perhaps i would not give myself so much the title of social engineering as a social sharer thank you that that answered my the intention behind the question as well as the question thank you for having a clear enough intention for us to pick up upon i'm i've become very excited about your species communications well all right and i have a speeding suspicion always nature that uh that your play with the dolphins is part of the paper project by which uh we in the citations will be in full communication before too long well the idea is that the first alien species you are most likely to communicate with is in your own backyard this is shall we say a bit of a unique arrangement whereby and again we have shared this idea when extra so to speak terrestrial entities or societies scan your planet for intelligent life we come up with two distinct species not one and therefore this is rather unique there is also because of the willingness and openness of the dolphin consciousness from time to time the shall we say exporting of those particular entities to other societies so therefore at this time upon our planet there are some dolphins in our waters that have come from your planet by the way quite willingly as well as upon our mothercraft so we also interact with them directly you as a society are beginning to acknowledge their sentient nest and as you do you will give yourself the opportunity to interact with them more directly but a suggestion from our perspective would be to begin to understand that the mechanism for the telempathy between you will be quite emotional so you need not hide your feelings when interacting with them and it is through those very feelings and the allowance of the expression of the emotion that it becomes most conducive for that style of communication thank you it is the you answered my second another question with regard to that too and that is the the specific nature of language by which we communicate would be emotional at first they do have what you might label vocalizations though the range of their vocalizations extends a bit below and above what you would consider to be your limits of perception so there is only shall we say a midsection that you would communicate with and perhaps some of the difficulty thus far in the translation would be for those aspects which surpass your particular level or range of perception with with their certain concepts that well this way could be learned through you what they mean by certain sounds from time to time this could occur but in that sense you will find it more conducive to interact directly ask them the idea is they are quite intelligent and can answer you also understand the spirit so to speak of their civilization is the idea of flowing and ecstatic joy so therefore they maintain throughout their lives what you might label in your particular reality the inner child that playfulness that fascination that childlike fascination is continual your willingness to express that aspect of yourself will be one of the first meaning grounds as well so therefore swim play with them that will be the beginnings of the interaction the mere physical eyes coexistence thank thank you very much and to you shed the star is i have a personalized question to ask you about my mother she's been sick for about a year now all right divine well it started with um from her childhood she was she asked a number of sisters in her family and they always used to tell that she never looked the right way or this was never right why or she she was a peasant or she wasn't she was never up to their standards and um it was almost like uh that there was like a fictional movie i guess years ago when you had Cinderella and the you know the right slipper on the foot and the other two sisters are going to the ball but this one sister she was always never any good compared to the other two sisters well that's when my mother had been treated by her sisters and she's been going through a mental emotional situation where she is on medication now to try to balance herself and it's been going on for over a year and it's really hard it's not easy to try to you try to comfort her in a way of making her feel that she's going to be all right and she cries quite a bit and then there are days when she feels good and um i've talked to you about this before but not totally the full story and i'm wondering will there ever be an end to what i consider the pain that she's going through the idea is no accident that at the beginning of this interaction we discussed issues of deserved ability it is not so much that the sisters rendered these concepts to her it is that she accepted those particular renderings and bought into them herself there was nothing inherently true about them but she was willing on some level to agree with those assessments therefore you can point out to her many of the ideas we have shared about deserved ability and about choosing to buy into the reality of others versus the reality that feels right to herself if she were to look at in that way the idea of how she feels about herself she will find she agrees with many of these ideas and you can begin to have a dialogue with her about why she would believe that what is the opposite belief and begin to point out that there is an equality in both beliefs and she can choose either she has just convinced herself on a level that she could only choose one but first of all pointed out to her as a choice i'll be perhaps at that time unconscious you're pointing it out to her makes it conscious and then begin to discuss the alternate viewpoint the alternate self-validation and again it always draws back to defining your excitement even in that case if she will begin to look at what excites her and granted validity much of the attention will stray and again another aspect of excitement is that it also tells you by the very virtue of the fact that you are excited about it that you are infinitely capable to do that thing it is the prerequisite it is all unique if it excites you you contain the ability to manifest it discuss these ideas and begin in that sense to allow her to define her excitement no accident that that was the title of this interaction once she gets very excited about a lot of things she feels a lot of things in washington on a political and social level with people and she has a lot of ability to do things but then she gets into this other person which is the depression the depressed person and and you try to give her a lot of you know verbal love just do it to her and and it helps a little bit but then she's still revert one day she's fine and the next day she's not and and is there ever going to be an end to the process of what she's going through it have you ever shared with her our definition of depression and do you know it yourself i'm not so least right there all right then allow us in that sense to share this idea the effect that you label depression results from the judgment of a natural state of mind which you may label self reflection or self meditation individuals create it all everything sources so to speak from the internalness the center of your being therefore one most all answers truly do lie within you create external reflections to allow yourself to validate those answers but they lie within individuals ultimately get to the point where they understand at least unconsciously that they will not get the answers out there and then they turn inward this particular form of self reflection is quite positive and when individuals not judging it simply allow themselves to reflect and look inwardly the answers are forthcoming and they always arise anew almost as a new person when you inflict judgment because again everyone knows that's pretty anti-social rather than simply allowing the process that's what prolongs it and adds the nuance that seems like negative what you label depression if you simply allow yourself to understand i am in a period of self reflection i choose not to judge this what are the issues look at those issues allow yourself to integrate it and have inner dialogue you will find it to pass kite quite quickly and again arise from that state anew does that make sense yes it does i also find in having tears when she's crying to sit down and talk to her during the crying period she becomes more relaxed and calmer and also i find that through that process once she comes to that conditions more balanced well the idea is that that point she is constructively self reflecting rather than judging the state itself and the judgment of the state itself often brings along a particular style of frustration which compounds the judgment then the frustration is then judged and so forth the snowball effect so to speak so simply allow even that to be valid allow even that to be an indication of the timing for looking within share these ideas two more questions more generalized all of them one is the middle east situation which is going on now in Madrid there's a conference obviously i'm sure you're aware of all the middle eastern arid countries in the israelis sitting down for once and talking with each other and maybe hopefully coming to some sort of peaceful accord do you see that happening fairly shortly in terms of breaking down of their centuries of frustration and anger between all these different groups of people ultimately we see it occurring yes as far as soon perhaps not it is possible understand but the idea is that area is shall we say one of the remaining crucibles for the playing out of particular aspects of negativity and ultimately will integrate but there may be a little bit more shaking going on from our perspective not necessarily does this need occur and the timing has been accelerated a little bit from what we originally had expected so it's anybody shall we say idea as to how it will go but there is still some momentum behind the idea of perhaps some lingering conflict my final question to you is about astral projection i like to know specifically the technique i understand more about astral projection to your planet if i were to go to sleep tonight say okay i'm gonna astral project myself and just visit your planet and see what your society's like well when you find yourself in the astral state in a conscious aware state of mind and other words as conscious as you are right now you find yourself so to speak standing outside your body all you need to be able to in that sense visit our realm is simply use what we have spoken of earlier e motion energy motion that is the activating mechanism that will allow you to keep in on our vibration and the way you would do that is simply when you are in that state allow yourself to conjure up how you feel when you interact with us that is one way another way to picture particular symbols that are relevant to the vibration of our society for instance an equilateral triangle will do as a symbol a double tetrahedron will do as a symbol but when you are in that state there is no corresponding time lag between the having of the thought and the manifestation of the thought therefore you simply need think and imbue with emotion and you simply then take up residence in the new reality similar to your sleeping dream reality where you seem to flow from one reality into another effortlessly absolutely naturally then you wake up and when you analyze it say well how did i get from here to there the idea is you had the simple thought and the moment you had it you were that reality and it did not seem strange to you in the dream because that is the natural progression do you understand yes the idea also again as a reminder is that your consciousness does not reside within your body your body resides within your consciousness you may find it more helpful as an analogy this is still another limited idea it is simply an analogy to picture yourself as a bubble of consciousness the pinpoint center being your body when you quote unquote astraly travel from the perspective of your body you seem to have left a body you were within but the more shall we say accurate explanation is that you simply shift the focus of your consciousness from that pinpoint center to another place either within the substance of the bubble or along the skin of the bubble itself in that sense it's closing your eyes of consciousness in one particular portion of your being and opening it else way i understand finally one thing is popping my head this is my last final thought is that a one-time ask you about the city of whites do you have any further information on that since the last time we spoke about that at this time no however there are others that will assist you with this idea this will lead you to a next step and when you get to that point and share with us perhaps we can expand but begin to be at least aware and receptive to the assistance of others in this regard thank you very much as you do question i wish to thank you first of all for helping me do my channeling and connecting with my guide that you helped me get in touch with all right but we take no credit you did at all no i didn't go off but you kind of opened the door for me and that was very helpful and thank you for using us as a reflection in that way thank you very much for being there for me i have first one question one of my guide is a Canadian and i keep getting messages there is much work to be done with ladies and that the civilization needs to be rebuilt and that i'm supposed to travel there absolutely to help them to rebuild and i'm not sure i understand what they've done in a sense what you are in that sense exploring would translate and this is a bit colloquial in relative to your time stream to the past of the pleadian civilization and not their presence and it has to do with your or lending of your assistive energy in a sense in that way does that make sense no it will but so that their civilization right now contemporary to your time stream is not in that state in what you would label their past their history this is what you are interacting with through that particular entity there will be other entities more representative of the contemporary idea but i'm supposed to travel absolutely to the clades not so much supposed to but if you find yourself doing it you will then understand the purpose because my guide for the series also keeps talking about that i'm supposed to to ask for projection to to the constellation of series and that this is my next step and i'm not sure and i've drawn to actual projection but i'm not sure exactly what it is i'm supposed to do allow the assistance of the serious stream first they will aid you and directly facilitate your ability to do so also allow yourself to be attracted because again you are in a physical reality allow yourself to take advantage of the reality you are choosing to be within allow yourself to be attracted to the existing literature upon your planet at this time and become familiar with the already existing notions of what you label astral travel in other words do some research you know what we are not familiar with it by that name i know you know it came from two different gods with all the pyramids well with that type of corroboration keep your eyes out so thank you i have another question oh i have a our baby and my time is not free as it was to explore my different interests did you say so well it's not as free as it was and i was wondering if there are any advice you can give me on how to organize my time better so that i can be free to channeling to do healing work and things like that you will find if you continually begin to trust your excitement and act upon it that all things that need be done will have a space of time that you are excited about it when you squelch your excitement there's the apparent that there are particular things that arise that will simply never excite you but the idea is when you allow the natural flow and relationship with your excitement there is a timing that unfolds where all things wind up getting done did that try to do i think so so the flow that's what it is what it actually that will do but the idea is using your excitement as a guide in each and every moment oh i'm very excited but um i don't have as much quality time as do realize that you do have as much quality time and what you are doing is labeling and judging the time that you have therefore look at the reasons why you would do that and what you are believing to invalidate the timing also again if you are not following in your excitement and each and every given moment the whole mechanism gets a bit off kilter as you at this timing we will pause for a short break and resume contact with that individual in 10 to 15 of your minutes
