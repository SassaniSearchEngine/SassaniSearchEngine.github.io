 Allow me, for my brief moment of your time, to speak about the idea of truth. The ultimate truth is reality, the ultimate truth. By definition is composed of all truths. Therefore all truths are true to those who buy into them, to those who believe them. This does not mean that one truth cannot be mutually exclusive of another. However they are equally true in the ultimate sense. Therefore it is not so much this or that it is this and that which do you choose. You can learn in that sense to appreciate the vibration of a truth which you do not hold. That is equalizing, that is granting equality to all truths. Observation is your ability to establish what is true for you. This is true for me, this is not. That is observation. Judgment is assigning to a truth which is not true for you less equality. Rendering it down most simply as we have many times, observation is determining this is me, this is not me. This is me and the thing that is not me states. You do not have to go to that step of invalidating a truth which is not true for you. By being willing to validate any truth you equalize all truths. This gives you equal access to any truth that you prefer. Therefore you will never give less weight to a truth that you do not prefer by invalidating it. Your very invalidation, your very judgment that it is less than any other portion of creation puts your attention upon it in a way to give it more weight, not less. Therefore a way to begin to allow yourself equal access to the truth, to the realities that you prefer is by validating the ones that you don't. Now this does not mean you can don't have no. In no way shape or form does it mean that. It simply means that by taking the truth that you don't prefer and allowing any aspect of them be it large, be it my use to serve you in some way to allow you to learn something more about yourself. That is using everything in creation to your advantage. Therefore you can be given that sense to establish who you are without invalidating who you are now. Then you will be establishing peace within yourself, inner peace as you say. Then you will display outwardly this peace of mind. And when you act that way you will begin to see the reflections in your life outwardly that this is so. And you will begin to see the transformation upon your planet toward a peaceful loving world. Any change will always start within you. And any change that you are willing to allow within yourself because it then changes your vibration and therefore the filtration system through which you see will make it seem as though they have changed. You will only ever be able to perceive change in someone else not by forcing it upon them. But by changing that corresponding portion within yourself you will then allow yourself to interact with that aspect of them and they will have seen miraculously very often to have also changed. Just all we mention now allow us now to continue with the shedding over there. Shinning. Yes. I am truly curious that it is just you might have. I have spent the better part of my 48 years working and jobs that clearly were not much of a place to live. Well very often in your society we have noticed the tension for individuals to define who they are by giving themselves so many examples of who they are not. But simply you have done that already. Now you can begin as we have said to establish what excites you in the distinction again that you do not run from that which you know long. You walk toward that excitement which will in effect distance you from the things you do not refer. But anything you feel or perceive you are running from is actually following right behind you. My dilemma is that I just tell you something that I really love. I cannot figure out how to do things. And it is how it is. First of all we are recognizing that many of the things you consider upon you are planning to be professions. We are not always so and some individual very creatively manifested them as such. What is it that does excite you? Well the thing that excites me most of anything is forced to. Oh. And from our perception there is opportunity upon the autoclavity to make money in this way. Well I guess the last thing I would say was that ridiculous or I have any horses. Oh so very good. You then initially are invalidating that very exciting. That is all wrong. The reason we say this is all right is not because you need to continue to do that. But again you can change it to you only so at least you are being honest about what you do. Now see how you have acted having that belief that perpetuates that belief. Any belief system brings along with it a self-sustaining self-perpetuating system of logic and evidence. And again now to look at what does excite you and open your vision up toward the ways in that sense that you can connect with the opportunity that will allow you to do that. Is there something more specific to Kalamazoo? I don't think it is. I think the struggle is more how not to have a say have a do when you are talking about this. And doing what did not excite you, the universe still supported you to continue to be a being who did do what they did not respond. Recognizing will support you just as well being the being you do prefer. In fact they will see that you are being supported even more. Individuals in your society have an interest in shall we say uses of language. And that they say, but so I wish to do this most exciting thing but I will lose the security that doing what does not excite me allows me. Very interesting. What type of security do you have that allows you to securely remain who you are not what I have security. Therefore, this simply a definition change your definition use your imagination to conjure up how a person with the new belief would act. Let yourself really get into it. That's what you all imagine. And then act that way. Allow your imagination to set the template in your society you are quite expert at using your imagination. However, in general you use it negatively. You project not you personally necessarily although you also worst case the manual with which you then play them out in your imagination. And sometimes muster up great feeling great sorrow, great remorse, great angle how dare they treat me this way. You simply imagine that they did well business how powerful that truly is. Use it for the positive. Use it to see how a person that you desire to be already acts. You will be key into the vibration as we had said earlier of that person as the way they act is a manifestation of that vibration your simple willingness to act that way you will be that vibration in that moment and can choose to continue to recreate yourself as that new you. You will always have the option to become the old you so you need not fear you lose your security. Then again simply do. There are ways whenever you have an interest in your society to pipe into other individuals that are already doing your literature your magazines your fan class. This idea you can always I into what other suggestion would be to find an individual who is already doing the thing you say desire to do by being in the presence of that individual and begin to mimic their action. You will be that vibration and that is one of the simplest way in that sense to be able to do what it is you prefer by using the experience gathered by one already. Now that you have even granted yourself the possibility that you can do what excites you you will begin to attract yourself opportunity to continue to do so for that is how creation truly works. You have put it out there somewhat tentatively so but by doing it in this interaction in front of many you have boldly put it out. Now open your eyes for the feedback. All right. Thank you. Thank you very much. You understand when we say it is that simple that is the belief it is that complicated is also simply a belief individuals by into the necessity for complexity for that is the only way you will validate having made a change but that is not the only way you can simply do it and be that you right now. Just up to you. When you realize that adding degrees of complexity is a choice you may now wish to look at your other choices. It is completelyaleyDimada. That is the most important thing. Thank you for getting questions. What is my reply here in this view. And I really like the work that I do and I'm very excited to have this like, and you have the benefit to, and yet I don't have a security meeting that you come and are really important myself fully by doing what I like to do. Like I trust people who say, oh, I can't change what is. All right, well, understand this is your opportunity to view the overall category of abundance. A lot of us now can define, from our perspective, abundance. Listen very carefully for the word money. Our definition of abundance is the ability to do what you need to do when you need to do it. If you hear some money in there, trick question. The idea of being that money, although a valid representational symbol of abundance, is by no means the only form of abundance. And when you insist you will only allow your abundance to come in that one way, you are not looking for the other opportunity. If you reflect for just a moment, you will realize you always did have the ability to do what you need to do what you needed to do when you needed to do it. You may have chosen not to out of the sense of obligation, but you have always had that ability. When you will unconditionally accept your abundance in whatever form it comes, you will then be the vibration of an individual who unconditionally accepts their abundance. The unibundance will then deliver that abundance in proportion to your willingness to accept it. Now very often when you begin in that sense to accept your abundance in the many ways that it can come, you do get a lot of money for the abundance will always come in whatever form in the path of least resistance the simplest way. And very often, or shall we say, many times that may be if that is the symbol, you will be there in exactly the amount you need not one any less, not one any more. However, when you begin to accept your abundance from all directions, you begin to realize you never had a lack of abundance. Simply a perception of lack of abundance. You are always inherently abundant. And simply now we are giving you the choice to see that. Does this make sense? Will you begin in that way to open up your tunnel vision and allow the universe to deliver it in any way, whether it be trading, whether it be someone simply giving you a gift? Anyway. Well I think my issue is that I've been doing that and that's not focusing on the money. But you know, I accept trade and I do are end to free and I just think I'm going to have the time and run listening around it. But anyway, the abundance came in and like the friends and support from the whoever. But it looks like I need to manage my living to pay my bills. So I mean I feel like I can be focusing so much on this abundance rather than also like how it came I feel. Oh, but in a sense from our perspective, this is not exactly the act and you have been continuing to focus on the seeming growing lack of abundance. So therefore there is attention upon you. But the idea is continue to do what excites you. Do not say, oh, I did what excited me and I can't pay the rent. Then you are sitting and projecting a negative future in the now moment rather than doing what excites you in the now moment. And it is your willingness to perpetuate what excites you that will bring the opportunities that will handle any of the obligations. At first there is some negative trust when converting over to these beliefs that negative trust in that sense sometimes will seem to put in an individual, shall we say, path the issue of certain rising amounts of financial debt. But if you will not focus upon them and simply continue to do what excites you, they will not continue to gain momentum. And it is your assigning that there is a momentum there and allowing it to continue to have a momentum that makes it seem to be your snowball rolling down. Do you understand the concept? And we can do this first. Chet. Apparently, I think I've chosen not to love human beings on conditions. All right, many have an assessment, they're not explanation, you are in good company. Much less than this, but I'm getting more and more expensive to the animal thing. What's going on? The idea being that you are exploring your relationship with yourself for your ability to mug others and your willingness to judge them is only, again, proportional to your ability and willingness to love and or judge yourself. Therefore, we suggest to turn inward with the issues. Everything in your life can be looked at as being of service to you. If you are choosing to see someone or something as extremely begin to look at why you are choosing to do that. The animal reflection in that way is indicative of you being willing to love the portion of you, that is, shall we say, a bit more connected to all that is, a bit more intuitive, extinct, one moment instinctive and connected as we have said, but that is only one aspect. And if you will look at why you are judging another, you will find many, many interesting things about the way you feel about yourself. Is that all? Yes. Are you sure? I think so. Oh, and we thank you very much. Sure. I'm sorry. You. Me? Yes. Oh. I want to ask you a question about your mission. Oh, right. Can you speak up and read vaults of it all, Misha? Yes. Would I be likely to choose to reincarnate on your plan? In a sense, the easiest way to answer this is to turn it around. Would you? It is your choice. If you are saying you desire, it is the language. Do people do that? Oh, yes. Not so much the other way around, however. That is not because we invalidate your experience in any way, that we have in that sense have that exploration on whatever level we need to have desire to. What do you mean exploration of limitation? Not necessarily within your system, in our reincarnation class. Oh, so is that? It is not because this is any worse of a place that we do not. In fact, it happens from time to time, but in general, it happens to allow us, by living a life upon your planet, to have some commonality to bring back so that we can have these communications. For you see, we are far more alien to you than you might imagine. And without our ability to live a life or lives upon your planet, there would not be from our end, enough perspective, enough commonality. You would be far too alien to us. So therefore it is more of an exploration from our end when we reincarnate in that direction. However, hours to sign is only between 200 and 250 million individuals that shall we say permanent quote, unquote population. The rest in that sense are comprised of what you might loosely label trithed in. That being, other consciousness, who in that way, embarked upon partaking of our reality, however, only for a single life, or a portion of a single life. If in that sense you are willing to explore what you label, there is a misnomer, but we will use your label, astral projection. You can visit our planet in this form anytime. And upon arrival we will be assigned a representational body from our society. So therefore you can do it right now. You can in that sense that you desire understanding that what happens to you upon death is what you most strongly believe. Be given now to by strongly into that truth. And it can be that simple. Let me tell you the question of how we could come a bit too rambolous. No, I understand that. I have one other question. Oh, hi. I have read that tonight that a lot of us leave our bodies in our own problem. From our perspective you all did. However, there is no commonality through which to bring it back as a memory. For when you are in your sleeping dream or reality, and we use that word intentionally for your dreams, or just as much of a reality as this dream, simply you fall asleep into that dream and wake up into this one. But the idea is the portions of those realities that have some corresponding frame of reference to this reality, you bring back as a quote memory. The one power that are more representative of your totality, of your non-physical portions of your beingness, do not have a frame of reference through which in this mode that you have created yourself, you can bring it back. And very often when individuals seem to open their eye of consciousness in another physical quote unquote locality, they will not have the frame of reference to bring that back as a memory. Good luck. Thank you very much. Thank you. Could you please explain how that lies to me? One moment, can you repeat that? A bit more. Okay, parallel lies. I'm not clear about. Is it? One song would choose to incarnate two bodies at the same time. That would be called counterpart in that sense, soul, man of the station. Beyond here, a parallel lies more precisely. Would represent the idea of you are, and we will be quite colloquially. We'll understand how it is. Walking down your road, you come to a fork. You, or the you that you know yourself to be, goes down the right, shall we say, from of the fork. There is in that sense, in a parallel reality, a you loosely speaking that walked down the lens. And therefore, all possibilities are played out on some level of your totality. You as the being that you choose to be seen in that sense, to have a continuity. And that continuity is who you deserve yourself to be. Does this illuminate or does it make it more? Yes. Yes. The point is that all realities are real. Anything you can imagine is played out. However, the you you consider yourself to be, does not shall we say, deem it necessary to be consciously aware of all those parallels. Therefore, you are not. But they do occur and are on the level. So, my self is living tomorrow, under the plane, or even on this desk with me. That's what I'm trying to get to. Okay. The you that took the left turn still exists on an earth where the you took the left turn. That is a parallel self. When as an over soul, you manifest yourself within a single time frame, life's sadness more than one individual, that is counter parts. You do have counter parts. When you colloquially speaking die and merge with your higher self or over soul, you will also be aware of those other selves. You have a will seem to absorb them. From their perspective, they will seem to absorb you. This is one of the paradoxes of reality. You are all separate. You all as you expand perceive that everything in all reality is merging to you. Therefore, you retain your sense of individuality, your identity, but so does everyone else. We understand this is a bit hard to wrap your mind around because it is an infinite concept being rendered to finite exploration. But does that help at all? Yes, it is not that you thank you. Over there in Mayo. Sure. There you are. In the history of mankind, as you know, our rivals have been trying to get beaten into battle axes, swords, missiles, and so forth. Not only that particular book, many other ideas, many ideologies, many individuals, but interesting. Yes, yes. I was wondering, did you speak of some of the lives of some of the original individuals behind the part of major religions? Specifically, yeah. In perhaps their combination, if they have a common division? The idea is that there were as many visions as there were individuals. Is there some specific in that point of information that you see? You are being a bit heavy? Okay. I'm looking forward to curative integration in the religions. All. Yeah. I'm trying to just proceed with what might be the foundation of the basis. The idea being again that you will begin to integrate your stuff, then they will seem to change by looking forward to that integration. You in that sense push it ahead and keep having it beat off into the future. Then by assigning that it will happen externally before you will validate the change. However, that is also a paradox. Any outward validation that you get will only correspond to first, inwardly, validating it. Therefore, when you begin to integrate these ideas within yourself and walk as a living example of this integration, you will then attract the individuals of life mind around you and begin to see exponentially this integration and the individuals really next to integrate them no longer focus on the deal integration. I say each individual that uses all the transformers, they don't make a great deal. So the transformation begins in each individual. Always happen. Always. Thank you very much. And to for your willingness to begin to look forward to it. However, looking within is only the beginning. Acting will always be the end. Have we done it? Sure. That's your honor. Thank you. Has your physical form been on our planet? In the way that you mean put on the ground? No. No. In terms of what you might loosely label a fly-by? Yes. I have not personally landed upon your planet. I have, however, shall we say observed from my space track from time to time. Did you communicate with a physical form even with your fly-by? Okay. Yes. On two occasions in particular, the very reasons for the visit were to act as a trigger. And in that sense, sparkle a subconscious agreement within another individual, Darl Aika, from your West Coast area. That was the initiator of channeling of our energy on the planet. Can you tell me what your name means? Where did your name come from? Oh, thank you very much. For giving me the opportunity to say that Vashal is not my name. We have, upon our society, no names for say. For we no longer have language. We are tell and Catholic beings. I do not say tell a Catholic because tell empathy is far more the mechanism. Identifying ads and individuals to love them is to know them and therefore create the same thoughts at the same time. The reference Vashal was chosen, shall we say, to allow some commonality for you to interact with our stream and have had, shall we say, many significance. The word itself stems from shall we say some of the ethnic background of Darl Aika. And also has, in that sense, been discovered to have said only one is commander. And in that sense, loosely speaking, I am a commander of sorts. Not that there is a hierarchy, not that I am anybody boss, but in that sense, you may loosely say I am the commander of my spacecraft. Also, it means simply the messaging. Also, it means simply man person. And you may find as you explore and have the willingness to do so, it will also have other meanings. Thank you. Absolutely. Is that all? Yes. Thank you. All of that, amen. Yes, Bishar. Thank you. I was believing. I was wondering if you could perhaps help me identify an emotion that I feel on a fairly consistent, certainly consistent in the given situation. Oh, I may defy. Okay. The, I can't define the emotion. That's what my question is, is for helping defining it. But it occurs at times consistently at a ballet, at a theatre, most recently at a theatre. Recently at a children's jazz dance. I mean, reasons, at times when I can't see any reason for the strength of emotion that I'm experiencing. Can you describe in any way that emotion? I'm... And there is purposeful mess in our question. Okay. It's overwhelming. It's, I don't feel that I have control over it. It's a physical... I want to cry, physically cry. Oh, would you label from the shall we say usual standpoint that you have, if you be a positive or negative emotion? Well, I felt that you were going to ask me that and I've been thinking about that. Oh, baby. I really haven't come up with an answer because it's crying and because of, I guess, my long-term beliefs I had thought. That it was... Look, I would think that it was bad, but I'm not crying from joy, but I'm not crying from sadness. And they're the only two emotions that I know who attached to that. Invest in... is dancing. You're listening. No. One moment. Is there something in that way that you have not shared? I'm sorry, I don't understand the question. Is there some other bit of information that you have not shared? In that sense, we are not in that way finding the opening or the access of this information. And very often what this will mean is that you are withholding something. I think I can think that I'm... maybe withholding is perhaps some of the other occasions that I'm filled with this same emotion. Oh, right people. Other times it comes to me, we're at church. Other times in watching television, I mean it could be a commercial. It doesn't necessarily have to be a stat or a happy movie. It consistently happens. Is this feeling more along the lines of an appreciation or grief? Beyond. In other words, upon your planet individuals, when moves can be driven to tears of joy, that is appreciation. If an individual on the other hand is experiencing three, which is simply a, shall we say, idea that something can be separated from you, which since you are part of everything, it cannot. Those are two distinctly separate interpretations. Those either ones seem to apply more strongly. It's your life, not grief. Oh. Therefore you may say that you are choosing in these instances through your allowance to harmonically, attune to the vibration of certain, shall we say, activities and expressing the release of appreciation through identification. That is our strongest perception based on the knowledge you have shared. However, does that ring a bell for you? If I understand correctly, what you are saying is that it's my appreciation of what I am witnessing that is causing the emotion and the emotion. Oh, your alignment with that particular event and the corresponding release. It's not. It's quite healthy, quite natural, quite positive. So it is not necessarily from some association from a previous time or anything like that. It's just a simple can be. However, our awareness of any particularity is being shielded. Therefore, we assume that if not, shall we say the most relevant idea? As you can use your imagination in that way to pipe into any of those streams. And if you will validate what you get, you can embellish the information we are sharing. However, how perceptive is to focus most strongly on when it occurs, where you are right now, what is happening, and not need to draw a line into a future on its hands. In other words, appreciate your appreciation in the moment. Yes, very much so. So it's not necessary to stop the emotion or to try to. Oh, no. It's probably not. You cannot, anyway. It will simply gain more momentum and come out another time. But you remember, an emotion, emotion, energy, emotion is always the result of a belief system. So therefore, when individuals in the audience decide, sometimes saying, well, I just feel that way, I can't help it. This is not entirely accurate. If you will look at the belief that you have, that then results in that corresponding emotion. If it is a belief, you do not prefer it. You can check it. And then your new emotion will be relevant to the new belief. Negative beliefs, limiting beliefs will have a tendency to generate what you label negative emotion. Now we appear, anger, frustration, judgment. It is all perceptive. It is all standpoint. It is all. Thank you. So simply enjoy. Have a good time. Allow yourself to release and understand that that relief thing in the moment it is occurring. Has you at complete sentiment and you are then sentiment. If you will even allow that to be the reason, you will glean a whole new set of realities from these experiences. All right. Yes, thank you very much. And you are so shabby. Over there, over there. For sure. It seems to me that psychotherapy is the purpose of it is to help people follow their excitement yet, it's often along and sometimes not completely successful process. Is it necessary? In a sense, we do not speak of should, should it, necessarily, not necessary. It is a path. It is a choice. Certain individuals have success with it. Many do not. From our perspective, it is a truth. No less true than the truth we buy into. Now the truth we buy into is that you always only live this in the now. Think about it. Only always ever, experiationally exist in the now. You therefore, when having a memory, are recreating the past in the present. As much weight as you are willing to give that recreation in the present will determine its effect upon you. If you are one to give it much weight, then that system of an... What's this? Allows individuals to go back colloquially. Speaking, they are still creating it in the now and reconcile something that they are creating in the now that they have not reconciled back then. From our perspective, however, anything done in your past is done. What you need to get from it, you got from it. If you heal in that sense that you need to get something from it now, that is a choice. And you are drumming up, recreating that past, not entirely accurately, for you are a new person with a new vibration and new filters. And as much weight as you are willing to give it will determine its effect upon you. If you are willing to simply note it, look at what you did, and then resets yourself into the now moment and see what's right in front of you, not fixating upon it. It will have no effect on you and will simply be nice information. But again, our perspective is that you always have in any now moment everything you need to continue to be who it is you chose to be in this lifetime, living your life of preference, excitement and joy. And therefore, you also create the future from the present. And if you are holding back in the now moment because of a perceived future, a perceived outcome, you are simply not taking advantage of that now moment and spending that now moment in an imagined past and an imagined future. Since we are a people of limitation, is there a way that we can use psychotherapy more effectively to follow our excitement? In any way that your imagination will show you, or your imagination will always cater any process to you most individually. So if you feel the need to rehash that old stuff, go right ahead. You do not have to. You can't simply look at what's right in front of you in any now moment and proceed as the person you are right now. For you always re-create yourself in every now moment. You are literally a different person than you are when you walk into this interaction. Your willingness to look at it and act that way will be up to you. But if you simply look at the person you prefer to be and act that way from this moment forward, that paths will seem to have little or no relevance to the you are now. So do not focus upon it unless you wish to. How do we let go of our limitations? Simply, first by recognizing you have chosen them, seeing how they serve you so that you can allow them to deliver their intended message. Any symbol in your reality, it's simply you delivering yourself some message, some idea in the form of an ex... The label you are giving it is not the message. Or the symbol would not still be there, it would transform. So if you are again forcing something to seemingly stay the same, you are not cleaning the reason you created, be a bit more creative. Don't only look at what seems to be most obvious. Begin to look around issues, around events. Begin to again widen your scope of vision. It is not the message. Do you have... Yes, it is. Do you have of God consciousness? In a sense from our perspective, we label God all that is because that is quite a precise definition. There is nothing that is without God. Everything is within all that is. From our perspective, there is one all that is, one God. Now within that one God, one all that is, there are many individuals with different representations and interpretations of what that one God is. But all those versions, all those representations of God are still within the one all that is. And from our perspective, we simply pipe into the one, overall, all that is. We recognize that being part and parcel of God are all that is means that we are expressions of the Internet. We are made in the image and likeness of the Internet. Therefore, we also are multi-dimensional, infinite, and eternal. So really the best answer is our relationship with God or all that is, or God consciousness is quite direct. For we do not draw a distinction or separation between ourselves and all that is. We understand it to be all one thing. Can we do that? You already did. Simply. Now you can do it consciously. If you like what I am saying, you only like it because you contain it. This is another paradox upon your planet. Individuals actually become what you label jealous, not in the situation of other individuals, because they believe that they teach something in another individual that they themselves do not contain. But the irony is they must contain it or they would not see it. You can only perceive something if you first contain it. So when you see something in any other individual or when you see an idea that attracts you and you are excited about it, that is your indication that you already contain it. Simply. Now you can choose to express it. Yes, is expressing unconditional love the path to raising our consciousness? Shall we say the wicked most accelerated path, but every individual is a path. So therefore they are all paths. If you are speaking of very quickly, yes. For you will always when unconditionally loving use all your creations. And then when you quote, colloquially speaking, use up the ones you unconsciously created that you don't prefer. You only then create ecstatic, joyful circumstance in your life. An ecstatic explosion of coincidence and conscious recognition of synchronicity. The fact that everything fits everything has a reason. And just one last question. If I wanted to go to your planet right now, how would I do it? Simple. As we have said, your quickest access would be to access the literature or any thing that excites you upon your planet about astral projection. For right now that is the only way you can visit us. And it is quite simple. If you will even believe that it is possible. And there are many many many many individuals upon your planet who consciously do this and you can easily seek them out and find them. There is the literature that has been known to the channel of an individual view label, Robert Monroe. That may be a place to start. It is a book. All right. Thank you very much. And to you. Over there. I need to identify to understand this question about the science. We agree. I also feel that I'm a professional. I'm going out of this to a specific state. I'm trying to understand the science. Very exciting. I also feel that I'm going to ask you to answer the question about the science. One more question. Can you all hear this answer? Please speak up so that all may share your gift. I feel that I'm at the first and then we're very close to the other side. I would like to answer the question. All right. First of all, recognize that we are somewhat third density word depth and the word problem to a simply a judgment. Therefore, we prefer to substitute when individuals in your society say problem. A situation that you have not allowed to transform. You go on. Andy Gold. Andy Gold. I wanted to know where it is going to be right. I can confirm that right. I can see the question. Oh yes. And you recognize although lovingly, gently, subtly, nudged by that individual, it will always only be up to you to actually do. And it is no accident that you are now becoming aware of excitement. When individuals upon your planet ask what is my purpose in life, that is not your excitement is your indication of your purpose. That's why we're excited about it. There are no dangling carrots in creation unless you create them that way. And the reason your excitement is individual is because that is your sign. That you always ask for. Again, it is no accident that you have come in contact with this idea and it may possibly be the last remaining quote unquote missing piece of your puzzle. Is that all? And we thank you, that's all. Shame. Sure. In it. And just hear it. What's nervousness? Can be, several things, can be anxiety. We have expressed an explain. That excitement and anxiety are the same energy. Simply excitement is a positive interpretation of that energy. And anxiety is a negative invalidating interpretation of that energy. Can also be different degrees of fear. And again, loosely speaking, there are many definitions, but fear is believing that a reality you do not prefer is most likely. So therefore, it is an emotional indicator to allow you to see again what you are believing. All emotions are a response to a belief system. Therefore, you can always use any degree of it to, in that sense, identify your beliefs and differences. I don't see you looking out at it. Can you be more specific? As you mentioned, I'm late last year I thought you'd get a real starter buy. And I'm in here, but I'm kind of a fellow making the things. I've got myself in a few deep combinations. But do listen to your definitions, do listen to your wording and do understand they are representative of your beliefs, which are not etched in stone, but go on. Alright, yeah, because I'm kind of unloaded, straight down, and doing myself reading. Oh, that would sound in that way like a cop or a cop. Yeah, and it's not working anymore, so you don't want to talk with it. Not yet, anyway. The idea is there is many ways upon your planet for exchanging goods. Are we going? If you say so, but that's in that way in the case to me that you are not, shall we say, viewing all the legal options. Alright, let's be impressed. Again, we will get a bit more specific, we usually refrain from doing so, but you can't put it out in your paper and sell your truck yourself. Yeah, but I'll lose one here. Alright, we do understand that with that attitude you will. Why in that sense are you placing that limiting belief upon something which you desire to do? Why are you in actuality insisting that you cannot have a positive outcome from this? I don't really want to get rid of it. Ah, I like this thing. Therefore, not to be redundant, for it is always the first time. Do what excites you the most at any given moment, any money, any abundance you need to keep your truck. Now that you have at least admitted to yourself that you desire to keep it will come. But if you are doing those things that are very different from sitting around and worrying about the payment, one is passive, one is active. Again, you're mighty commercial. And we thank you as well. There will be, but a few moments left to this, that you're actually sharing. Sure. Okay. I was just wondering quite a few people have spoken about that this junior path, your planet is just a part of that, it's a attraction. And in the first reference I mentioned that your body would be assigned to that. I was curious to see how that function weather is taking out of the body, whether it's to be able to moment, or whether it's something you want to take. Oh, thank you very much. What a good question. The idea is no problems. You're not hanging them on books. The idea being that either it will be, because everything upon our planet is consciously recognized as synchronicity. Either it will be an individual just born, or in general, in general. An individual who has only chosen to have a partial experience. So in that sense, loosely speaking, it will be a shared vessel. It will be a one. One will be departing as you come in. One will be a one. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, and to you as well. We in that sense look forward to your vision. Hello, Billy. Can you tell me the vision of the whole we are in the future? The reality of vision is totally. Oh, for sure. Yes. I just got some. Oh, very good. How does it feel? The current vision. The wonderful cognition. Regarding our earlier discussion on religions. When an individual truly agrees that he can transform all religions, can he integrate them all? He is operating as the creative source. He becomes the creative. What a genius. Very good. Great. This frequently happens. That is all that is doing. At this time, allow us to again thank you all. Your willingness to open up to the many portions that you have created your consciousness to have is the beginnings of your integration of those compartments, of those separation. Your vibration is always the vibration of a 100% whole being. You in that sense define yourself as existing within compartments. You have very nice labels and names for these compartments. Subconscious, superconscious, unconscious, in ego, super ego. They are real when you create them. They seem real when you believe them. They, however, are occurring within your 100% blended home. In that sense, they allow you to take portions of yourself and hide them from other portions. Very interesting cosmic game of hide and seek. This has an effect on your overall vibration to make it less continuous, seeming. As you begin to integrate, as you begin to open up, as you begin to look at everything you have sucked in any closet of your being, you begin in that way to take on a smoother, more continuous vibration of higher frequency. You then begin to be able to view others in that way. Your willingness to take any vibes that you get and assign them good vibes labeled. Will determine your willingness to allow things to be of service to you rather than seeming pointless and extraneous. There are no pointless and extraneous creations. Think about it. If it exists, it has a point. It has a reason. It is only an individual's label that something is extraneous, that then has them act as though it is extraneous and not be able to glean why it is there, for they refuse to see it as anything but extraneous. Nothing is, you can use it all. You can assign good vibes to all and understand from our perspective. Regardless of your individual willingness to do so, we always will be in that way anyway. For to us, you are each and every one of you, a gift. When you allow us to unwrap you, it gives us great joy. And we understand that that is the ultimate gift that one consciousness can share with another. We do not take this lightly and we love you most unconditionally. We bid you most exciting dream lives and life dreams. And they fond and loving you. Good day.
