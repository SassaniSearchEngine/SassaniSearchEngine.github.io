 Alright, I'll say I bid you greasy this evening of your time as you create time to exist. I will not ask you how you are, for I know that you are all perfect, a perfect reflection of anything that you are exploring in any given moment. Take my word for it, if you will. Allow me to entitle this interaction, factoring in your excitement. We have been discussing with many of you for some time a simplified version, a simplified explanation for how you create your experience as physical beings. You are fundamentally consciousness and the idea of your physical life, your physical expression, your linear reality experience is a statement or an expression of your consciousness. So complete is this expression of linear existence that you actually begin to wrap yourself so firmly within the idea of time and space that you actually impose a forgetfulness that you are in fact pure consciousness. Often you will begin to recognize once again that you have consciousness and begin to express yourself at having a consciousness, having a mentality, having thought patterns, but truly and most accurately this is only one way to look at it and that you do not have a consciousness but you are a consciousness expressing yourself in physical terms, expressing yourself in linear terms and the way in which your consciousness interacts with itself to produce the effect you call physical reality and the maintenance of physical experience is true as we have simplified the idea that in each and every given moment you number one decide who you are number two you trust that decision number three you act as though you trust that decision and your actions reflect that decision and then seem to create an interaction and expression result relationship interaction that seems to produce a result that result then create the idea of the face of your life and so on each and every moment you literally literally recreate yourself 100% through decision I am this person I am this way I do this thing and part of the definition as you make this decision is you build into the decision the idea that I am the person I was but a moment ago with a slight small change and so the apparent is that you are the same exact person going through an experience but literally what is happening is in each and every moment you are recreating yourself 100% completely anew with many of the definitions you have here to for held about yourself built into that decision and this creates the apparent thing you call continuity in making the decision you register your consciousness in trusting the decision you maintain that decision you continue to decide that that is who you are and then again the outward expression in physical reality is your actions which then embodied the trust and the decision and produce the result which seems consistent with the decision you do this automatically you do this generally with no one ever telling you this is what you are doing but nevertheless this is how you create when you begin to awaken your consciousness when you begin to expand into the idea that you can begin to create your reality consciously rather than have as it be or randomly you begin to factor in the idea of having the decision be conscious which generally takes the form of having the decision be according to desire and preference rather than the random idea that you are handed a reality that you are handed a decision even if you create the idea that it seems that you are handed the decision of who you are only do you get the effect of being the person you are when you agree with that decision and that is truly simply making a decision and so in discussing the idea of creating consciously we begin with using your desire using your preference using your discernment from the infinite potential of ways that you can define yourself to narrow down who it is you want to be who it is you wish to be and therefore then make your decision I am this particular person with these qualities consciously according to preference according to the person that you ideally see yourself to be which in fact you are for you are everything your consciousness is infinite your physical expression is an apparent thing of being finite but because you are fundamentally infinite you contain it all and the good news if you wish to look at it this way is that that means you can choose from anything and certainly one of the options is to choose to be the person you desire to be the person again you ideally picture that you are where we now wish to tie this all together is in discussing the idea of discerning who you are and allowing you to see that you have a built in mechanism in each and every moment that you can use to choose from what seems to be available in any given moment we have discussed the idea many times of what you call excitement and when we ask individuals what do you think excitement actually is they will generally describe the emotion perhaps the sensation perhaps the physical characteristics of excitement but what we actually are asking is what causes you to feel excited and the answer is that that is your sense of discernment telling you that of anything that is available in front of you the thing that excites you the most that you can express with integrity is the strongest choice is the choice that is most aligned with who you choose to be that is why it excites you that is why it invokes within you the vibration of feeling motivated and inspired passionate not simply to tease you not simply because it is a random emotional response but because it is your inner core if you will expressing in no uncertain terms of these choices this choice is most neat and as you say in your vernacular you feel most jazzed about that choice there are certain distinctions that we wish to perhaps review according to the idea of excitement often individuals will ask either each other or us what is my purpose in life and this seems to be a very popular subject that you discussed my purpose and what I am suggesting is that your purpose is whatever excites you the most perhaps you can call that your overall purpose the thing that stands out as being most excited most motivated most inspiring creates the idea of passion can be understood to do so because it is the purpose through which you have expressed your physical vision however if it seems that you are excited overall most excited about one thing that is not your entire purpose though it is a focused function of your purpose allow me to explain what we have just discussed is the idea of the thing that excites you the most as being perhaps you can say and not the but an overall purpose in your life but there is also the moment to moment consideration in that in each and every given moment there are choices available that seem unique to that moment different choices than you've ever had different choices than you seem to have just had different choices than you will have in but a moment's time and so in each and every moment by definition in linear reality there is a unique set of choices a set of choices that is unique to that moment of those choices always will one or perhaps more than one but a finite number of them will stand out as being more compelling more exciting and this is also your purpose your overall purpose is the combination of the thing that seems to excite you the most and anything that excites you the most of what's available in any given moment now often these two things the overall thing and the idea of the thing in the moment that is most exciting can seem completely unrelated in fact one may actually seem to be a side track of the other what allows you to understand that they are not opposed or contradictory is the commonality of the excitement about them and therefore what I am getting at is that whatever excites you that you can act upon with integrity in the moment no matter whether it seems to have anything to do with the overall thing that excites you the most it absolutely is essential for the thing that excites you the most or it wouldn't excite you and therefore the excitement itself tells you of anything that is available to me right now that I can act upon with integrity this is the most representative of who I am therefore this is an expression of the purpose of my whole entire life and so therefore you can use the excitement as a tool of alignment now we have mentioned several times in this interaction the idea of acting upon that excitement with integrity so allow me to in that sense explain a little bit more perhaps concisely what I mean by integrity allow me to start by saying what I do not mean by integrity which is the moralistic told that the idea of integrity can mean and when you interpret integrity as a sense of given morals that you will understand that integrity can vary across the board and that the morals of the different factions of your society can sometimes be completely contradictory so there is no true underlying moralistic integrity that is the integrity for everyone what we mean by integrity is the understanding that you are consciousness and infinite consciousness expressing yourself as a physical being and therefore everything that you experience as a physical reality exists within you and is one thing with you is an expression of you and the idea the understanding of the idea that everything is all one thing and that you are expressing that idea through your very consciousness is the idea of your understanding of integration the interrelated nature of everything in reality the holographic if you will into relationship of things in reality so understanding that reality is one integrated whole that you are expressing within you integrity acting with integrity expresses itself as being mindful that everything is an expression of you that everything is an extension of you that everything is a reflection from you and to you and therefore the attitude that accompanies that knowing this is a certain respect or validation for what is going on and when your actions are reflecting that validation they take on what you refer to as positive tone so it may seem like functioning with this definition of integrity does create a moral structure but that is not what we mean when we say when we say act with integrity we mean act with the underlying understanding that your reality is an integrated whole and treating everything with the same respect as you would demand yourself for it is all you treating yourself interacting with yourself as seemingly an external reality and so therefore from choices that are available if something stands out as being excited either you will find that you can act upon it with this understanding of integrity and express the knowingness the compassion the unconditional lovingness that you yourself wish to in that sense receive or you may understand that it excites you but acting on it at this time would clearly be out of your integrity and this is a very important distinction in following your excitement if you factor out the integrity you can create the idea you refer to as running a mock if you factor in the integrity you are always acting from your center using the feedback of the discernment of excitement to allow you to see who you are in the situation and then acting as an integrated being expressing that excitement in physical terms and so what we mean by factoring in excitement is to use the excitement and the ability to act upon it with integrity to assist you in any given moment to formulate and to reestablish or restate your decision for when your decision is I am a being that expresses myself fully with integrity with unconditional lovingness to myself and others because that is a function of integrity then you will understand that the output of such an attitude is always only positive and no matter whether that action may seem like the societal norm or not only can it add on to you and your experience and any other individual who comes in contact with you because it is an expression of who you are in the most positive of terms and so using your excitement is quite simple you can always easily discern what excites you if you are simply willing to say all right this is a moment this is a moment with unique choices here what the choices are this one and this one and this one stand out as being most exciting this one that is most exciting does not appear that I can act upon it with integrity so I will push that aside these two appear that I can act on them with integrity I have to but one of them is immediately available that is what lets you know that the timing the immediate availability can also be factored in choosing with your excitement and functioning with that excitement through your integrity so what we are introducing is literally a barometer of who you are both overall the thing that excites you the most and moment to moment to moment to moment from what is available the things which stand out as obviously being more compelling we bring this up to put as you say the icing on the cake of understanding that although you may express yourself in many many many many way as an infinite being through physical means that you actually have the option to express yourself naturally flowing joy purposefully effectively productive while still being willing to honor who you are to the greatest degree for a not denying who you are and being willing to express who you are fully then you become of the greatest service to other individuals who will use you as a reflection in their consciousness from what they are exploring and this allows individuals to see that yes I understand that I can function randomly with haphazard results but also I see individuals who function purposefully with positive results not necessarily always what they expect but positive outcomes nevertheless and so you do yourself the greatest service by being willing to express who you are with as you say no holds bar you do everyone else the greatest service because in expressing yourself that clearly you allow them the opportunity not that they need to but that they have attracted you for a reason to see an example an expression of clarity of purpose of joyfulness and so always in any given moment it can be completely as obvious as you say as the nose on your face which of the options stands out as being most exciting in that you can act upon it with integrity one last thing before we proceed to what you call the interaction individuals will sometimes play perhaps you can call it the shell game with their overall excitement and other words they may say well I don't really know what excites you allow me to say that this is never the case perhaps you have allowed yourself to be talked out of what excites you perhaps you have taken the weight of the words of others to allow you to make the decision that what excites you is not valid or important but always always always do you and only you know what truly excites you the most when I say this this will generally turn the key from any individual to say well all right yes I do know what excites me and I had not wanted to acknowledge it because then I might have to do something about though there still are individuals who will play the next layer of the shell game of saying well I still can't even determine what excites me at all so allow me to offer up what you call the following tool for individuals who feel that they do not have direct access to what excites them the most and this direct tool can simply be called all right the magic lamp and the idea to simply ask yourself if I had a lamp and could rub it and make the wish to be the person I truly wish to be who would I be often with the idea of the miracle of the magical genie in the lamp you will allow yourself to drop your guard drop the excuses and truly put before you what it is that excites you the most with no holds bar then you can look at it and test it to see well yes it does really excite doesn't seem like something I can really do necessarily and that's why I couldn't acknowledge it but it does excite and you will find that the moment you are willing to validate that it truly is the most exciting thing for you you will find that your attitude in that moment will already shift and you will begin to entertain the idea well no one had ever said I could ever do this but perhaps just perhaps maybe it is possible and that is the beginning deciding to be excited allowing yourself to be excited at which point factoring in moment to moment to moment excitement into your decision all right a circumstance a series of choices come belong and you say all right I am this person I am this type of person whatever parameters you plug into that when you notice which excites you the most you can embellish that decision to include the idea of the thing that excites you I am this particular person who likes to do this particular thing and the excitement allows you to further define and hone in on who it is you are at first it may seem as though you are seeking searching all right from these choices which excites me which excites me here which excites me now which excites me now but this is only because you have denied yourself this vibration and being frivolous for so long once you begin to consciously decide to discern what excites you from the choice is available and begin to do this consistently you will find it will become quite automatic you will simply know there's the exciting thing I don't even need to know the other choices and what this creates is a moment to moment to moment connecting of the dots that all together creates the picture of the most exciting thing and though one particular set of dots and lines between them again may appear to have nothing to do with the overall exciting thing when you step back and look at the whole picture those dots and the lines that connect them were essential the picture would be complete incomplete the picture would be incomplete without them and that is when it becomes more evident that certain things that excite you in the moment that you can act on with integrity are actually related to the most exciting thing no matter what the appearance is and so if it is necessary if you are denying to yourself what it is that truly excites you rub the lamp make the wish watch for what you wish for and learn more about who you are from seeing what you choose only you know you if someone else tells you who you are and you then fulfill that prophecy of their version of who you are it is not because they have defined it is because at some point in some given moment you have made the decision of agreeing with their assessment and entrusting that decision is acting that way you put out the expression that seems to confirm they were right they knew me better than I knew myself but that I remind you is not possible you know you the best and your excitement is your number one key to knowing who you are to allowing choices to stand out in relief of the rest of the choices in a very obvious and serendipitous way so therefore if you are willing to factor in your excitement then the process of conscious self expression becomes immediately fun immediately joyful immediately exciting and invigorating and do not miss this point unless you wish immediately productive no matter what anyone else says and you will connect more dots as you begin to do this to make it more apparent that you are being productive by acting on who you know yourself to be in each and every moment rather than someone else is version of who they think you are this is the way that we function as being so again quite automatically we simply have this approach and do not even give it any thought as you will not once it simply becomes as you say all I allow me to share with you that the main reason that we interact with members of your society is the fact perhaps you would say the mere fact that it excites us to interact with you we understand from our point of view you are an expression of us you are a reflection to me of my consciousness and so therefore when you say something particularly that I do not expect I immediately learn more about myself since one of my purposes is to know as much about myself as possible I find this quite exciting and so I thank you for allowing me to express my excitement and the collective excitement of members of my civilization in this perhaps you would call it quite unconventional matter I thank you for the honor of your willingness to share your version of your consciousness with us for again we grow and learn that much more about the universe and therefore that much more about ourselves and this is a great gift that is not taken lightly by us and we thank you for it in return for your willingness to express who you are and include us in the picture I thank you and ask you how through sharing we may usually be of service to each other share it with you. I have with what you were discussing I have some problems with in my life as far as purpose and like words you use as you know as far as being productive or excitement some of the most exciting things to me are maybe it's a definition maybe a different definitions of productive but so much of my excitement comes from things that at least people here generally in my society would not consider productive. All of them allow me to address that first of all by saying that a problem that you seem to think that you have is simply a situation that you have not yet allowed to transform so no problem at all simply a matter of realigning redefining who you are understand that the notion is generally put forth that if I do what excites me it will be frivolous and non-productive and so what do you do you don't actually act on what excites you you constantly think about acting on what excites you and so it seems to constantly be the same thing that excites you but when you are willing to commit yourself an action to the things that excite you and I remind you acting on them with integrity then you have done that thing and whatever it produces will be obvious and then often if it is not a type of repetitive thing now that you have done that you open up your vision to see the next thing that excites you simply honoring the idea of what excites you and acting on it has a result plays out now that's over with and that puts you in a new position to see new things that might excite you now that you have been willing to act upon it so much of what you are sharing with me as reservations about it has simply been an unwillingness to do that thing see what happens and then move on to the next thing do you wish to be more specific about something which may excite you in that sense very much that you feel might not be productive or which you may have a rigid definition of what productive means if you were to do that thing. So I think what I am trying to say is I can do something you know I will give you an example all right. You know when a chipmunk eats seeds out of my hand or a bird eats seeds out of my hand that excites me and I want to do it again and I want to do it more. And why would you not do such a thing. But it is not productive. Oh so that's what the chipmunk is. Is it not obviously productive does it not bring you both joy does it not able enable you to express yourself in a way whereby you can understand the integrity of all things by seeing the harmony in what you call nature. Well just now are you thinking of waking up and feeding chipmunks all day long and doing nothing else. I think my basic problem is that the things that I love to do the things that excite me do not make money. Today do not make money. And I understand what you are saying. Fundamentally I understand what you are saying. It annoys me this push for us to find our purpose that we have to have. By the way you are the only one doing the pushing. No one is pushing you to find your purpose. But the idea is once you recognize the things that are right in front of you as standing out in relief and acting on them you create results. Those actions create results. Those particular results may not be what you say money but they create results that then change the choices that are right in front of you. And when you do this consecutively the entire set of choices in your life changes and if money is what you will need to continue to express yourself most fully you will lead into a series of choices where the most exciting choice will be lucrative. But not by denying your excitement where it is obvious and evident and always doing something else other than that excitement. You open the door to who you are by taking the first step. By seeing the thing that is exciting not placing conditions that it must make money leaving yourself open for the fact that the money would be nice. But committing yourself in action to that thing and allowing it to produce a result. That result produces a new choice generally speaking. Those new choices will most often lead to what you call that type of abundant expression money. But by not being willing to take the first step you never produce the result that allows you to see the changing choices. So I understand when you are seeking to me from the position of not having taken that step it may seem that what excites you will never make you money. But I remind you what you are fundamentally talking about rather than putting it in terms of money is support. Often you will refer to this as support from the universe because you externalize the idea of where the support comes from. And you will understand that in doing things that don't excite you you can support yourself or the universe supports you. And will then for some strange reason assume that what does excite you what is an expression of who you are could possibly support you any less. When in fact most literally it can only support you more because support is simply creating the continued ability to do those things. You do what you need to do when you need to do it effortlessly. And so we are back to the idea of being willing to even entertain. If you wish to choose to play it as a game the exciting things from where they are obvious, from where you are sitting right now acting upon them with integrity which is mindful of what you call your agreements with others. For if they are an expression of you and you have an agreement with them you understand that the integrated approach is to honor or renegotiate but not ignore you will find that these things will be productive. Sometimes they may simply seem and I am being facetious and saying simply to produce joy to produce feeling good which then puts you in the frame of mind to choose from the next set of steps perhaps squirrels. I am really good at that you know and I do understand what I am saying. Do you understand the idea that what is causing the confusion for you is not having taken the steps to simply see. The bottom lines you are going to do something. If you choose and it is according to obligation and perhaps you can say lack of joy and commitment you know you will get some type of response. What you do not know and what you have not allowed yourself to experience is the results of allowing your reality to be obvious in that the things that stand out are the most efficacious thing even if they do not seem on the surface to be and this is where paradox enters into it. Many times the thing that excites you in a moment may actually seem counterproductive. If you can act on that with integrity it will not be counterproductive. If you find that you cannot act on it with integrity then there is your sign that perhaps it would be. So the integrity acting on it with integrity is the key is the distinction. Proceed. By the way some individuals simply think that this is too good, too joyous to be true but that is a decision as well. You are going to choose. You are going to decide anyway I am this person you are going to trust that decision whether you make it consciously or not and you are going to act you are going to produce a result and so no matter what happens you are going and have always been and are continuing to use the mechanism we are speaking. By factoring in who you are, who you know yourself to be, your passion, your inspiration, your commitment, how logically or conceptually could that possibly result in a diminished return? Well. I think what she is talking about especially is the built in belief structures in our society which is so strong and are constantly reinforced. Well thank you but do understand that all they are again are not the voices that talk to you but they are the choices that you shoot and decide. So when you say to me well societal beliefs you are attracting your notion of societal beliefs and then you are either deciding to embody those beliefs or not. For again I remind you a belief is not something that you have. I have this belief and I do not have the opposite belief and looking at belief that way is very limiting and makes it quite difficult to change your belief. Again more accurately you are infinite and contain it all so you contain all beliefs, every single belief and its opposite and the result you get is according to which of those beliefs you express and this is where conscious decision, trust and action allows you to express your beliefs consciously according to preference with your own sense of discernment factored in. Anytime you seem to fulfill the prophecy of everyone knows whatever it is that everyone knows you decide they must be right. Does that make sense? It is using your power in a way that feels disempowered but believe me you never know or give it away because there is nowhere to give it to. Well I feel that with what you were talking about before that I could have said moments and moments deciding what excites me. And acting upon it. The action phase is essential to see the change because of your consciousness and the way that it is focused. It would appear that it is essential so it is not merely the discernment it is the action seeing what excites you and acting on it with integrity. Putting out always produces a result and that is the productivity. Well I feel like I said I feel that I am good at death but I don't feel like I am good at this main purpose kind of thing that we talk about. You know the main purpose. Oh what is it when I ask you? What is it that excites you the most of anything that you can think of right now? I think spiritual growth and spiritual. Oh I assume when you expand as a spiritual being however you will be doing something. You will be somehow expressing that expansion in some way in one of the particular ways that your society allows. What thing that you can do excites you the most. In other words when you are already that spiritual being which by the way you are what is it you will do? What is it you see your ideal self do to remove it for observation. I don't like to say so many things. They are the one that seems to stand out as most exciting. Absolutely not. It would defeat the purpose entirely and yes I could but I will not. I really can't think of one. The name several. For the purpose of again demonstration name three things that are very overwhelmingly exciting to you. Going on journey in my mind with animals. Oh what number two? The starting number three. Reading or writing. Two of the things that you name spring at least to my understanding as things which do literally allow you to make money upon your planet what you call writing what you call gardening. And so therefore even in but being willing to take but a moment of your time and you can certainly go more into this if you are willing to open up to yourself in your own private space. You will see that many of the things that you offer up for reasons that what excites you cannot. And so I am really speaking of the things that you name the idea of mind journey we would factor out. Now not in terms of the fact that we are saying do not do this by all means it brings you joy but that is not truly what we mean when we say action. That can be a way to enjoy yourself by all means and will also be productive but because there is nothing you can do about it except perhaps lie down in your bed. The other two would be better examples gardening writing. And in fact there are as you say opportunities upon your planet to even make money in what you call reading. So it depends on what degree you are willing to define what excites you lay it out on the table look at the possibility. When you find one thing that truly excites you the most that you can immediately take an action and do something about it because one of the choices in the moment would be to act upon them. If it is by all means do that thing that is your arrow that is your signpost. Though if it is not immediately available say for instance you choose writing and there is no pen and paper available and you cannot get one immediately. You can push that aside understanding that it is very exciting to you but realizing that there is a unique choice in the moment that will actually enable you to do the writing later that is important in fact an important prerequisite to doing the writing right now and so it still comes back to being mindful of the most exciting thing but if you are not able to act on it in the moment being willing to act on what is available as being most exciting with integrity producing a result and then looking at your next set of choices choosing something doing it then looking at the next set of choices and again many of the actions that you perform that have a result will then provide new choices. All this is is an alternative approach using a mechanism you already embody and live in every given moment. Do you feel that you deserve what excites you? Then all the factors are in place if you are willing to but factor in one more thing and that is you are excited. Does something else come up or is this a system? No this is a separate system. You don't sound that excited about it. And in fact being excited about excitement itself is a very positive first step. Now that you roll around if you will and if something else comes up as being a question by all means time in. Alright? I thank you. Shitting. Nice, my ails. Well learned. As you. Good day. Greetings. Who knows me better than anyone else? I assume that is only half the sentence. You know it's much better than anyone else. I think that in all of creation as I created who knows me better than me. I guess it's just me but I heard you say that and it really excited me. All of that. I thought that in all let's say earth lives that I have lived aren't those kind of hanging out and knowing all. You even said it yourself a little while ago was the last person that you knew what excites her but you wouldn't you know it gives us something. Well the idea is that I allow myself in the way that I present my consciousness to be aware of certain choices. When I interact with you in this form however I by my own decision and choice will allow your words to speak more loudly because that is your action your expression how you choose to express yourself and so I honor that without contradicting. But the idea is it would have been defeating in that case in that sense to tell her what excites her for what I am fostering what I am looking to encourage is the idea of trusting your own sense of discernment and your own excitement. So who knows you better than yourself? Who? You have to ask me first day. Oh what? Is that your only question for you have answered it splendidly. I don't know the answer what was the answer. I know it was me. I know that. I know that. Oh what I just wanted to second with that you're right it was a question that I guess I was placing out that myself for some reason maybe I could back show. So who knows you more than you know yourself? If you say I don't know I will say third base. Oh who is that? We have an unusual profile and you're you. I know you. I'm doing that today actually. It took me a moment to understand that. So yeah I know me. I know me the best and I trust completely in that knowingness. Congratulations do you trust you? The expression of trusting yourself is to honor your excitement and act upon it with integrity for that is the ultimate expression of self validation and willingness to express yourself consciously as a gift to the universe which is only you anyway. I understand that. Thank you. You just did. You just did. Would you like to ask one more? Sorry. Next. Rookie. No. I didn't want to ask you about shifting your system quite a little bit about when beings are not just including humans animals on the planet here decide to leave their bodies we all dying. By the way transform the focus of your consciousness from being pin-point to being more expanded where you realize that your body existed within your consciousness and not the other way around. That is more accurately an explanation of the mechanism. You do not leave the body for you do not in that sense inhabit it to begin with and there is nowhere that you can put the body that is outside of yourself anyway. Yes. So these expressions these vehicles that we express. Oh my god. These vehicles that we express. We honor the dead body and that is my question is from your perspective what is it that we are asking of ourselves when we honor the body we return it to the earth. The spirit I want to know about what is going on with the spirit. Again the spirit is simply an expansion to realize the reality that you previously believe yourself to exist within actually exists within you. The ritual that you are discussing is a different matter and has many different meanings according to the reasons and individuals who are doing such a thing. So the individual who. Oh absolutely. Well specifically the other night Ali and I were coming home and we found a cat that has just gotten hit in my car just probably moments before and it really moved us. So we stopped we scooped up this cat in a bag. It is pretty gruesome but something drove us to get over the gruesomeness of this body to say we need to honor this body. That is simply again a reflection of what we are discussing allowing everything to be all one thing treating it with the respect of the understanding of the integration of all things. That healthy let's call evolution of that cast soul let's say for instance. Perhaps not literally in the way that you mean although it does in that sense add on to your own understanding of yourself. And so therefore perhaps you can say adds to the energy of the soul of the cat but that is quite random. Right I took it and expanded our awareness of the beyond the physical I guess. Innocent can you not understand that in doing that in seeming to have this external honoring that you are in fact simply honoring yourself and your place in the universe. Right through the expression of another being the symbol. Not you can say treating another which is just you in the way that you wish to be treated. Honoring yourself. I let you treat someone else with the respect that you demand you are actually honoring yourself in the process. Yeah okay because each symbol also you can use that kind of dead bird today and it is very powerful to me. And the problem with the honor in this bird is calling this should be more dishing maybe that excites me. Perhaps it does. Actually I get a lot of powerful energy out of the really weird. It's a bad part. But it's like feathering you know I like it and I think there's nothing about it that's really exciting. Well at this point if you allow societal notions to creep in you may judge yourself for that. However if you are willing to honor yourself you can simply see where that will lead and rise to the challenge of seeing how you can express this excitement with integrity. Right. Okay. I thank you. Shutting. Come on. Too many. I have an integration and I want to work with an integrated way. Four. That's one option. With fascination. Oh one. An excitement. Oh I have an endometriosis and I've had it for about five years and in a calf they want to do surgery and all this other stuff. And I can't seem to get in touch with, well I should have done, I have worked on some of the police. But I'm consciously how did I, I don't know how I paid it. And if I actually understand that you maintain the creation of things in your reality because as we have said you create yourself in the moment 100% anew. Now when you make the decision in the moment I am this person if you bring into it the idea that I am this person with this condition from the other decision yesterday then there can again be this apparent. So my suggestion is to begin in the most foundational and fundamental way in deciding who you are in terms of also expressing yourself not as being not sick but as being whole and healthy. Where the emphasis is not upon sickness but is upon expressing yourself integratively, wholely. How do I help? Do not apologize. For lack of better terminology. Being willing to continue to allow yourself to give birth to new ideas and expressing them fully without holding back, without squelching who you are and you know what I mean when I say this will also allow you to get into the body posture to not express that idea since it is to some degree symbolic of that idea. When you decide who you are you can also factor in your physical wholeness and in doing so you recreate yourself since your body is an expression that exists within your consciousness it is extremely alright completely responsive to your consciousness. And so therefore rather than harping on why did I do this to myself which is really just harping on doing this to myself, doing this to myself, doing this to myself you can simply realign with alright that is who I had expressed myself to be that was built into my decision but now hold and expressing myself fully and health fully is part of my decision so be mindful of that as well in being specific. I guess what I was saying is if I had a nervous condition I wouldn't drink caffeine because I made a conscious choice to be a healthy person that's not kind of acknowledging that I have a problem with caffeine or something and I would take the action. So the way that this translates and relates to what we are saying is again the idea of being more willing to fully express yourself with other individuals not withholding, not cordoning off or sectioning off parts or ideas or expressions of yourself and only presenting part of the whole face. Do you understand? I'm working with integrity. But I have to say that I have been asking my universe because I can hear you of my integrity and I can hear from the other change integrity but I have to be able to feel it. I can still hear you talk about it. But we have discussed this to some degree and even in that sense allowed you to create for yourself that feeling even in one of our interactions do you recall. So it is that simple. I have done nothing but reflect back to you who you are. So thank you. Ah! This timing we will pause for a short break the length of which to be determined by you and resume contact at that time.
