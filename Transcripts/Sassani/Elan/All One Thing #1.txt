 Alright, how are you all this evening of your time as you create time to exist? Are you all alive? Thank you very much. We will begin with this or act since this evening of your time. We will once again be the idea that everything is all one thing. We have said this to you many times before, that everything you do perceive as separate objects, separate people, separate beings are all but a manifestation of one thing. Now, manifesting in a multitude of ways, allowing itself in the sense to provide the idea of self-reflection for you cannot truly reflect on who it is that you are from one perspective. You must make a separation and in a sense then allowing yourself to walk outside of yourself and look back in. Very many of your ideas that you have separated down to the idea of separate things are indeed but again manifestations of one thing. An example we will give you this evening of your time is what you have labeled within your society cause and effect. You do perceive that cause is separate from effect to a specific aspect or idea. In fact, they are only separate in appearance as one side of your coin is separate in a sense from the other side of your coin. However, it is and if any real overall sense is one coin and therefore the idea of cause and effect are but one thing. Therefore, it is not necessarily as you might have imagined and as you have created from time to time in your society that because must come first. That in and of itself is just a definition. The idea is that being two sides of the same coin either may occur first chronologically. One of the ideas we have observed within your society is the idea that in order to be as you say happy you must have A, B and C. And on behalf of you we have that are not inherently happy. Oh, when we only achieve this idea of that idea then we will be happy. What we will present to you this evening of your time is that that is only one way in which to you this idea. Another way is that you can first create the effect if indeed you do create the effect of happiness in your life first. And this does mean realizing what if you were happy using your imagination now you would be like how would you act how would you carry yourself how would you interact with others. And then as you say act that way shall we say being two sides of the same coin that now that you have created that effect in your life you are now leaving yourself shall we take the opening for the cause of that effect. In other words if you do choose within your choices within your reality to simply act and be happy now then the causes of that happiness will accelerate into your life as you say very quickly. Therefore as we have said again many in your society strive to be able to work and struggle and do what it is that you feel will as you have coined in your society pay your dues in order to then have excitement in your life. What you may do is begin now this very moment from the choices that are available to you right now to use what does excite you as the criteria for choosing in any given moment. Therefore beginning now to do what excites you and not waiting as you have in your society till you can so really speak save up enough money to retire. That example which we have also used from time to time we observe does not in practice actually yield the results you always desire for if you do spend 50 to 60 of the years of your life span struggling and striving. And then as you say earn the ability to retire and have fun and excitement you haven't had much practice having fun and excitement and very often what you then do create is a feeling of uselessness instead of enjoying the harvest you have been waiting for your entire life. So what we are now suggesting is to begin to have excitement now getting practice you will find that what you have made the goal can be the road what you have made the destination can be the path. And by doing what it is that does excite you in any given moment not necessarily the thing that excites you the most in your life but what again of the choices available to you at any given moment does excite you. Then you are also attracting by virtue of the fact that you are being mostly and truly yourself your true poor being for that is why an idea does excite you all the abundance that you do need. Another idea that we will touch upon at this time is the idea of abundance for within your society you have labels that in order to be abundant many of you have wable shall we say that in order to be abundant you must have a lot of money. This is one of the symbols you have chosen to create in your life we are not invalidating it is a valid symbol and in fact may be a reflection of abundance. However our definition of abundance is slightly different points are not placed as you say the parameters around this idea that you have our definition of abundance is simply doing that. Doing what you need to do when you need to do it. There is. Therefore this as you say provide a appropriate segue to the idea that we will discuss of allowing. If you allow realizing that definition of abundance what you need to do when you need to do it what you need to have when you need to have your abundance to manifest in any way that it will. Accepting your abundance in any way that it does come not that you will only accept it that way only accept it as month but you accept it in whatever form it does come in your life. Real idea you are deserving of all the joy and ecstasy that you can't even happen. Then you will find that you will vibrate as a being who does unconditionally accept abundance. When you say I will accept all the abundance I can have as long as it comes in dollar bills shall we say you are vibrating as a being who does not unconditionally accept abundance. Therefore being that you can only have the reality you want to vibrational. Of course it is logical that the universe will not provide abundance to you unconditionally. Therefore by again acceptance of your abundance that's right to force or make something occur in a particular way but by accepting it as you are already created you do add action only and it says change your vibration to that of one who does unconditionally accept abundance. Then the universe provides unconditional abundance to you many kinds of ways you will not expect very often almost always within what you consider coincidence not meaning something which is extraneous but co-incidence things, incidents, co-opety at the same time all connected for again it is part of the fact that everything is all one thing. Therefore in extrapolating this idea of allowing of acceptance if you will but allow yourself to glean from any situation that appears in your life. Hey positive meaning for realize you create your own reality 100% even if you create the apparent thing that is out of your control that is still your creation. If you will realize that nothing within your reality is extraneous is a deviation from a path but part of the path that you are then you can clean the reason you have created the situation in the first place. Very many times you create what you perceive to be negative situation because of the belief systems you have been spoon fed from shall we say your child but this is just a definition made by you perpetuated by you at any given time when you choose to accept what you have created and glean that you must have created this for a reason and as well as the fact that you can't believe any negative things from a given occurrence there are always some positive aspects something that that situation will allow you to do that you could not have formally done once you start to give your thinking with this type of truck and allow these symbols in your quiet to deliver the messages you have created them forth then they do not seemingly for nothing ever really does but seemingly repeat themselves. We have lowered very many times in your society the idea of repetitive negativity in your life from our perspective being that we understand that the present is not a result of the path that you do create the path from the present. That anything within your life that seems to be repetitive each and every time it does because in the first time and when you see realizing that everything is fundamentally neutral you give it the label that is the effect that you get out of it the label you give it for that determines your actions when you do see these giving the same meaning to what you can feel to be a repetitive symbol and clean again the reason for the presentation your reality to yourself from yourself of that symbol then you allow it to transform and this is how you can begin to take what you perceive to be negativity and allow it to deliver its message and be on its way very often you are giving yourself a message which once you realize what the message is you also realize there are many ways to have the same effect without creating that scenario and then when you do cut yourself that black from shall we say a more positive action there is no need for that quote negative symbol to quote reappear. So again acceptance of abundance as it comes allowing others to be of service to you if somebody does offer you something expect it accept the abundance do not think you don't deserve it do not think you are pulling something over on the other person do not think you are taking advantage that idea in and of itself implies lack of these other abilities simply realize that when you do accept a gift of any sort from another that you are being observed as to them by allowing them to be absurd to you how are you following along hello thank you therefore the idea of accepting shall we say is cheap before we do open up this interaction for sharing for questions and answers and statement we shall illustrate using an analogy we have illustrated the idea of the apanity of separation the idea of the apanity of difference when in fact everything is all one thing and here is the analogy you have a you say a propeller spinning at a certain rate if you do have what you label strobe light and you do think for an eye that strobe light to the propeller so that it's blinking one time for each revolution of the propeller recognize this idea the choice of timing of turning on your stroke will determine the position that you do see the propeller in it will also determine the only position that you see the propeller in it if you are able to have many individuals in a room viewing that same propeller and were able to have non-indepreative strobe light so that everybody can separate and timing of their own strobe without shall we say it's appearing with the others then have each individual that very is tiny for turning on their strobe they will each see the same propeller the same one thing in a different position from one another each only believing if they use the creative that way that there is the only position that the propeller is actually in and the timing and rate of that strobe will determine the individual perception of that strobe therefore we submit to you that your reality your perception of your reality is simply the timing and rate by which you do create your consciousness therefore viewing the same one thing from many different aspects and reaching the experience and reaching the discoveries each and everyone creating his own entire reality yet at the same time the ability to share as you say some degree of commonality far less than you might imagine however a seemingly all commonality therefore again as we did start this delineation we submit to you that everything is made of one thing of all that is of the life of God or all that is as we do call it and that like if attached to an emotionality that emotionality would be what you label in your society ecstasy therefore you are all made of ecstasy therefore in our appreciation for your willingness to share with us your version of that ecstasy and allowing us to share with you our version and in a very real sense choosing to allow us to walk in the same dream as you and recognize if you as a group as a society did not vibrate within the ideas that we speak to you all we would not in fact be able to communicate with you there would be no commonality therefore in appreciation for your willingness to realize that you just may transform your life you just may deserve all the joy and ecstasy that you do design we ask you now how may I be a service to you said yes I have a question one moment please speak up and be bold so all may share and that will provide the clear reflection of who you are which is in fact the most service you can provide to another I have a question about one specific thing we're trying to sell these properties and we seem to be stuck with it it's not moving are you saying that by acting as if it is already done we should be packing it up assuming that it's already sold and therefore it will then be sold and then the idea is that first of all even your wording of the situation implies that rather than selling a property as you say you are trying to sell a property we simply suggest to assume the posture of selling it as you say spending all your time of the doing of trying but also the idea is this have clean intention I do desire to sell this property then go about your life in any given moment doing only that which is trying to within integrity the idea that we just got to do last evening of the old time integrity as it regards to the idea of integration the recognition that everything is all one thing and therefore you do not have to force yourself or your viewpoint upon an office by acting in this manner you will coincidentally lead yourself into just a certain status that will not only as you say sell your property but in a much and a most truthful and synchronous manner in other words also you not in fact as you say a motionality behind the fact that it is not selling realizing if you have the clean intention for it to sell and do what excites you that it will sell and not that someone else has turned down buying the property over here it is not selling for that is a constant reinforcement that is not selling does that help that help tremendously can we clarify it anybody yeah you think you can you're a test so if there's doubt that I truly want to sell the house then that will cloud or home what's happening in a very real sense yet it will allow you the opportunity to reflect your as you say motivation and you may very well find you do desire to sell that house if they don't as you say residual doubt when you do allow them to come to your conscious awareness and integrate them shall be saying you will be a bit surprised that you'll come quickly and enthusiastically it will sell that is one of the idea of what may as you say hold it back from that so take the opportunity to reflect in this manner but also and we thank you have given up the opportunity to lay down something we have laid down but we will reiterate at this time and at run in we have labeled I V up I clear intention the clear definition desire and deserved ability and a clear action these are the most direct way to as you say very quickly manifest your reality but it is conducive to look at each aspect of what you call that formula therefore do you have clear intention on selling the property would be the first step then clearly define all the possibilities that are available to you in that moment clearly define what you can now initiate not worrying about down the line we perceive that also you would look at the idea of your desire do you fully desire to do so somewhat as in how much you are clear to attention also deserve ability do you deserve to manifest the life of all the joy and ecstasy that you can have and therefore all these details will by definition take care of themselves but lastly clear action what is available to you at any given moment along those lines if there is nothing available to you at a given moment that seems to facilitate the selling of your property by choosing from the possibility that is not the ability to be available to you that which excites you paradoxically that is the shortest way to sell the property even though because of your experience of timing you may not see it remember everything is all one thing it is all into related one of the other aspect of shows into experience in your reality is timing and timing generally has the overtone of not having something creating a space of time and then having it that is the mechanism for discovering you do impose upon yourself forgetfulness and then evenly discover something and now an actuality you are remembering what you already knew but you have chosen to experience the idea of discovery therefore you impose upon yourself a forgetfulness and timing is one of the aspects you are exploring by choosing to experience this reality does that answer the question perfectly thank you very much shit don't be shy how can I get my manuscript published? define your manuscript not my manuscript I was just a channel by what you came through how can I get it out of the public realize a it is your own manuscript even if you have you say facilitated communication from another being it is still coming through you therefore you cannot in a sense remove yourself from its creation if you were not the vibrations you accept that your creation you would not have therefore putting you squarely within create a ship of the manuscript have you as you say submitted your own manuscript to many publishers realize in your society the acropensity for many of what you call your best-selling novel have been as you say rejected by publishing as much as 40 to 15 of your time the aspect that has set apart the individuals who have put 16 is their willingness to realize that those quote rejections are part of the process and not an interruption in it very often musicians as you say upon your society who do make record album also have that same reality the ones who do as you say make it or the ones who have hung in there how many submissions have you made for it we suggest that you realize that if your clear intention is to have that manuscript published and when deciding what to do about it you do pick what excites you of the possibility you will see again a very quick acceleration of that process and again for this also applies to this idea you may choose to view a quote rejection as a neutral situation therefore you have the choice do I wish to view this rejection as an invalidation of the word of my project or do I view this rejection as an affirmation to myself that no matter what anybody says I still feel it has worked that way the rejection has been absurd to you but it has allowed you to embark upon a step in self-discovery and self-affirmation and the idea of persistence is something you believe does that help? Yes it does thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Yes. I'd like to learn more about conscious commandments. Yes. Could you explain that a little bit to us? Conscious commandments is simply the idea that it is so because I say it is so and therefore acting that way. One of the things in your society and we will not make a lengthy dissociation as you say on the idea but is that you have created the idea within your society that process, take time or difficult must be repeated over and over again must affirm this idea of 3,437 times before it will sink into my consciousness and then all right that is the reality however that like anything else is simply a definition, a belief system and other belief system is it is that simple. And upon choosing to adopt that belief system that it is that simple then changing a belief is as simple as simply realizing your old belief, wording your new belief, boldly stating your new belief and proceeding in action as though it is already so that is conscious commandments. Thank you very much. Sure. Yes. I'm not going to be serious about this person. I'm just going to ask you to ask a question. Thank you very much. Oh, as you say, you in conscious communication with that being. We suggest that you may be all the time simply by the idea of allowing yourself when embarked within these communications to not invalidate what you get. Do not say to yourself, oh, it is only quote only me. Therefore validating the information that does come through. This is the way we have suggested within your society that anybody does as you say and have called this channel. By simply not invalidating what comes through when you are in a receptive state, you then 45 and strength and allow that interaction to continue. As far as the gender of that individual, one of the joys of your discovery will be finding out that gender. Therefore, we will not step on the toes of that discovery for you at the timing. However, we will tell you this. You are familiar with that being. You have, as you say, been very intimately involved with that being in what you call other lifetime. Many, many lifetime doing a different dance of relationship. In a very real sense in the state that that being is in right now, one moment, what is, as you say, the amount all month. It's doing so much. Realize when that entity does fully inject itself into the vessel within you. It will be in your terminology, a child. However, until such a time, there is some malleability to this idea and you may view that soul, that entity as shall we say a grown up and communicate to it that way for the forgetfulness that one doesn't pose upon itself when incarnating. Is not why shall we say crystallize yet? Therefore, you may have conversations as an adult, as you say. One moment. That is all we shall say at this time about that idea. Do you have another question? No. Thank you very much. Sure. If you extend on the concept of the child within the relationship of all the persons. Thank you very much. The most relevant, effective way for us to communicate this idea for the you at this time is a follow. We have told you that from our perspective, you do create the path from the present. In your society, one of the ideas that has become shall we say popular in one of the ways that you do in a sense give your power away within your society. It is to use as a symbol, a curve which you did perceive happens to you in your childhood to rationalize your present behavior. But you are creating this in the present. It is not empirically that anything is happening in the past that sticks to you as determines your actions. You recreate this idea each time you do under that idea. How you may work with this idea is to realize that you are creating that child that you put word in the present. Therefore, you can recreate that child from the present. Therefore, if you are away, for instance, that you do not desire and you perceive that it is from something that has happened in your childhood, you may now realize how you desire to be. Realize how the child would have to do with that in order for you to now be as you desire to be. Under the Yours, meditative state, recreate that aspect of the childhood. In this way you may use this as a convenient and powerful tool to take back your responsibility. In a way you may call it very loosely, retroactive, re-manifestation. Does that answer the question? Very well, thank you. Thank you very much. Do you have another question? No, it's a moment. Thank you. Sure. Yes, you are. All right. One moment. The boy sounds a million, but we have not heard you in quite some time. I know. I've been away when I was in Minnesota and recreating a lot of childhoods, a lot of half, having a lot of fun. Very exciting. I did not allow you to feel very validated. Did you find that you did in fact recreate your childhood? Yes. Did you find that when comparing your ideas of your childhood to others that quote, grew up with you's idea of your childhood that they did different greatly? Yes. Can you then see there is no background childhood reality? Simply that which each individual does now perpetuate as their perception of what reality was? Yes. Thank you. Rosie? That's one of the aspects of the trip is that also in my being a reflection of who I was, two others, it allowed them to then look at their own perception of what their childhood was. They turn it to positive aspects themselves. Very good. Thank you for reinforcing our last ideas. Yes. So one of the things that I did too was be able to spend a lot of time with my nephews. They had a lot of fun communicating on the Ouija board and having fun with things you taste. They had questions about how you plan a book and how you look and do you read and things like that. I'm sure that you're better than sound in particular. Could you just like give a brief description of yourself and plan it for them? Thank you very much. We are all residing as you say, as you are physical beings upon a planet. We have names as Sasani. We are Sasani. The people are Sasani which means living life. Thus, Sasani does mean place of living life and thus we have named our planet. Our planet is, as you say, orbiting around a central star which is greenish, yellow, and converse. And a bit of degree parrot as you say than your son. Therefore, our planet is a bit further away from our son than yours. Therefore, our year where your year is. 365 and approximately one quarter, days for your planet to go around as you say your central star one time, hours. You consist of what you were labeled. 454 of what you were considered to be your day. Your day is 24 hours. Our day is close to that idea of 25 hours. Your planet has to it a slight tilt to its axis. Our planet does not have such a tilt and therefore we do not create the idea as you do all seasons. Therefore, it is essentially a moderate planet. Would not be unpleasant with a few adjustments your society would be able to exist upon it. It is very oxygen rich as you say. So for a time you may be a little wide-headed. We, the beings upon our planet, are five approximately five of your feet in height. White, gray, skin, coloration. The males have no hair. Females have hair. Usually white. The idea is our eyes, which are our more. Our belong and shall we say, glances in your old, gray, and coloration. Our people's eyes take up most of our lives and therefore you would perceive our lives as being black but they are not. An analogy we have used that is most appropriate to what you call a civilization on your planet that we most closely resemble would be the race of Mongolia. Although not exactly. You have upon your planet, many drawings and sketchings of your ideas of extraterrestrial with very long thin faces, flariated black eyes. We are all very literally a cross section between that idea and your human appearance. Therefore we are more human in appearance than them but more alien in a sense, not from our perspective from your than you. Therefore we at this time upon our planet are undergoing a transformation as you are. Your transformation is from a we have labeled third to fourth density. Third and fourth density are both physical dimensions where you still are a physical being. Once you get to and realize these are arbitrary labels and not a periodically existing as such but when you get to fifth density, then the beginning of non-physicality is initiated. Our planet while your is transforming from third to fourth is transforming from fourth to fifth. Therefore we are still physical but less and less so. Much of the idea that you have called eating or injection of substance for nourishment is, shall we say, a bit this digital from time to time for certain reasoning, one may partake of a physical injection but that is far less the idea now in our society. Fourth we are in the midst of what you will label energy exchanges and therefore we do absorb our energy much more directly in a sense you might say through the skin, in a sense and therefore the symbol that we have out of eating is rare occurrence. Is that another question that you have on the line? Not particularly long ago. You have another question? Well, yes. The other day Andrew and I were working with my family. My mom playing. And I didn't have to pray to block. You will know in terms of taking that leap of faith into deep transplant challenge and I realized that at the point where I put my focus too much time, the challenge section. Now what will you do to transform the situation since you are a very nicely weighed down to us? I just want to share with you that I have said I now understand that your my attention is to open up my communication so it's not just related to my family when I'm in the process of channeling. Thank you very much by removing the label and stigma you have attached within your belief systems of that label. You will find that simply by relaxing, breathing, allowing and doing you will transform this idea. Recognize each and every one of you have the ability if you desire you do not have to channel. We have provided a stream in a sense of our attention that is constantly in a sense being to your planet and each and every one of you have access to that stream to use in whichever way the rate and Therefore, any offer again, realize that your definition that channeling must entail a certain process. I know it must. Are you ready to book? Is must. Is a definition, but it can be as we have said that simple. If we do it simply allow and accept what does come simply realize that it first is maybe you, but by validating yourself when you begin such a process, you become the vibration of validation and therefore as open that order to whatever it is you desire, whatever is yours clear intention. Therefore, we give you the advice that we give many go right ahead and you have been doing it anyway. What you have labeled almost doing it from our perspective is doing it and invalidating it. Thank you very much. Are you true? Thank you. Thank you. I have other compulsive behaviors that seem to accelerate when I wonder a lot of stress and for now, it's sometimes amusing, but I find it personally is boxing not being able to. I don't know if the words control or I don't feel as though I can maintain my environment, but rather my environment maintains me. All right. And the second part of that question is that my moment. What was the first part? First part is how do I transform this compulsive behavior? One moment. What is it from your perspective? Your perspective that you consider within your actions to be at your level compulsive? And what is compulsive about it? Compulsive behavior to me is feeling that you have to do something in order to feel okay to feel at peace with yourself and not doing that action simply for the pleasure of doing it or the excitement of doing it, but rather doing it because you feel compelled to do it so that you can get on to the next thing. One moment. Therefore, what you want to say is to some degree, you still have a trust and a reality that doing what does excite you at any different moment will not yield the reality you desire. That's true. And you are, shall we say, invested in the idea that there are the idea which we do not feel there is empirically of should there are no should you create your reality. Therefore, you decide if something you have the opportunity to do does excite you or not. The only thing that quotes perpetuates for it is anew every time not the same behavior over and over again, but the idea that you are being compulsive is your lack of willingness to do what excites you. Healthy. The other aspect of that is that I feel I have the consideration or I'd like to change that consideration that as a wife and a mother, I have a responsibility to fulfill other people's needs as well as my own. All right, we have spoken to you many times about the idea of responsibility, not being responsible for someone for you cannot be responsible for someone, but being responsible to someone by being responsible for yourself. Not a new idea to you at all. If we allow it to have some applicability in your life, when these issues do, as you say, come up, remember these ideas provide the truest reflection if you are of who you are in any given situation. And you are being maximally responsible to another individual in any given situation. You may also find that you have, as you say, clearly bones of contention, taking things that do indeed excite you to do, but once somebody else has come along and tell you to do the thing that you decide does excite you, you will not do it because nobody will tell you what to do. If you are happy with whom that type of confront the toll reality to. Does that help? Yeah. Do you have another question? I find that relationship are sometimes difficult, person-wise relationships in that you may have my hear what your reality is. And another person may have a different perspective, like your analogy would be a papillosan. And so how do you, even though we are all the same, but yet we are separate, how do you integrate your reality, say with your, your makes reality, so that everything works? Thank you. First, we realizing that it is the same propeller. Secondly, accepting the relationship as it is, we need from it what you can positively from what you have labeled negative circumstance, thereby allowing those to transform. When you do have a certain, as you say on your planet, on a human, rather than the obvious, what makes you miserable about that idea, attempt to clean what has huge before busy or obvious, which can be just as much the obvious. What is this allowing me now to do? What must I still be believing to participate in this reality? I realize one other thing. If you are creating upset within a relationship and assigning the responsibility of that upset to your, as you say, makes, realize the only way you can manifest upset in your reality is for you to manifest it. From your interpretation of a neutral symbol, thereby then acting with the definition you are giving it and if that is negative, yielding and negatively reality. So again, in a situation where, in your own life, up till now, you would not have done so, simply take a few deep breaths and ponder what you are getting out of it. Not what you are getting out of it. That is obvious. You understand? Does that help? Yes, very much so. Thank you. Please feel free when applying these principles. Should you choose this? We won't force you to have too much time to report back to us and share the worst ability of these ideas in your reality. For we have to time and time again. We do not expect anybody to believe what we all say because we are saying it. We do guarantee however that if you do apply these ideas within your life, I 100% guarantee they will work, but only you can prove it. In fact, the big reason we are interacting in this way with you now, instead of as you say, face to face, then flows the idea of that, we, what is taught about you up? It's to convey to you the information, the message, and which, if you wish, that you do clean this message for face value, for what it is, for what it can do. Not because some aliens from face told me we have spoke that we will in fact meet with you one day, face to face. When you do view yourself as we view you, we do you as our equal. However, you generally speaking, consentually speaking, do not view us as an equal. You do in some sense, place us and other entities above you. We do not wish to interact in this manner. It is not our desire to have you say land upon your plan and have as you say, individuals in your society fall to their means. No. In our desire to share with you as equal, as one self-empowered race to another self-empowered race. We have noticed the propensity in your society to latch on to the message and throw the message out the window. We do not desire this within these communications. Therefore, it is always worth up to you to believe or not to leave these ideas. They are not empirically true because they come from us. However, our observations of individuals in your society that have begun to glean this information and apply it in their life. Shall we say they have yield in a reality directly proportional to their applicability? If, for instance, you do apply these principles, these principles of mechanics, these basic principles, not just philosophy, any percent, you will get a yield of that kind of reality. So it is proportional to your willingness to live in such a way. But we will not force upon you these ideas simply present them. Realizing that if you are even here to perceive these ideas, they do in some way apply to you. You are able in some way to apply them. Therefore, we again thank you for allowing us to interact with you in this manner. For as little as what you say tends of the order years ago, we would not, as if we were not able to have these types of interactions. For mass consciousness, there was not enough of this type of vibration within your society. But because you have chosen to experience a transformation of life, the rate of which individuals are. Shall we say turning over to these ideas, accepting the possibility that they just may create their own reality, even in part, although we realize it to be one hundred percent little, you do now give us the opportunity to communicate with you in this fashion. Otherwise, we would have been far too early into you, you far too early into us to have an interaction of this nature. But again, the final analysis is up to you. This is why we communicate in this fashion for in order to believe the material when it is in part to you. And this fashion shall we say you must really believe it because it rings true with you.
