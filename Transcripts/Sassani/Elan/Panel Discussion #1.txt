 Greetings, proceed as you wish. We're going to ask for a brief one to two minutes opening comment from each of our three panel members and if we could start with you alone. All right, thank you and welcome. My particular shall I say perspective upon this is simply this. What you call extraterrestrial life, at least as far as I am concerned, is quite non-interference in nature. Perhaps you can say we have a code of non-interference as some of you have heard of in some of your list for a show. The idea is that we respect the sovereignty of your ability to create your reality and we respect the sovereignty of what you call your free will. The unconditional love of what you call God, what we call all that is, allows you to explore anything that you wish and since this is an unconditional love, you cannot lose it by doing something wrong. Now, you absolutely seem to be able to create to lose your own love, but all that is loves you no less, no matter what you do. And therefore, you are allowed in that sense free will means that you can explore positive, you can explore negative, though you also get the results of each exploration. So therefore, it is always up to you when you respect this and therefore our influence will simply be the willingness to allow you to attract our perspective, which you may find to be empowering quite positive, but in no way do we insist that what we are saying is any better than what you are doing. Those will sometimes judge that it is, but it will never be my particular perspective. For every reality is a perfect creation, perfect in whatever exploration it is that you are choosing to embark upon. So therefore, if it is misery, as I have said it is perfect misery. It is perfection. Perfection is not something you need strive for, you are perfectly whatever you are being in any given moment. People therefore your society has crossed the threshold after many tens of thousands of years where our way of life begins to make sense, where when we speak about it or allow channels to translate our consciousness, you are able to understand it. The only reason you are able to understand it is because you contain it already. If you didn't, it would not translate to you. The only reason something makes sense to you, the only reason something rings true with you is because you first contain it and simply remembering this never removes your power from yourself. So my particular extraterrestrial perspective, if you will, is to simply make available the most empowering viewpoint that works for us and our society. But again, never insisting that you are doing anything wrong. It is your life, it is your planet and what you do with it is up to you. Perhaps we would prefer in that sense to see positive choices, positive outcomes, but our love for you as the love of all that is is simply unconditional. One last note before I proceed, what you call history is quite a subjective idea. Or whatever it is you believe your history to be, you then feel that that is your history, you then think that that is your history and you then act as though it is your history. So it is. And the effect in your life is that that is the way history is. But history is truly less of an objective idea than you would understand because once someone perceives it, it becomes quite subjective. And what I am saying is that there are many histories, as many histories in your planet as there are individuals who conjure one up. You only live in the now moment and only recreate a sense of history in the moment. So you may see in your explorations in what you call your conference many different versions of history. And what I am saying though this may unsettle some is that they are all true. And it would be inaccurate to say one is any truer than the other because they work for the individual. And again if you proceed as though that is your history, you have the complete effect of it being your history. So if you are willing to expand your definition to allow for all truths, all history and simply choose which history you prefer or which history rings most true with you, then you will allow yourself to enjoy the fruits of learning from your history without insisting that everyone else have the same history which they will not anyway. So beginning on that note I thank you and therefore pass the baton as you say. Barbara. I am waiting for you. Okay. Oh I am ready to go now. I am going to pass you to Barbara. She long said something that I totally ascribe to and that is that there is only your own version of the world and that is. And all of these versions kind of like bubbles that when you pour bubble bath in a bath as all those bubbles and they make a whole tub of bubbles. Except you create from the core of your being whatever you need to symbolically reflect back to yourself. We have been doing this throughout our own history on this planet. We want to keep defining and defining and defining and agreeing and from what the Pleiadians have taught me we are never going to agree on anything. And that does not bother me and at least I don't want to. I don't want to be with a group of people that all nod their heads and say yes this is it. Because one thing I have learned is that we have uniqueness and we create the reality that continuously pulls us forward. And if you think back from what we have been taught for the last number of years of all through school you see that there were always shocking events. There was always something that someone couldn't possibly believe could be true. And yet once it was integrated it was no big deal you took it for granted. So becoming aware that we are connected to intelligence from someplace else that looks different that is in a different zone of time to me is quite obvious. And yet my encounters with extraterrestrial beings and I have very few in what I would call a direct or physical contact have been shocking and startling to me. And even though I can speak very calmly and coolly about the theory of this experience and my ideas about it when I create a situation to take myself further into experience I have my own stuff to deal with. And I create the extraterrestrial experiences in my life that symbolically means something to me that I grow from. May I add something to this? Eh? Oh thank you. There is a phenomenon that occurs when you physically interact with certain extraterrestrial societies. We in that sense express ourselves to behold beings without partitioning off our consciousness into many forms of sub-super-unconscious and so forth. Therefore we represent ourselves as 100% whole beings. When you come into proximity to a being whose bio-oric field if you will for lack of a better term is such as less gaps is not broken in that sense. The effects of that interaction physically rather than to drive our particular vibration perhaps you can say lower or downward not meaning lesser or worse simply lower vibration would far more be to force your own vibration upward. So therefore though the situation itself may be inherently fearless contain no danger within it. This effect brings up within you the individuals certain things that you perhaps have been denying have been partitioning off. When all of a sudden you are forced to look at things which may have nothing whatsoever to do with up the reaction can be anywhere from mild to very intense fear or to do. So we do not wish in that sense in any way to have this occur therefore we time very carefully these interactions where we are actually conscious of them and we do this for your comfort because we love you not because we are withholding from you. So you may understand this to be part and parcel a particular measure of your particular timing and nothing personal. I am like okay I have been in the pyramid so I am kind of spaced out. All I can really share is my own personal experience on this one because I think we are all in the middle of a deep journey understanding this issue right now because I think all of you are realizing that you are having contests with other dimensions and other awarenesses and the way it worked out for me is that I was very much in touch with the Pleiades the earliest memories I have were four months old and so it goes back to that early and I would imagine it goes back to birth. For some peculiar reason I did not split off my consciousness from the Pleiades and my husband gave me an answer to that very recently. In fact it was it a channel by Barbara Marciniac it was we were in Raleigh and my husband said that after watching me for years he decided that what happens with the Pleiades and this is only one group of extraterrestrials and he said that what happens with the Pleiades is that they have a very special relationship to earth which I have already delineated from a cosmological point of view. In other words we are part of the Pleiades system and so it is another star but it is part of our own system which creates a very special linking with the Pleiades and so my husband said that he noticed that as far as he could tell that the Pleiades came in especially when small children were in trouble. His experience with the Pleiades have been to have what he calls the blue lady come to him when he is in a crisis situation and my husband and I both had very very difficult childhoods in my case I was on had a very abusive childhood and I I believe that what happened with me is I think the Pleiades were with me from the beginning because they were responding to a child that was in crisis and so I don't really feel a separation from the Pleiades and the separation from being on earth and therefore it gives me a little bit of a special perspective because my difficulty in this lifetime was figuring out what earth was and not what the Pleiades was. So since you are earthlings and you understand their earth very well this may resonate with you. I learned about this from earth and what I learned from being on earth what I have learned from being on earth is that the earth is my home and the earth is a place that holds a part of my consciousness a third dimensional part of my consciousness actually a physical body and yet because I didn't separate it out I've carried such a strong sense of my multi-dimensional self that I now feel after my experience of being on earth that we are actually at home in many many places like right now at this conference I'm beginning to find the home in serious and I feel that I probably will develop such a strong connection with serious that I will probably feel as strongly at home there as I do in Alcyon eventually. So I really think that what's going on with extraterrestrial locations not extraterrestrial beings is the extraterrestrial locations all represent a form of consciousness that is part of the one and when I speak of the one as speaking of me and as I sit here Alcyon and wherever else I am in other words each one of us as we sit here we're a consciousness that is one and so therefore that consciousness exists in many other places and as our curiosity about ourselves in the sense of the many develop and it's exploding at this point I feel then what I feel about extraterrestrial beings and Elan may have some response to this I feel what happens with extraterrestrial beings is that when we ourselves begin to feel a need for their consciousness wherever they are located or whoever they are that is when I feel that they're called in for example with the Pleiades I felt a need for that love and compassion to stay in the body because of the degree of abuse that I was experiencing and so I think that because experience on earth can often be so cruel to the child I think that the reason the Pleiades are coming in so strongly is responding I have my husband believes that whatever a child is in trouble on this planet the peace come right down to exist in some way so that's what I have to say at this point. We are very accommodating in that way but the idea is that you do not need us so much as that we simply assist you we understand that you will make your decisions you will make your changes and sometimes may shall I say add perhaps you can say some positive perspective but ultimately we can only be responsible to you and you responsible for yourself in the aforementioned example the idea of any side of the exploration from victimhood perpetrator hood is not a sign in any way of weakness it is a very strong perspective to choose to explore something with such a negative repercussions so we also have a degree of what you would say respect for your strength in making such a decision in terms of being able to express enough strength to be able to partake of that type of experience once you do however you become that much more qualified to assist other individuals upon your own planet in doing so who would perhaps give more weight to someone who had quote unquote been there as well but it is not again that we are doing anything for you simply responding and adding our particular love but we do not feel sorry for you or pity or sympathy as much as compassion which still respects your strength still respects your sovereignty as a being and always understand the strength in which you create these situations we do not look at it as weakness thank you let me start with the question later you all get a chance to ask questions as well there have been many histories written as well as spoken and of course since all histories are true these histories have to be true that talk about in past ages a very major extraterrestrial influences on human transformation especially at critical times in human history and to simplify it is both good guys bad guys things that have made human evolution more enlightened and things that have made human evolution more painful etc. So is there a difference with this current evolution that the earth is in now compared to past stages and if so why and if not what are the similarities between extraterrestrial influences at this place of planetary transformation compared to past places of planetary transformation question clear yeah I this is a great question as far as I'm concerned to ask in Egypt and then when I start taking your questions I'm going to go out and use the key for some frequency because they can give you more information but as far as Egypt is concerned the reason that I enjoy Egypt so much is the other issue with the Pleiadians is that we are the record keepers of this star system and we are very interested in all the records of all the star systems and all of the life forms that exist in the cosmos and Egypt actually has temples and reliefs and various artistic creations which are which excess all of the star systems and so I enjoy Egypt tremendously because in one temple I might feel a connection with one star system or another so I'm not sure exactly what your question would tell me but Egypt for some reason the Egyptians coded the whole country in order to resonate with certain stars and certain energy forms could be picked up. That's a great answer thanks Barbara it wasn't the answer to my question but it was a good answer you may want to pass on the question maybe it's not relevant but the question had to do with are the extraterrestrial influences on the planet now that are influencing planetary transformation and when they influence people they influence planetary transformation as well are they different in nature from at past times of planetary evolution and what's the sort of differences there itself. That's the second half of it I'm tired for being in the pyramid so first of all you have the sense of all of the temples here being encoded with forms which exist the different systems and this whole routine was used in Egypt from the middle of the 18th dynasty and then back into time thousands and thousands of years to keep the star codes active in Egypt the teaching on this related to Egypt is called the teaching of the blue Nile and the teaching of the blue Nile is the methodology by which the Egyptians help the star codes intact in Egypt and then because of a fall and a breakdown on this energy field degenerated in the 18th dynasty however all of the system was created so that it would be then excessive so that it would be accessible now so what is happening at the present time is because the coding still exists in Egypt the various extraterrestrial beings who need to be responding to the earth at this time have a home here so what you're going to be experiencing in Egypt is visiting the homes of all of these different systems. Does that answer to? So in other words they're all coming in now as anybody noticed. Is there a difference of the way they're coming in now and what we're doing then they have in the past? Yes they're incarnating through us and I don't know whether they did this in the past but since 1942 1943 when the atom was split something has occurred on earth in the solar system which makes it possible for any extraterrestrial who wants to incarnate here from another system to come into the system and I don't know what this means all I can say is I'm observing because I'm seeing the consciousness within various humans. May I answer? From a foundational point of view there is a difference in allow me to explain why. Always was the characteristic of being human the same in terms of that you only experience the reality that you are the vibration of. When you in that terms choose to vibrate as a positive being not in denial of the negative however but in acknowledgement of it you will experience and attract positive individuals both in your life and both in your circumstance. Throughout history there was a tendency to be exploring very deeply disempowerment and helplessness and negativity along with positivity as well as a thread running in there. So if there was a greater tendency to attract perhaps what you would label individuals with slightly negative intentions because the mass approach was more of a negative approach and therefore those negative beings could be perceived clearly by the mass population. As you begin to transform and begin to express the positivity again not in denial of the negativity but in the acknowledgement of it you begin to attract positive and literally when you are an unconditionally loving being willing to acknowledge who you are willing to allow your expansion to include awareness of negativity but not experience of it because your actions are negative then negative beings literally cannot see you, cannot perceive you. So on a like are you so much that in your light not even a shadow would be cast. So due to the nature of the fact that mankind is transforming but it may not be evident upon your media and it will be you will notice that you will not see negative as much. You will not perceive it as much unless you are so focused, unless you are so in that sense sometimes as you say obsessed with the idea and again denying that such a thing exists is the same thing is stating that it does and you are afraid of it. Acknowledging that it exists but does not apply to you and moving with a positive vibration to attract the positive counterpoint would then perhaps you can say literally make it invisible to you so the nature has changed yes because your nature has changed. Does that answer the question? No, right to peace, so right. Anyone who has questions come up to their mic here. As Ilan is the only ET guest on the panel maybe he could answer this question. In general we seem to think of extra-tillistures as us and them but I am aware that there are many societies out there. Would you briefly maybe introduce three or four civilizations and kind of describe how they look or any differences? Very very briefly. Our particular society is what you would call the planet of Essoani. Our time stream differs from your own so it is not in synchronization with your own therefore it would be more difficult to perceive us unless that matching vibration is achieved. We do throw through technology though this can be done through consciousness as well. Our particular appearance is similar to your own though we are approximately five feet in height. Our skin is a bit more whitish gray a bit more clay like in that way. We have no hair except females who do have hair generally white. Our eyes are more upturned but in that sense still contain some what you call white though the pupil will occupy most of the eye so you may perceive that they are black. We are different from the beings that you sometimes see that we will also briefly discuss that are from the system called reticulum. We are perhaps you can say half way between both societies. What you call reticulum will be represented by beings that you sometimes refer to as gray beings with large black eyes, bug like beings in that sense that are involved in a phenomenon that we prefer to call temporary detainment you seem to insist on calling it abduction. The idea is that these beings are quite different from perhaps many of the other societies that we are discussing because they are as you can say a collective consciousness. They function much as bees in the hive and one of the things that they are exploring with your civilization is your emotionality for they have in a sense you may understand bread that out of their society and have had some negative repercussions in their reproductive idea from having done so. So therefore you are being a great service to these beings by allowing certain interactions. I say allowing these interactions though there are individuals who insist that it is happening to them I will guarantee you that from the perspective of higher self or over soul that is only agreement in these situations and individuals who deny the agreement feel that it is happening to them and are being victimized. Individuals who understand there must be an agreement begin to delve in what is the agreement perceive those temporary detainments as positive and generally do not go on talk shows about them for they are personal experiences to them and therefore you do not hear much about the individuals who have integrated this and made some sense of it. This will change for certain will step forward in order to assist others. Your understanding of what you call the 80 and would correspond to your brothers, sisters and cousins genetically and are much like you and would perhaps be imperceptible from you in a crowd. However, in many ways and it will depend upon which point in their history they are visiting you from because they do not visit you from simply one time frame in their history will seem to be fourth density beings this simply meaning still physical still having a body but not expressing the degree of limitation and separation that you do so seeming to have more shall I say say over their life and perhaps having more positive circumstances resulting from taking back their power. However, they are also in shall I say communication with you because you can now hear that message from them as well and likely again to be very brief and succinct to allow for other interaction what you call serious to us at this point in your history and again time gets very malleable because of the distances involved with lightly or loosely correspond to beings of light that have transformed largely into non physical beings from different points in their history you may perceive them as physical beings visiting you but contemporary to your own time frame there are literally beings of light swimming in a sea of light around a trinary system of stars your scientists now presuppose your serious system to be a binary system I will tell you it is a trinary system for now that will do. These two questions concern more of the 3D aspect I would like comments on the operation of the spaceport and the Nazca Highlands in Peru as to when it operated when it sees to operate the second question concerns the use of our Bible Bible's amounts on hornets which King Tut had as allegedly had as spiders and bombers. What's my line I guess the pails been stopped here? Okay. Next. Good question I guess we'll have to ask another panel another topic. Next question thank you. Well now I know what the answer could be but I'm going to speak anyway. It's my understanding that a group of people completed on Friday the 18th some work in the near Atlantis near Bimini I guess and what they did was heal an etheric tear in the earth's boundary and I wonder if anyone has any comment about that. Any comment or we said a bad president here. I'm not prepared to discuss individual historical line because to be everything is significant to the moment and the people who participated in the moment and then whatever you choose to interpret from that moment is your choice. We have a history 500 years based on the line and yet we've developed a culture on it. I'm talking about the so-called myth columnist discovering America. We have a history a two thousand year history based on an entity called Christ that there's really no historical evidence that this being lived and so it doesn't make any difference when you start focusing on a specific event in Bimini did they did they on the 18th rep you know heal whole in time. I'm sure they did if that was their intent then they did it and it's their personal experience and just like whatever you all did when you went inside the pyramid it was real and it's yours and that's the stand that I take on and everything I'll always go back to that rather than create these avenues that we all insist we have to agree on. It's all goes back to the moment individual experience and intention and you will find outside yourself those lines of history or those things that you can learn from and there's many ways of interpreting them as there are points of you and imaginations and I don't believe that any one event is created for that particular moment. I believe that the temples and all the things on the planet are here to be utilized over and over again in the same way that I often say to people that I work with someone will say to me I thought I got rid of this stuff I thought I processed this stuff through and now it's back again. It's time for another message. In the temple side and all the things that we're dealing with their messages is meaning as a symbol rather than something literal. So I would say if that's what you heard that's what they did. Do you get my point? You do. Okay. My particular perception again is that this is largely symbolic so the individuals involved the individuals that draw an awareness to the event will create an effect from it that is very real. Understand again that you only really ever exist as perhaps you will remember in the now moment. So when you speak about healing something from the so-called path you are creating the tear in the present and then doing the healing in the present. So it becomes somewhat arbitrary but again individuals who strongly understand that this is their reality. Yes. And even literally that for them not to be too nebulous. We are the keepers of the frequency and we would like to respond to your question from the following point of view. You are looking at the question of what you call on this planet the barque human controversy. And from our perspective it's the question of whether the tree falls in the forest if there is not someone there to perceive the tree falling. You know about the discussion on your planet? Yes you know about the discussion. And so from our perspective there are some very valuable lessons in your question and they come from the following perspective. You are now awakening your consciousness to the synchronicity principle and the synchronicity principle on your planet is the way out of the dilemma of being force fed with the idea that Christopher Columbus discovered America. The reason that everybody thinks this occurred is because so many people have heard this story and they believe it when in fact it is not true. And so first of all on your planet it is valuable for you to look at what actually happens such as a weaving of the etheric field in Vimini. And so it is that for you if you have some kind of energy connection with this event then this event is valuable to you and this event can be magnified and web woven onto your planet. And so the way in which you will learn how to weave a new web of positive energy, of hope, of love and not a web of lies and confusion and separation, the way for all of you in your individual personal lies, the way for you to access this knowledge is whenever you encounter the occurrence of a particular event. It is very important for you to search within your own experience in that time to examine your connection to it. And so we would like all of you to know that certain teachers have come to this conference with gifts of sacred pipes to the Egyptian people and they have been drawn to bring these gifts for the Egyptian people totally out of lack of awareness of any connection to what they were doing to anyone else. They were drawn to do this. And so it is as we share this space at this conference with these beings of very high order and these students of deep seeking. So it is also that the peace of course is being worked on right in this hotel. And so it is from these observances within your own personal reality that you will see the power in the events and then the potential power in the event such as peace in the Middle East becomes the reality on your planet. You mentioned about the peace of course that you place here. I have missed this to a couple of individuals but it may be good to point out just as a matter of fact that the first peace talks between Egypt and Israel took place in the Rubyite restaurant where you have breakfast every day. That is where the peace talks started years ago. So we are at a place of the transformation, the transformation of the Middle East into peace started where we are having breakfast right here. And of course the energy that has a tremendous impact on the planet as well. So I thought I would add that as an aside for our brother. I think next question or does anyone else come on here? Next question please. Good morning. My question possibly for two different invitations. I'd like to have some more information regarding the Iliaminados and how to recognize them in the society today. Thank you. Perhaps someone else on this one. The Illuminati. Yes. We are coming to the time where they will be moving into their integrity or they are going to disappear. And I'm sure that our friend Barbara Marciniac has some comments about this. They are going to disappear when you stop believing that they have any influence on you or your reality in any way whatsoever. You do grant them your power to have such influence. So they may be organized in that sense, though they may have an outstretched web. They have no power upon you to assert that they do or assign that something that you are experiencing in your life is not a result of your own power but a result of that situation. So as you begin to simply walk your talk and follow your own excitement and your own self, it literally has no effect upon you. Simply speaking, their control, if you will, is far less than even they revise. Yes, I do. Because I think the questions and the structure of everything, and I see some faces that are like, because we are giving a couple different points of view here. Number one, we can tell you a story and we can give you a whole line of history and describe the Illuminati and talk about other people and what they did at this time and that time. Or as Elon just said, how important is this? I mean, they exist. They've obviously created situations through which people can learn from by disempowering people, by becoming a reality for those who need to learn about disempowerment. But over the years, I remember when I was growing up, we used to have air raids. I don't know if you all had air raids and you had to dive into the desk. When I was a little kid, I would think when's the bomb going to drop? And then I grew up and I stopped watching television in the 20s and it went about 20 years ago, in the 70s. And I would hear all these things that were supposed to happen, but they never happened in that world. They never happened in my world. And I began to realize that these things do exist, but they don't affect me unless I really need the message from them. And of course, I participate in a society of which I'm a collective and so if this Illuminati wants to crash the society and they're doing a pretty good job of it now, but I see they're doing us a favor. I think as a mass, we have given our power away and when we do, we need to become aware of the so-called tyrannical forces that we create ourselves when we choose not to be responsible, to create the ever-expanding moment which you choose how you will fill it up. So you can either focus on two different things here and it's great that the discussion is going this way and that's my comment. Now to take this one step further, when you view such an idea of any disempowering structure or a shall I say structure that intends to be disempowering, you have two choices. Number one, why me? Or number two, how is even this of service to me? And in allowing a structure intending to be disempowering to not have any power over you and using that as a reflection to see that you no longer wish to give away your power, you can turn this around quite opposite and even say that structure has been of service to you, to allow you to see that you no longer wish to give your power away in this way and you can actually express appreciation for their willingness to play as you say that end of that game. So it all depends. Why me? You experience this empowerment from the structure and can say well it's their fault. How is this of service to me? You say thank you to them. Game symbol, different approach. Yeah, go. I can don't not really understand that, because having this right-hand or to stop a big our two-year system i want to you we are extra- Informant Guiduos you are extra excels Hughes It is simply a point of view. Now we embrace other societies again as complete equal. So extra essthesonians are simply other beings, again friends, neighbors, cousins, and so forth. To you, extra-terrestrials many times will represent higher consciousness in some way meaning better, rather than simply equal and different. So the connotation may be different, but one of the things I am here to share is that it need not be. We will view you as an equal no matter how you view us, but once you view us as an equal as well, you will have the advantage of the equality of the relationship. We are not truly teachers and you are learners. It would be an accurate completely to say that we do not learn from. Equality. Extra simply means more, not foreign. It need not mean foreign. We need not be so alien to you, but we will represent also symbolically your willingness to begin to explore portions of your own consciousness that appear to forebend alien. But now that you are embracing him, you simply have extra to choose from. So it is all your point of view. We can give you information from the perspective of our vehicle who exists simultaneously on Elseon as well as on Earth. And what she experiences is that when she is on Elseon, working in the libraries, there is a special temple for the planet Earth. And the planet Earth is located in the center of a temple which has many around columns around it. And the beings on Elseon do meditations and sound chanting with this temple in order to vibrate consciousness with the planet Earth. And from our vehicle's perspective, she enjoys going to Elseon because Elseon gives her another perspective. She moves into another center. You see you as you sit here, you are centers of consciousness and then your awareness radiates out from where you are located out as far as it can go. And so you enjoy coming to Egypt on this trip, right? So can't you imagine that it would be fun to travel to another planet or another star? Can you imagine this is fun? And what it does, our vehicle also is a astrologer. It spends quite a bit of time traveling to the other planets in order to understand their consciousness so that she can understand how their consciousness affects the humans on this planet whom she is doing readings for. And so she is to understand mercury. She goes to mercury and she spends time there. And so you see, this is what this really is for you is this is an extension of your creativity. And our vehicle's first perception of this type of traveling was that it was fun. And after it was fun for a long time, then she started to use it as a form of expanded creativity. So yes, I agree completely with your perspective. And I would say that the meaning of this period of time until 2012, 2013 AD, would be that those of you who remain in body on this planet will also have the ability to be aware of your consciousness in other locations. And this is really what the transition is all about. Very exciting, by the way. And individuals will explore in this way already do. What I wish to draw a distinction of is individuals who do so for other reasons. You chose to be here, make as you say no bones about it. And therefore, living this reality and in the curiosity of this reality expanding to include other realities is one thing. Wishing to visit another planet to, as you say, I will take liberality with your language, get the heck out of here is quite enough. It is a denial of the decision that you have made to be here. So I simply say, be mindful when you desire something as to whether it is curiosity, whether it is the joy of discovery as with this individual, or whether it is a form of escape. You need not in that way perceive your planet as a jail or a sentence or a test. You can, obviously, if you do, you get that effect. But it is an equal and valid reality unto itself with unique characteristics that you would not want to miss. And perhaps you will sometimes reincarnate until you actually dive in to discovering many of these ideas that are only available upon this planet. This planet is a joyous place, as well as the other realities that you create to exist upon it. And what you call heaven is not somewhere to get to. It is something to express wherever you are. Where you are has the ability to take on the quality of what you call heaven. So therefore, heaven on earth has you experiencing in your life in such a way that when it's time to go, or shall I say you choose to go, you are full as though you have eaten a large meal. Not that you have gotten out of here. Hi, I'm Barbara Ann. The thought or the concept that I'm even connected to an et is very new to me. In fact, it's about a day old. Happy birthday. So if I ask a question that I've already heard the answer, please excuse that. Probably you need to hear the answer many times. I would just say that if you had a chance to interact with the vehicle yet, have you or not? I have no idea. The vehicle is Barbara Ann Clow. You have not. Well, you must make sure that you do, because you will find that she is very human. And she will stand in front of you and say, I'm a pliadian. And so it's a matter of getting used to it. And it certainly is a strange phenomenon. Certainly is strange to observe the channels in particular. However, as we go through the shift, the way that you will become used to these ideas is first, by seeing these ideas manifest in beings that you can understand. And then you will begin when you are ready, if you ever are ready, you will begin to feel new energies and new awarenesses in yourself that will fascinate you. And one of the earliest and easiest ways to tell that this special kind of energy is coming into you is when you become filled with fascination. I had a question after that introduction. My question has to do with energy vortexes. It happens that by coincidence or not coincidence, I am here this weekend I am in Sedona next weekend. And I'm wondering from the extraterrestrial point of view, what is the importance of these vortexes? What do they contribute to me and everyone else? Do not wish to dominate the conversation. Does anyone else wish to answer? OK, something. Briefly, there's certain places on the Earth where energy is marked. Plating in Sub-autons said that the sacred sites are really places that have acupuncture needles in them. Our four fathers and four mothers, obviously had extraterrestrial, off-planetary influence and could read the energies and mark the places where energies are. They're called vortex, portals, plating in scotum, bucket sometimes. And people go there. And I believe that often the event, the place itself has an agenda. And then you have your own agenda. And what you do there, of course, is a combination of those two things. And you can, maybe these places happen all over the planet. Part of my work has been to most recently, instead of going and seeking these sites that have been marked everywhere, is to begin to build them ourselves. And last summer, I worked with about 130, 40 people in Raleigh, North Carolina. And we began to build our own serpent mount so that we now have our own vortex and our own sacred site. And we can step into it rather than having to travel all over the world. And I think that this is what we all need to do as people, rather than adoring what's been, let's empower ourselves and create and honor the Earth, rate where we are, and think of our bodies as sacred sites, and build a temple of sacred site, honor the Earth in your property. And there's places where the energy's definitely enhanced. You can feel it. You'll be drawn to it. You feel good. But also, you can take a place that's very depleted and offer it as a woman, offer your blood. And as a person, offer your love, start speaking to the Earth and to create places of sacredness. And this is what Egypt and all these places around the planet offer me, my own inspiration to create for myself and my moment where I live, something special. If I may add to the question, because I know there's still more answers coming to it. But if I understand your question correctly, and can perhaps enhance it, basically that the power places of power vortex is our place of higher vibratory rate. And thereby speed our own personal evolution, because when you go there and lift your vibratory rate, if you're in a place for that to happen, and evolution, personal evolution, you can be seen as an increase in our vibratory rate to loosely quoted old Tibetan saying, one hour in a power place of power vortex is worth 1,000 hours of meditation. That would be the reason. So if that asks the question so that we could get the extraterrestrial aspect on that from the two who are now channeling. All right, may I? You have in your body what you call chakras. This idea are centers of energy. Ultimately, in your pristine infinite state, you are one sphere of energy. I use the word sphere arbitrarily. It is not accurate, but we'll do as an analogy. To experience becoming physical or finite, there is a degree of removal from the one source that you are. And one of the ways that this expresses energetically in what you call body is in what you call chakras. As, by the way, you become less physical. You find you have less and less of them till you are back to the one. This is also true for what you call your planet, which is a sentient being, not simply a hunk of rock spinning in space coincidentally. It too has particular areas of coagulation, if you will, of energy, much of this initially has to do with what you call the fluid dynamics of the spin of your planet and certain characteristics, magnetically speaking, of the interaction of the poles with the spin. However, as this other individual has fascinatingly illustrated, as the planet, as the mass consciousness also begins to integrate, begins to collect itself back together, you will begin to see the emergence of more of these seeming spots actually, therefore sometimes created by certain individuals with intention. Till finally, the planet itself will represent one, perhaps you can say, complete crown chakra itself, containing all the other ideas, or chakras. So the idea of intentionally creating an idea whereby there is the focus of intention to create less gaps between these spaces, to fill in the gaps, so to speak, will allow for what you call a homogenization of the field of your planet. And this is very exciting. It occurs once again individually, but also occurs flonaterily. From our perspective, you have asked an extremely interesting question, and the answers are fascinating to us. We see this as a visual, and we see your planet, and we see the center of your planet. And as we see the vortexes, as you call them, these are places on the surface of the planet, which have a direct line of energy down into the center of your planet. Do you understand? And so it is that what Barbara Marcia has said is very fascinating to us, because we have been noticing these experiences with these vortexes and sacred sites. And all of it is wonderful and beautiful and very important. But there was something missing. And Barbara Marcia has alluded to this. We would look at it from the following point of view. According to the Canadian system, the first chakra of your body is the center of the earth. And you have five chakras in your body, being the root chakra, solar plexus, heart chakra, throat chakra, and third eye. And then the crown chakra functions as a connecting point to the galactic center. So as we see you, we see a connection point in the galactic center, five chakras in the body, and one chakra in the center of the earth. And so it is when your energy fields are correctly organized. As you walk on the surface of your planet, you have consciousness of the power of the earth chakra going through your body, through your five chakras, and to the galactic center. You understand? And so from our point of view, these vortexes and sacred sites were created at a point in time when the beings on your planet who live on the surface started experiencing a closing down of the earth chakra, a loss of connection with the earth chakra. And so these places have been created for you as keys to open the earth chakra for you. So as you go there, you begin to discover energy going through your body because the other six chakras cannot get enough energy going through your body to the galactic center unless you have the earth chakra open. You understand? And so from the point of view of Barbara Marciniak, who is a very evolved being in her physical body in this lifetime as well as the work that she does, she has activated the earth chakra sufficiently in her system at this time so that she now has the ability to feel the center of the earth on any place on the surface of your planet. And so it is as we see a visual, we see the center of your earth as some of you know from the teaching of our vehicle as the garden of Eden. Garden of Eden. And as it is on your planet, when you are balanced with the stars, the garden of Eden exists on the surface of your planet. And so it will be the groups of people such as Barbara Marciniak and her group will begin opening the sacred sites all over the surface of the planet so that finally the energy is all integrated. As it was, the vortexes and portals were created in a sense as safety zones. And you notice that many sacred cultures such as the Tibetan culture, the vortexes are guarded by beings of superior consciousness, monks, priests, creases, et cetera, who guard the way the energy is worked with when you go there. You have noticed this. And so it is that now you go to these sacred sites where there are in many cases the guardians are not there and therefore something wonderful is happening on your planet now where you are all learning to be guardians by going there and working with the energy correctly at that sacred site. I have a question which I think. My question was about certain. I have an interest in cultural events and cultural history. And I feel curious about what happened at a particular time on this planet. And I would like to know if you could inform me about it. It seems to me that there was a point before the war in Germany where there was intense negative energy that we are still filling the effects up in our culture, particularly in art and music and the nuclear power on this planet. And I haven't been able to figure out why unless it was just thought forms. Sometimes I think it was extraterrestrial and origin. So I would like to know if you could film it and hit me at all. Thank you. It is not my particular perspective that it is extraterrestrial. In origin, it is quite terrestrial in origin. And the idea is, again, that there need not be any effects from any other period other than what you recreate in the now moment and your relationship to it. So individuals recreate it in the now moment using some particular event, using some particular criteria as an excuse. But it is truly a recreation, a new creation, a perpetuation of creation, and nothing that has any inherent momentum. As we have said before, momentum is an illusion. Because you can change in any given now moment, that is, shall I say, opposite of the definition of momentum. Momentum would presuppose that you could not change for there is always a movement beyond the moment. But because you can in any moment simply turn, simply change your perspective, simply express something else completely, immediately. That presupposes that momentum then would stop, and momentum does not stop. So momentum is an illusion that you create. Now I understand that it feels quite real when you create it. And I'm not in any way denying that. But what I am saying is that you have a choice of where you focus. If you focus upon negativity and then bring in a path as a reason for recreating that negativity in the present, it will seem as though it has happened to you from then. If you simply decide this is no longer who I choose to be, not taking responsibility for the other individuals who still create it, you will no longer begin to attract them. And so therefore will not so much seem to think that it is still perpetuating. And shall I say permeating your present reality. And then you will begin to see these individuals ironically seeming to change as well. For only when you change yourself will other seem to change. So look at where you match that vibration. More than using that vibration as an excuse to be pulled toward it. You recreate it. You always create in each moment completely. You assign meaning as to where you feel creations that you create are coming from. But ultimately you have the option to take it back to being still yourself. So what you are saying is applying to the individuals who buy into it and who perpetuate it in their reality. But others will not be aware of it at all, meaning you have a choice. From our point of view the answer to your question is astrology. And the best thing you can say about astrology is it tells you when it's over. And we feel the pain in your throat chakra. And we feel the need in your consciousness to have a mental concept which helps you deal with this issue for you. And so it is that mental concepts are useful in time. And so we would say to you that the planet Pluto was cited from the perspective of Earth in 1930. And as a result of the sighting of Pluto, your planet has agreed to in a sense volcanoized itself. It has agreed to take all of the energies in its system, which involve anger, which involve power over, which involve abuse of others, all energies on your planet, which evolve actions toward others, which do not come from respect of the other. Ask toward others which are not in personal integrity of the individual taking on these actions. You understand? And so it is that where astrology offers you assistance is first of all, as soon as the planet was cited, you have the splitching of the atom, which is going to eventually result in a healing of yourselves. Because now that you see the results of splitching, you finally will begin to integrate. And so it is also that you have had an outbreak of war and abuse and violence on your planet, not only in these wars, but also in your actual streets, in your actual communities. So from our perspective, from the point of view of astrology, you will not be completed with this process of dealing with these intense difficult emotions until Pluto has gone through one full cycle from its sighting, which is 240 years after 1930. However, before all of you in the room freak out, the galactic sensor has set this situation up in this particular time on your planet that the maximum intensity of this energy is from 1984 to 1999. And this involves issues of the planet Pluto being very close to the surface of your Earth, as well as in a speeding up portion of its orbit. And so you are in the middle of the most intense part of this experience as a matter of fact, regarding your question, very, very intense experiences with this particular issue this year. And so in actuality, astrology offers you some understanding of this process because Pluto represents purification. And purification of energy cannot occur until all of the experiences that need to be completed are completed. And so it is that you are in the middle of this process, but you are coming closer and closer to the end. And as you approach 1999, the energies will begin to turn into a much more pure form of clearance that will move above the emotional body. I just want to add one thing that we've probably done something in the Pleiadians channel, and I think I'm recalling it correctly, is the idea that events are like magnets, and they seek those who wish to participate in them. And the bottom line is that we have this whole system here based on separation, and of course, separation makes judgment. And of course, if we were not separated and we were all united, then there would be known in discoveries. So we go around and around with these same ideas. And at that particular period of time and today, we embrace and we encourage as a society, victimhood. We allow our newspapers. We allow the media. We allow the concept of victimhood, and we support it. And so this in itself creates the manipulations that happen as you refer to music, to art, literature, that the codes are hidden. You cannot access the codes of ecstasy and the codes that are going to connect you to everything if you believe you are a victim. Because when you believe you are a victim, then you have no power. Your power ends where your fear begins. And so as a collective astrologically, and the keepers' father were beginning to say this, that is the answer. Planets and stars create lines of time, and they create slices of opportunity that are defined in certain ways. And you can come within, be born within those slices, platonic period, these neighborhood period. You have complete free will to make your choice in the moment as to perpetrating the victimhood, arising above it and understanding it. And so I feel that at this period of time, there's enough people on the planet who are choosing to release this idea that we're powerless, that we're victims, and that someone does something to us. And I'm talking about babies. I'm talking about Somalia. I'm talking about all over the world. No matter what this situation is, people agree to it. They're available for it, and they choose it. And when we continue to support people and victims, then we continue to create this over and over and over again. And all you can have is compassion and honor for people's choices as to how they are. And I feel that the best way you can influence anyone is to get clearly in yourself. Like what your own world is, and allow people to be in theirs, and reflect the possibility of what they can't have by supporting them. So that's why it happens in our tables, basically, from what I'm going to do. Well, first. I mean, I'm companion. The reality that I want to do is different. And which reality? No, I'm not. Everything is to me, everything is to me, to how it feels. And so how do you determine what's in real meaning, and this is the dream, or the reality, what different the reality is, the claim that you realize. And we're in this one caution from the reality of the claim. How do you feel the video now, and you'll be doing the same, so how you know which video you should be doing. Why do you wish to make the distinction? Is this distracting to you? Or can you simply drink from whichever so-called video you are watching? It gives great use, right? And everybody else is doing the same too. And truth on your mind starts you trying when you're playing. Oh. And then the reason for things to emerge on there. Well, it is not simply intrusion, simply other choices. And though it may not be the mass agreed upon, as you say, video, it is still up to you to not judge yourself for playing the videos that you enjoy. My suggestion, get some popcorn. Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Thank you. Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! And the all idea of channel surfing, okay? I mean, I stopped watching television 20 years ago, but I hear now that you can like sit with a little box and pick from 150 stations. I mean, who wants to? I mean, it's just such a big deal to make a decision of where to go. And to me, technology simply reflects back to us what we're capable of doing ourselves. So that means that as you have the opportunity to channel surf and watch this video and be in this station, in this station, it means that you have that much choice in your own life. And I say go for the easiest, get clear about what you want, go for it. Define the parameters of your experience and choose. And don't listen to anyone else, especially if they tell you it's impossible. Decide what feels best to you and then be there. May we ask information of you? So that we understand what you're talking about? Are you there? Are you talking about you're running along in your video and then you run into somebody else's video and you get confused about where you are? This is something you experience. This is very interesting. We would advise you to do the following thing. Whenever you are in your reality and you perceive another reality and it feels to you like as you perceive it, you are like getting lost in it or involved in it and then the information that you gather in the other reality then confuses your own reality. Is this correct? All right. What we would advise you to do and you must, if you ask a question, you must take the answer seriously. Popcorn is a good idea. We also would suggest that whenever you have this experience that you take time during that day before the sun sets down, to sit down for a moment and tune into your own video and visualize your video. For instance, visualize like you might visualize your own house or apartment, your own city, kind of visualize the reality that you travel in. And then once you have a strong visual image of your reality, you then need to drink a glass of milk. And if you will do this for seven times in a row, this difficulty will disappear. Ah, popcorn and milk. All right. Interesting combination. Hi. My name is Stan and last fall I was directed to what is called the Gimme Pyramid in Australia. And you talked about a lot of power places and it's not very well known and a friend of mine just told me about it and they went over to investigate it to see what I thought of it. And I just wonder if any of you could enlighten me as to the beginnings of if we're iterated and exactly what sort of thing it is. It's in Queensland about two or three hours northwest of Brisbane. Perhaps you will understand that in using what you call major board disease or power places if you will as analogy to the chakras that that would be an active puncture point. It is perhaps you can understand a minor point in that sense, not lesser, simply of lesser intensity in that way. I've been to Australia a few times and I'm not familiar with this particular site though all over Australia from my experience the aboriginals have a deep long history of their own multi-dimensional identity and their stellar connections. And they walk about the lay lines and they keep these sites and I've never encountered it. I'm sure it's another acupuncture point marking a place of some significance and what it does I really don't know. What did you experience there? How did you feel? That's where you can really get the answer. At the tune in when you go to these places and go well what is this doing to me? And especially after you leave a site notice the days afterwards how the sites affected you and then you can start tuning in to you know why it was built and what was there. But it's the best I can give you right now. Okay, do any of the three of you have a final comment to make? You don't have to but if you do we can we have a couple minutes left to take it. If you don't we'll be finished. Anyone else first? Go ahead. All right. I wish to thank you all for being bold for following your excitement for in that sense acting with integrity. I wish to thank you for acting literally as ambassadors from your civilization. I also wish to thank the other members of what you call the panel for acting as ambassadors of other civilizations as well. These types of interactions regardless of how you will choose to interpret them have great value and allow you to all explore what you each individually need to explore. You attract what it is that will be most conducive to allow you to do what it is that you wish and desire if you will look at it that way. And therefore this will be a direct reflection of this decision of this choice. You are very willing when you see someone else doing something that you find exciting, satisfying to them to pat them on the back. Well raise your own hand and occasionally pat yourself on the back as well. In fact give yourselves a hand right now if you will. The interaction that we create with you is ongoing because we in particular are telepathic beings you can connect with us. There is no quite theory. Simply in whatever state you create as meditation it need not be sitting still it can be in the movement of your life. Tune into how you feel when you interact with me. For that matter when you interact with any other entity or individual how you feel about it. Keys you into the vibration of that particular source. So begin to utilize your own transceiver as well. It is fun I understand to create a particular format whereby you can remove this from yourself and interact with it seemingly separately. But you do not need to do so. The joy of doing so is one thing. But doing so from a need sells yourself short. You contain it all. You contain it all. You express yourself as existing within a body your body is actually within your consciousness. So is your planet. So is your pyramid. So is your solar system and on and on and on. You contain it all and you are expanding exponentially. All right. Pyramidically. So therefore enjoy your expansion if you will and love yourself with no conditions. Then you will be loving yourself as all that is or God loves you. For judgment is human made. Judgment is the imposition of conditions. Unconditional means the love is not a love you can lose. It is automatic no matter what. So the judgment that you feel comes from yourself. Oh someone else is judging me you may say only if you match it to you feeling. If someone says you are read you look at them like well I don't feel read and there's no charge. If someone judges you and you are not judging yourself you say oh well they must be judging themselves on some level to be affording such judgment to someone else. That is invalidation. Validation is self love. Following your excitement with integrity is the validation of who you are. Is expressing that you have chosen to be here and that you are willing to accept the symbol the vibration of that excitement as the indication from your higher self that in any given situation this is most me it must be I'm excited about it and that vibrancy that energy of excitement itself will always tell you this is most me in any given situation. So you have all the tools you need. This does not mean you cannot share and once again experience these types of interactions but you have all the tools you need. We thank you for your willingness to share the gift that you are with us and make no less about it than that. But we do not come to offer you anything that you do not have. We come to share with you what you already have and perhaps also and again this is very significant. Get as much from you and the things that you experience that are unique to your society as you do from us. It is reciprocal. Therefore I thank you for the gift that you have given us and I thank you for being willing to give yourself gifts as well. I bid you a most fond and loving pleasant dreams and good day. The only thing I have to add and not too much aware of what went on for a while but I saw a lot of visual images and gained more understanding about sacred sites today. And more understanding about why it is valuable to experience a sacred site with an indigenous kefir and once you have experienced it with an indigenous kefir to go ahead and take your power and work with the sacred site with those keys. And so in this lifetime I was trained by my grandfather to understand sacred sites all around the planet. However, because the Cherokee culture has been so fragmented during my time I did not receive like direct teachings like at Cherokee sites. The information on the Cherokee information is actually so old that it is going to be a while before it even comes in. And so I trained with other indigenous kefirs who were trained from birth about the way to work with sacred sites. And so when I work with a particular sacred site for instance in Egypt working with Hakim he is teaching me the keys about how to open that site because he is a keeper here and he understands. And there is no question that the sacred sites first of all if you go there just by yourself you can get a lot of energy and you can tune in in a very very deep way. But there is something special that happens when the keeper is able to open the sacred site and there is no question that they can open the portal into the earth and then into the stars in a very special way because they understand the keys of a particular site. So I would just encourage you that this is a very valuable experience. And then what is wonderful from my perspective is once you learn how to do this then you can do it yourself and you can do it with other people yourself. And so that is what I have to say. The to close with this whole idea of extraterrestrial influence on the planet we are going to create whatever we as a mass and as individuals need to catapult us probably with a little bit of a shock into a new belief system. And how you are going to interpret our interactions with stellar consciousness is based on what you need to learn. In the same way that you interact with races and different cultures what is your intention what do you want. So you can learn a lot from other people by watching how they are going to react. And remember that part of what we are challenged to do today is to be individuals rather than to be part of this herd of consciousness where we are given these ideas and everyone is encouraged to think the same way. And this of course comes from the media. So your challenge and my challenge and our whole challenge is that as we begin to recognize extraterrestrial influence we of course acknowledge it but it is coming all over the planet. And how is it going to be interpreted based on what you need to know and that is what your experience is going to be. So think very and feel very selectively about what you would like to experience in your future. Have fun. Thank you all. Through you and each of you individually as well. And all those going to secur are within 15 minutes on the steps.
