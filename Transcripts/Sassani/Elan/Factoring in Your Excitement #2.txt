 All right, I'll say before we continue, allow me to say the following. Often in a given moment, the unique choices that are available may seem, perhaps if you are comparing it to some overall picture, as insignificant choices that could not possibly in that sense, as you say, lead to anything fruitful. The idea is that no matter what those choices are in each and every moment, one or more will stand out, will draw your attention, and though they may seem trivial, or they may seem as though the only thing that I have a choice to do right now could not possibly yield anything. So, using your excitement to choose from what is available, no matter what it is, allows you to remain in action in alignment with who it is you say you desire to be. And so, therefore, the choices can present themselves as things that you may generally refer to, or societally refer to as mundane. You can take a walk. You can, as you say, read a book, take a ride, take a drive, feed the birds, whatever. Understanding that if taking that walk is the most exciting thing that you can imagine from those options, and that you are able to take that walk with integrity, that that walk is, no matter what it appears on the surface, as essential towards your reason for expressing yourself as a physical being, as anything else you will ever do, because it's all one thing. One overall purpose with many different, excited expressions and components. And so, therefore, you need not in that sense say, well, these choices are all trivial, and therefore, it really does not matter which one I choose, you will make a choice, you will act upon that choice. And perhaps the distinction here is whether you are going to allow that choice to be random with then a random result or purposeful, reasonful, where then you can only get some type of purposeful result. And you will notice, using the example of taking the walk, that if that is the most exciting thing to do, it would behoove you to keep your eyes open on that walk, to be willing to be receptive for whatever results from making a decision, trusting that decision, and taking that action. Again, particularly if the foundation for that decision is the discernment of your excitement. Taking that walk will inevitably yield something you did not expect, and will inevitably lead to some other new option into the pile of options that was not there before. And this idea, getting results that provide new choices and new options is why you find that when you are willing to honor who you are and express yourself as that being fully, that the rate at which your life transformed is what you call exponential. Where you continue to create results based on actions that are a complete reflection of who you know yourself to be. And so therefore those results are also reflections of who you know yourself to be, and again get added into the stew of choices in the new moment. Simply, in that sense, wish to make that degree of distinction because that is the degree to which you can apply you, which is what your excitement is. It is you allowing yourself to be most fully cognizant of who you are in that moment with what's available. As you say, enough said about that. Shitting. All right. Male. I have heard you say that you come from the civilization on a planet, and I wonder how do you have an atmosphere which you breathe? Hey. Do you have quite similar to your own, though perhaps were you to make the observation, it would appear more oxygen-rich slightly. Would you have a garden that you would grow things that you mean? What do you mean? Our diet is quite as you say, vestigial at this point. We actually, in that sense, absorb energy directly from what you would call our atmosphere, directly from what you would call our central star, directly from what we would call the life force itself. Though, we do still have what you call vestigial mouths, perhaps some virgin, that you would call vestigial teeth, and therefore can for a spontaneous given reason still eat, in terms of what you call gardens. There is not so much the rigidized expression that you would call a garden where individuals would have them behind their houses, so to speak, since we do not all have houses anyway. But the idea is there may be certain individuals who would, in that sense, perhaps loosely you could say interest themselves in applying their artistry toward what you call the landscape. So from our perspective, it would not be so much a gardener as one that is expressing their creativity through nature. And finally, how do you reproduce? Similar to the way that you do accept, though there can, again, vestigial, be a bodily exchange, which is now only symbolic. Generally speaking, it is an energetic exchange at this point in our expression. Actually, it is not. The direct energy exchange still has some of the characteristics, the ecstatic characteristics of which you are familiar. Oh, thank you. And another one. Oh, it's female. I have a question. Oh, over here first. Oh, good. I have questions, though. I'm a teacher and I teach special ed children. Oh, special ed. I love that term. But these kids are kids that we, if they're nonverbal or, you know, if they can't walk or they have various different... In a sense, by the way, special ed is quite apropos for that type of consciousness, and although it varies in its expression, represents the ultimate physical specialist. And why I mention this is, in general, now again, there are many different expressions of this. We are perhaps speaking of what you might refer to as the more extreme. These individuals seem oblivious in many ways because they are so finely focused, generally on one or several particular things, and it is at the cost of everything else. So you will find in individuals such as that, if you are willing and able to establish what that focus is, or in other words, according to what I am saying, what their specialty is, then you can then find that they can oftentimes produce things that can also interact with you in your own reality. Do proceed. Simply as I know. My question was, I mean, I've done hands on healing, training, and all sorts of spiritual type learning practices and such. And I mean, I'm on the floor and you're playing with them, you're trying to get them to interact. And sometimes it feels like we're never going to get through. You can't get eye contact, they won't talk to you from bite kits, they don't even want us to go into their space. And our legally blind, I mean, we're working with so many different variables. I want to see if you could give me a perspective as a special education teacher of any way to get through to them, or do we just accept that that way? Absolutely. And the idea is that you can apply your own creativity to determine how you go about this. But again, it is very on topic for this evening, which is the thing that they are expressing as their specialty is generally something which very obviously excites them. Now if they can see, you can simply show them different things and you will notice that most things elicit no response, certain things elicit a definite excited response. If it is what you call individuals who are physically blind, you can simply hand them things or test out different types of what you refer to as tonal vibration, music and so forth. But you will find that once you discover their specialty, this is where what you generally refer to as miracles, we refer to it as the rule, not the exception, these individuals can then apply their specialty, which they often, if not all times, would appear to be genius in. That is the nature. They are so specialized. Experts in but usually one or simply several things and at the cost of everything else. If you focus on the obliviousness, you are often doing so at the cost of the specialty. So be willing to assume they are experts, be willing to assume they contain the ability to express genius and begin to reality test what they obviously respond to and that will lead you in a certain direction. Okay, we have a woman we get a child, like an autistic child who will love to separate out of spinning things. We take those things away from them because we don't want them for separating that certain thing. But you know what I'm saying? They might like spinning. So if we gave them a top, all they would do for the six hours of their in school is just spin that top and they don't want to do any of the academic work or anything else that we want them to experience. But perhaps they are the ultimate top spinning specialist. Would you want to deprive them of that? But the idea is also once you find something that does excite them, you can continue to test for other things that do. For as I have said, often it is several things and at least you will know, as you say when push comes to shove, at least there is the top. Also, understand, often times it will be obvious if they are expert and genius top spinners. And if they are not simply turning the top in some way which is not unique, which is not in that sense different. Again, you may continue to test and see and present and watch the response. They are, by the way, very willing to express outwardly the indication that something is exciting to them. In our system, everybody wants the kids to be quote, you know, normal and they're just not normal if you compare them to all the other average children. My question was like, Ava, like, ability to move around energy or do anything. Do I have any advantage to help them? Can you give me? If you go in with the assumption that there is nothing wrong with them and simply find what it is they are here to do, that is completely shifting the typical perspective. And in fact, what you are doing, perhaps one way to put it, is you are functioning in allowing them in discovering what is natural for them as opposed to what you call normal, which is quite arbitrary. I'll try this while I'm teaching from my school. Oh, why? Perhaps you will do it rather than try this, which is one step removed from doing. All right? All right. All right. Thank you. Is there something else? From me at this moment. Oh, why? Female. I'd like to clarify some things so that I will have a question. I'd like to clarify some things so that I will have more of that energy from my excitement. Oh, why? And I do understand the difference between knowingness and a belief. Now, I have a belief at this time that in order for me to stay physically healthy, I need to eat certain foods of a certain quality and to take better and supplement. Oh, that is a belief, by the way, that you not so much have, but from the infinite well of belief that you contain, that is the one that you are expressing. Yeah. I think that distinction do proceed. Very well, I, to get rid of that belief, however, that doesn't really serve me if I, and I remember very clearly when you said to Cecil, uh, Donnie Brock. And by that answer, I talked that you really weren't telling us that perhaps we didn't need to, uh, take vitamins, supplements, or eat certain healthy foods. Actually, it was upon but do you process it? Well, if I thought that I could just go to the supermarket that is available to me and buy whatever appeal to me and eat without a lot of fuss and time and not buy the vitamins and supplements. Would you then be mindful in that sense as to when your body was telling you, I am full and then stop. In other words, what I am suggesting is that the idea again of being willing to be natural as opposed to needing to be normal and rising to some standard that may not apply to you would take the form of trusting what you crave, allowing yourself to partake of what you crave, understanding when you are physically satisfied and stopping, which is very easy to do if you are attuned to it. And by removing the system of denying yourself things, you fall into a natural flow where your body tells you what you need rather than you dictating to it with the buckshot at the side of a barn approach. But at first when individuals are willing to dive into this, it may seem as though they overindulgent things, but when they continue to allow themselves to be in a natural relationship with their body intelligence, this quickly changes and you find you crave, as you say, only certain things, many of which will still be the helpful in the normal sense things that you discuss to begin with, others which may allow you a little bit more variety. If you can mind that our inner super market is standard in basically to make the food last a long time, the quality of our food is not helpful probably. By the way, this is all arbitrage. And again, depending on the belief that you express for your physical body, the very statement of life on your planet is an expression of the ultimate ability to adapt. And so therefore, you are far more able to adapt, you are far more able to transform your physical expression to be able to process things than you imagined. And the idea that there are negative components that you then take on is truly a decision. When you get into natural step with who you are, and initially it may seem what you crave, you will find you will not so much crave as simply be mildly excited about something. And in that sense, the idea of craving takes on a different meaning. For the idea of being excited about something and denying it creates a longing. The idea about being excited about something and allowing yourself it and being mindful of the body intelligence creates a natural flow, which does not result in what you call a longing, does not result in what you call craving, and results on a baseline excitement that allows you to see this is what I wish to eat, period. I don't have craving, it's not really that. I think my belief system is being constantly altered by the information fed to me. As it will be, particularly in light of nutrition, which could be perhaps one of the more confusing ideas upon your planet in that there are so many presentations of options, many of which are completely diametrically opposed, so that you cannot really get grounded in any one philosophy with weight whereby it cannot be disproven by something else that it simply puts you into the space, if you will, to allow yourself to be natural with yourself. You don't have natural food anymore. Natural simply meaning, understanding this is what I wish to eat, eating it, I'm full onto the next thing. What are my new choices? This, this and that. That excites me onto that. What about the supplements? It becomes part of that flow. It kind of made it sound like you don't really need to have those supplements and yet I've been told that I need to have calcium and they have a lot of new ones coming out all the time, they're supposed to make us more. Understood but do understand when you honor the natural tendency, you will find that you will attract and the very things that you in a sense are attracted to will simply have those things within them automatically in the proper dosages. Just go for markets, healthy food is going to have all the vitamins we need. If you, if you, not so much if you believe it, if you trust yourself and begin to get into sync with your own system of personal feedback rather than negated, which then creates the dynamic opposition which results in what you call craving and longing. By the way, I said that to apply to others, not yourself. What I'm getting at is if I believe that I will be healthy without all of this other stuff, then I will be. If you trust your body's intelligence and honor yourself, yes, you will attract whatever you need to allow you to provide sustenance in the proper amounts. You're not saying I could go home and throw all the supplements out. I will never say anything of that nature, I am simply saying one other option is to get into natural flow. You would be part of my belief system, in other words, I read that I need all this stuff. If I choose not to believe that and you said we didn't really need them, that would assist my belief in that way. The system of the buckshot at the side of the barn approach is not necessarily a natural approach. It is coming from the assumption that you are lacking, it is coming from the assumption that you are already not hold, and therefore you will attract evidence that will support that idea to begin with. If you can simply understand yourself as a whole being and trust what it is that you attract, you will not need to throw out anything. It will simply be a storage closet that you may or may not use from time to time when it occurs to you. They are tools, but generally speaking, in the way that they are intended would fall under the category of overkill. Yet in some cases, older women are supposed to have calcium now. I could say, well, I won't need it, but then... The idea is if you need calcium, you will simply attract the foods rich in that. Not even needing to be aware of it, but if you wish to be aware of it to marvel at your slender, you can begin to see I am attracting this, this, and this. Interesting, when I look that up in the book, it has a lot of calcium. What a coincidence. That is natural flow. That is trusting and acting on your excitement with integrity and again factoring in obvious bodily feedback. I am hungry. I am full. I feel I wasn't going to get as good as a concrete answer. Well you can eat concrete if you wish. Perhaps that would contain the calcium you designed. What is it that you wish to hear from me? Well, I don't want to have fear that my body will not be as healthy and strong if I don't eat all the proper nutrients, but it's very time to be prepared. And you possibly keep track of what that actually is? No. All right. No. No. Are you already functioning on many assumptions already? Yeah, I read literature and I have no way of really knowing whether or not they say it's true, but it sounds reasonable and so I guess it is a buckshot beside the blind. But if I throw it all out, perhaps I won't be the healthy. No, I was just wondering what it should be. What I am expressing is if you are willing to trust yourself, you will not let yourself down. And it will be obvious because you will quote unquote feel well. Then there will be no question. Is that not the ultimate goal of all of this? To wake up, feel well as you say in your vernacular and go about your business effortlessly. That is. Oh, I am. You know I am. Really it not be obvious to you when that is not the case. No, you don't want to find out in say 20 years that your bones are weak because you didn't take something you should have. In my particular method of understanding and interpreting reality, that would have nothing to do with the previous 20 years since you recreate yourself completely in each and every given moment. And so perhaps you would create yourself in a given moment with a set of definitions of deterioration and then label or blame everything you had done here to for, but that would not be correctly the mechanism. And again, if you were deficient, you would feel it. My bones are a matter of my belief. Allow me to say in following your excites, I can perhaps say all of you invariably will be more physically active even in your own scientific understanding, if you will. The function of your bones ability to absorb calcium have to do with what you call the load placed upon the bones. When you are active, you in that sense, by the way, I'm indulging you. Use your muscles which then pull against your bones which increase the load upon your bones which then increase the demand will then allow you to bring in the supply. It is all interrelated. Simply saying only eating is simply not being aware that it is an equilibrium between what you call input and output, which is activity. Now I am not saying a robust high, but simply in following your excitement and going about your business, you will become more active. And individuals who feel that they are not that active invariably are not following their excitement a high percentage of the time. Are you familiar with Reiki, the ceiling that is going around in our society? I understand the reference. Going around, how interesting. I mean a lot of these wonderful things are coming to us. And one of the things in the Reiki training was that the energy that comes through us through our hands was into the food and so on that we eat. All right. If you wish it is all you, your consciousness and whatever way you wish to express it, shifting around, go right ahead. As long as I, if that feels right to me, then that's what is going to happen. You can create that effect if you wish. Again, there is a difference between wishing to express yourself wholly and fully and not wanting to be sick, whereby the emphasis is still on sick. So by maintaining your focus to the idea of wholeness that you're already a whole consciousness and by virtue of the fact that you are a whole consciousness, you express that wholeness through your physical body as well. Much of what we are discussing as preventative medicine is simply irrelevant. Preventative medicine comes from the idea of not wanting to be sick as opposed to choosing to express yourself fully and whole. Is that better? Yes. Oh, thank you. Thank you. Shelly. You are? Female. In talking about illness and health and that type of thing, I have a question concerning women in menopause. Women that are in transition, having experiences like hot flashes or excessive bleeding or whatever the physical change may come on during early years of menopause. Is there any, I mean they have hormones, supplements and treatments, they have natural herbs and things like that that we can take. But is that a way that we perceive ourselves at this time? I mean even though these physical changes are going on, can we change these? They change these reactions such as hot flashes or... We can change the expression of them in your relation to them. Yes. First and foremost, what you allow into your decision making process is the expectation that such a thing will happen. When anything similar seems to occur, many of you then self-fulfill the prophecy. Ah, this is what is happening. You open the book. Here is what I can expect and you join the club so to speak. The idea is that these changes do take place but in not having a negative expectation about them and subsequently a resistance to them. You will not need to create them in negative terms. For again, all pain and discomfort is simply resistance. Whether it is emotional, mental, spiritual or physical resistance rather than allowance and natural flow. So when that comes up, embracing it rather than resisting it, embracing it rather than resisting it and from whatever is available in that given moment choosing the thing that excites you the most and on your way rather than making that the center of your activity once you begin to feel it. You actually paint it red and feature it at that point. If you simply go about your business, whatever effects you are describing are simply minimal to zero. In other words, it is an sociological approach to those symptoms once they occur based on a rigid set of expectations generally then allowing you to break your own flow. I am going through this. I need to go over to the side and go through this rather than, well, this really excites me more. I am going to do this. Act on that. Then you are too busy. Does that make sense? Yes it does. Is that too easy and too good to reach through? Yes. Sounds fabulous. Can we try it? Second question I have is I have asked you before I have this cough. I still have it. You asked me to ponder what it is I may not be communicating. Did you do so? Yes. I have been communicating all over the place. I don't know my heart expressing myself. I still have this. Can you give me any more insight? What is it? You need not answer this out loud that you still have not communicated. That is a major thing in your life. It has to do with my job I feel is the only thing that I have left to communicate. Then that will be the next place in that sense to express yourself. For all right to use your expression you cannot fool Mother Nature. And before you ask this question was it not obvious to you that perhaps that was the answer? Well I have been honest about pretty much everything. Why do I pretty much still have a cough? Okay I got it. Also from time to time when in that sense you are in your quiet space whatever that represents to you be willing to take deep and loving breaths fully in fully out. And use in that sense your lungs to represent the equilibrium exchange that you consider exists between you and your environment which again is simply you and yourself. Simple exercise. Thank you. Thank you. Bye bye. Bye bye. I wonder if you could focus on my energy and when I was 19 or 20 I used to say that I was 19 or 20 or 20. I used to speak to extraterrestrials. In my mind I knew they were there and I had a great longing to leave earth. And then I saw a ship. He's broad. Well actually my friends saw most of it. I turned around and I saw a wheel of light. It's either four white lights and a red one in the middle light. I just saw it in a second. I need to describe it as sort of a diamond shape translucent. I'm going to mention I know this hovering above my parents house where I lived. What is your perception of the origin of these beings? I have no idea. Now now. Now now. Well I have an idea. Thank you. That was an example of where perhaps I would not allow your words to stand unless you insisted. Duplo scene. I never thought specifically that I would have decided where I thought maybe they might be Syrians because I like to swim and I have a great love of water and being underwater. I don't know. I thought there was a connection. Oh well. In asking you the question now. In this moment there is no other moment. What occurs to you now? Actually I just thought of the pre-idians. And I wrote a song and recorded it once mentioning pre-idians and in that recording a sound came in which I did not record. It was just a very steady hum which I always thought was very interesting. I took it as an affirmation that they heard the song and added. How are you telling it? And so. Oh and so what? That was my question. I thought perhaps you could ask me or ask somebody or just say by the way anybody can come into this energy and give this guy an answer like who are these guys that were answering my entreaties internally. I was just curious. I've always wondered about it. Specific seven. Have you found in addition, by the way we're all buddies? In addition to being attracted to the energy of our stream that you are also so attracted to other types of extraterrestrial streams. What would be the one you consider to be most attracted to? Most excited by? I don't know that many that much about it. From the choices that are aware that you are aware of. Thank you. Next shitting. I have a son who is very unhappy in his reality. Congratulations. Well he's so unhappy that he's tried to take his life several times. Oh and have you in that sense allowed this individual to get in touch with what excites? I think I have. Oh that would be my first suggestion. In understanding that when a person is not in alignment with the things that move them and enabled to act upon those things that is the type of frustration that occurs. When I have asked him what it is that excites him what he would like to do, he doesn't have an answer to that. He just says that he is very unhappy, he doesn't want to be here and that he doesn't feel he has the purpose here. Oh may I make a suggestion? Yes no maybe. Oh right. Present the idea that we had featured in the introduction of this interaction of the magic lamp and simply ask him, worry to have a magic lamp and can rub and have any wish he wants except dying what would it be that he would wish for to do and see what doors that opens. Do not invalidate anything that he says be willing to work with it. Sometimes in that sense individuals may seem to require some coaching but once you nail that exciting thing everything else will change. The only answer he has ever given me when I ask him questions like that is that he would like to be quote normal on the other side. But this is why I had phrased the question in asking him what it is that he would wish himself to be doing. And so this is a new approach. Do not walk into unless you insist the circumstance with all the baggage of what has happened up till now in this new moment present this new set of options and be willing to be creative if you wish to draw out and then support the things that move him. There are very specific things which do move him. Whatever he is consciously or unconsciously aware of them he is aware of them and you can draw them out. Some of them may seem to come up against what you call societal resistance but your willingness to assist him to enable himself to get into action to whatever degree that is possible about it again we will change the whole scene. It is simply a matter of being engaged that type of frustration has many different explanations and reasonings but generally the common theme of denying the purpose, denying the excitement making a separation that what excites you can't possibly be your purpose. It's frivolous your excitement. It distracts you from your purpose. These are many of the ideas that you are brought up with. However they are only one side of the coin that you are and when individuals begin to acknowledge what excites them the whole game as you say changes. And so be willing in that sense to be creative about drawing that out and then supporting it when it's on the table if you wish. Well thank you I have done nothing. Thanks. And to you good evening. I question ties in very much with the general theme of this evening. Once I ask the question please allow me two or three sentences to explain where I am on the subject. Always. The question is how do I most effectively manifest what I want in this life. Now let me say that I very much honor and respect the inputs I have and that is certainly don't focus or put thought or energy into the negative. Don't let energy and thought into the lack of what you want. Do the positive thing and put your energy like every day into here's what I want. Here's why I deserve it. Here's why it makes sense to me. Time and that all sounds pretty good to me. But I've had recently another idea and the idea is that there's sort of a subtle difference here in that identifying and focusing on what I want and the vocabulary sort of makes plain in a sense I don't have it now and therefore in a sense I am focusing and putting energy in that I don't have it and that that's the lack of it. That suppose instead I said more like an affirmation. I choose to be whole and healthy. I choose to have great abundance. I choose the relationships that satisfy me. Would that be more effective to have a look at it? That aligns you to your positive choice and that is the idea. Stating it as to who you are. Not constantly stating who you are not which still places emphasis on the not. So therefore these overall ideas are a very constructive way to remain focused and again with that as a foundation be mindful of the things that stand out as being exciting to act upon. That is merely the foundation. It is the actions that you take from your excitement with integrity that then would seem to move the reality to have that be in present time rather than often some distant future. But those are the qualities that would in that sense allow you to attract it most quickly. Primarily the idea that you are already whole and that whatever or whoever you attract will be a reflection of that whole. As opposed to individuals who think of themselves as half a being who needs to attract the other being their other half to be a whole. But again the faulty logic in that approach is that they always attract the person place or thing from a foundational feeling that they are incomplete. And so the person place or thing can only reflect back to them in completeness the foundation with which they attracted it. So stating yourself as already whole allows you to in that sense express that wholeness and attract reflections of the wholeness rather than the sense of lack. So the difference in words can make a difference that it is better to say I choose rather than I want. I choose is the more empowered statement I want implies built into it that it is something you don't have and therefore because you don't have it you must be at least slightly incomplete. Choice is more definite. Choice is more intentionful. Choice is what you make anyway because I remind you do not allow this to confuse you simply listen to it and allow it to seep in. I am complete. I am not complete. Are both true. They're both realities. They're both options. They both exist within the infinite potential. You cannot escape that they both exist and it is your strength that they both both exist not your weakness because the more options you have the more you have to choose from. And so therefore which one will you express? I am incomplete or I am complete and it will be up to you to decide in saying I choose you are very purposefully making that distinction creating that decision and that is again the more empowered way to go about it. I will not say better simply more empowered. But choosing him puts forth the idea that that's who I am right now because I choose it and I will choose something anyway so why not choose the thing I prefer to be and then have my actions be consistent with that choice. So then I am that person. You're getting. You're getting. You've confirmed what felt better to me. You simply described the idea of why choosing something from the positive is more empowering and pointed than not wanting something from the negative and keep reminding yourself of the thing you don't want. I'm reminding yourself that you want something because you don't have it now. But when you get that thing what is it you imagine that you will be that you are not now. Perhaps one of the things is happy. All right. Why not build happiness into the decision rather than having everything be a series of actions to become something that you are not you might as well decide I'm going to be happy right now. And so before I do anything allow me to gauge my actions so that my actions are reflective of a happy point of view of an already happy disposition. So I was about to do this certain thing is that a type of action which is reflective of happiness. Yes or no it will be obvious if it isn't don't do it. Find what will be an expression of the happiness if it is do it. But the idea is this is where you bridge the gap between the decision and the action and it again will appear to you that the actions are what make the difference. Now perhaps in some conceptual way we will get into certain distinctions and future interactions that the actions are actually not necessary. The reason we do not do that now is because you are all functioning from certain assumptions some of which are more perhaps again deep rooted than others. And for now the path of least resistance in the way that you express yourself is to factor in the action. But ultimately because you are an expression of consciousness and we will be able to discuss these distinctions at a later time actually shifting and making the decision is what really changes the reality. But I do not mean to confuse things by introducing that now. It's interesting to me that to really use and go in accordance with the laws of the universe sometimes it gets a little subtle and of course I love your analogy of hey you don't get rid of war by eating. All of you when deciding who you are and seeing the things that excite you and seeing yourself doing those things. So be mindful of what you feel that will bring you in terms of emotion in terms of the way that you look at yourself in terms of the way that you express yourself and interpret your reality and factor those into your decision now. You do not need to do anything to become something else. You become something and then you do something that is shall I say mechanically speaking the accurate order and even more literally believing or the belief that you express because you contain the both is seeing. So your willingness to express a certain belief consciously according to preference will allow you to create the evidence that supports that decision. So therefore aligning yourself to the positive as a choice because you are the transcendental observer who though you may see many of these options will eventually say I choose that one that is where your power lies and you always have the ability to gauge your response your responsibility which is before you act be aligned to who you are so that those actions are a reflection of that decision about who you are then the results of those actions can only also be an expression of who you are. Subtle distinctions yes difficult no no you already do it always have always will in some form while you are exploring physicality and so you have all the tools you need to express yourself as full conscious beings expressing your ability to create your reality consciously according to preference according to desire you have it all there is nothing to gain nothing to become that you are not already except your willingness to acknowledge choose and decide that aspect of yourself you do not become happy because something happens you choose happiness and then say well I chose it because that happened but ultimately you decide and so nothing is dangling before you unless you build into your decision the idea is dangling before me this is the degree of control that you have upon the expression of your reality the nature of how you create yourself as physical beings will still give you what we call the joy of unexpected outcomes outcomes that aren't exactly what you expected but as you walk in step with your intention as you walk in step with your positive decision unexpected they may be but negative they will never be interpreted as it will be a joy I wanted this result this happened instead and I like this much better that is what your relationship with the unexpected outcome will become it will become a reinforcement result at this time allow me to once again and for the first time thank you for your willing next to express yourselves in our direction as it were we appreciate this beyond what perhaps you are considering and feel as you say the desire to express to you that we unconditionally love you all and appreciate your willingness to interact with us in this way I thank you and Vidua most fond and lovely good evening.
