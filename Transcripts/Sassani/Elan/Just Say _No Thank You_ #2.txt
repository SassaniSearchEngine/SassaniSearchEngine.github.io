 All right, I'll say before we continue, allow for about a moment to again remind each and every one of you that what is before you now, though utilizing the reference of Bashar is actually a blended energy. Myself Bashar is only one third in a sense of the interaction. And another third the channel before you and the last so to speak third is another individual male upon my planet. That has in a sense been taking over more and more of the interactions. Most if not all of the introductory portions of these interactions from the session labeled thank you, thank you, has been almost solely by the other individual in this blending. So therefore you are already in that sense familiar with the other energy and it is an acclimatizing process. When I Bashar received entirely or so to speak entirely, there will always be a portion of my energy so to speak involved in these interactions. You may notice certain shifts, certain differences, but not much. What you have grown to enjoy in these interactions, the style of the presentation will be much the same because although we are individuals upon our planet and have our own individuality, there is a common approach, a common mass agreed upon idea. So therefore in general our energy will express through individuals from yours and other planets will tend to have a particular signature vibration, a particular style. So you may or may not notice the difference. The quality of the interactions will be at least equal and the idea is that there will be the allowance of new nuances because being a different individual, that individual will represent different ideas, have different strengths, different interests and in effect when taking over entirely these interactions at the beginning months of your next year, you can begin to inquire about some of these specifics. Very soon there will be a reference provided for that entity which we have simply referred to now as the other. The idea again being that we have no names upon our planet, we have no language and therefore the providing of a referential name is more for your purposes of identifying us as individuals. Therefore stay tuned. I would like to say welcome to the other entity. I am excited and really looking forward to always going to call it transformation, another transformation, another transformation for the channel as well as the other entity. Oh yeah. That will seem most obvious if you know in person. I would like to welcome this energy. And we thank you for that welcoming and again as well remind you that it has been going on for quite some time. Thank you very much. Che. Hi Bishar. Thank you. As are you bleeding. Thank you. I was wondering if the Dalai Lama really multiple incarnations of himself or do they just pick someone and say it's an incarnation? In a sense the former. Yes. Peace. Another question is the funeness of the number of entities channeling from Esipani to here. Is that because there aren't many people here ready to participate in channeling? Not real. As many individuals as are quote unquote ready and shall we say invite us to do so. There will be the idea of the accommodation of those numbers for the idea is that each individual entity does have the ability to channel through more than one individual. So therefore there are very few from our end that part taken this particular style of interplanetary communication and remember our population as a whole is also quite small at least in relation to yours approximately two hundred to two hundred and fifty million and that is all. Will there be more people more being channeling to earth? There already are but again all together it is somewhat of a small group. Approximately at this particular timing nine. Out of two hundred and fifty million yes. I have one other question. I've been noticing a lot of synchronicity in my life lately. Wonderful. Oh not you too. I was wondering does your higher consciousness help your physiological consciousness with synchronicity? Synchronicity is simply a given your higher consciousness perspective always realizes this and when your physical life self realizes that you are simply identifying more strongly with your higher consciousness. But understand again you need not make the separation that you reconnect to your higher consciousness that implies you are separate to begin with and you are not you are an expression of it one and the same just as your higher consciousness and your physical life self as well is a reflection of all that is an expression of it. I'd like to also share this. Two long ago I had a gynecological exam. Oh how exciting. Oh. It's nothing turned out that everybody got very excited about and I had to have a lot of feedback and then see a specialist a week later after the camp came back and through the whole thing I never got nervous and never felt fearful. I did not feel if I had created anything negative within myself and I never felt any negative feelings about the whole thing it turned out to be nothing and I was very this way. It transformed. It was something. It was a symbol it was an opportunity you took the ball in a sense and ran with it so to speak and now you have demonstrated to yourself from both ends your teeth and the other end that indeed you create your own real thing. Thank you. For a moment we thought you might be pregnant. No I'm not saying that. In a sense you are though with new ideas. Is that all? Yes I'll thank you. Thank you. Sharing. Yes. Fameo. Why are there only nine of you at this time? Simply because there is. There are nine individuals interested in this style of communication with your particular expression of reality. Is this that your civilization just doesn't really deal much with ours or most people don't care to or they don't know. The idea is they do other things. We are in communication with many civilizations many ideas on many levels. This is so to speak a put your foot in the water to get it wet type of approach whereby we would determine on a particular level that your civilization desires contact with our style of civilization but not as a whole. There are enough individuals within it build up enough momentum so that the beacon shall we say is seen so to speak by us. In that sense were there a need as earlier stated for more it would arise. Individuals would come forward willing to be in that exploration but for now again with the ability of one particular individual from our end to channel through several individuals usually three to five then there is a more of an aspect but right now all the representation that is requested unconsciously math unconsciously from your end is fulfilled. So simply there are enough. Okay so that nine is simply the amount that are dealing with our civilization or a different group dealing with other civilizations. Yes. All right great thank you. And who you should. Sure. Hey. Me on the next. Ben. Why is it that roughly two thirds of your two hundred and fifty million population is normally not on your planet but orbiting around somewhere. The idea is exploring many aspects of the multiverse and again the idea is that part of our pension to part of our main interest is associating and sharing of information. Much better done off your planet and in your spaceships if you're in this particular timing in our society yet. Second question. I have two friends roughly my age who have a twenty four year old son who not quite two weeks ago was his body was found that in the water at the foot of a cliff in San Francisco area apparently he had been jogging that Sunday afternoon and I believe the very next day was when his body was found. Are you able and willing to tell me whether it might be what we call simply an accident because there were blows to the back of his head in his chest that could have maybe come from an accident or might he have been the victim of what we would call foul play. Thank you for asking at this time we simply have no perspective on the matter and when in that sense information is not available immediately to us we simply understand it is not our domain but thank you for asking. Thank you. There are others who will assist those individuals however. Say that. Die. Do we go to a no density state not the place we create but in beyond the place we create. In a non physical state with a root or an anchor in the third and fourth density still associated strongly because of the idea of karmic momentum that you create with the density that you have just created. Now there is again as you become more aware of the idea that whatever you believe upon upon your death will be what you experience for in that non-physical realm. There is no corresponding time between the having of the thought and the manifestation of the experience. You can change, shall we say, what the tendency has been altogether. But if you allow yourself to simply quote unquote automatically participate in that transition, in general there is an apparently that you have an anchor, so to speak, a root to the third transitional force. Did that answer the question? Yes, part of the question. The other part of the question is how can we and do we and can we find be with someone who is already passed over? Do you mean now or when you have passed yourself? Yes, both. The idea is now you can invite initiate and be willing to accept the timing of the communications from them again, not as a derogatory statement, but individuals in that realm have better things to do than hang around and wait till you call. They are quite active, quite busy. It is a reality as well. So the idea is according to timings, you may be able to when passing yourself if the timing is such that another particular individual has not chosen to reincarnate, so to speak, create the experience of spending some quote unquote time with them. Yes. Thank you, Chair. Oh, one other question. Oh, your special. Scout, your scout ship. Is that come off an assembly line or does that come out of your mind? In a sense, you would understand it to have been constructed. The idea is not so much assembly line that rigid, but of course there was first the desire for such a craft. So therefore you could say initially the idea came from the mind, the desire of the pilot, but the idea is there are simply individuals upon our climate whose excitement is to build such things and therefore the bottom line, anyone who wants one gets one. There is a physical representation of the style of building. Very briefly for this is somewhat available through your cassette tape. The idea is that we create an energy template, which you may say is a mold of sorts, upon which is literally grown a style of crystalline structure that then conforms to the specifics laid down by the template. And in a sense you may say, and again this is very loose because there is not exactly a translation. You do not have this technology, but according to the template laid down, the material grown upon the template simply when completed has embedded within it all the relationships of crystalline ideas and structures to allow there to be what you would loosely label a symbolic form or a symbolic form of machinery. Did that trumpets? That sounds like a lot of fun. Oh yes. Oh, I am too huge. For sure. Ace, man. I have a question. I have a friend who goes up to Northern New Hampshire quite a bit. And there is a very remote area of New Hampshire and he went into a cave once he told me and it was during the day that the cave was pitch dark and he was just exploring it and I just recently read a book talking about underground caverns or caves that interconnect between different cities and civilizations of Lemorian and Atlantean descendants. My question is, is this particular cave which you said had no bad sinid or any kind of life of bears or anything, is there is a split off? Does a cave go on into any particular realm of that thinking? In a sense, you can say that particular chambers are resonant structures that allow there to be what you might loosely label particular interdimensional gateways or doorways. In this particular cave, which I have or this cavern or chamber, a doorway to that particular situation? In a sense, yes, though you would access walking through that doorway through the center of your being or consciousness, not so much physically. Therefore, you would in a sense attune your vibration in identification or synchronization with the natural residential vibration of the chamber itself. Continuing on with one other question, in that area, he goes up there every weekend and the last few months he had sightings of, well he called them UFOs and it was also the one UFO right near his cabin or his remote area where he was staying every weekend. Can you elaborate anything on the type of civilization that is operating these crafts? Well first of all, remember Bashar's rule of thumb about UFO sighting, which again to us are UFOs, but the idea is for the purposes of having a methodology to proceed with conviction when you see something in your sky that you deem to be a spacecraft, unless you are absolutely sure beyond the shadow of a doubt that it is, it isn't, even if it is. If you keep that idea in mind, you will not in a sense spend much of your time gazing and needing to see such a thing and increase your likelihood of attracting an actual interaction. All we will say about that area is that from time to time there is activity there and not be more specific than that. I have no more questions but I have a friend of Gus that questions behind me. Alright, you share. Yes, I just, do you believe that a man named Jesus Christ ever walked his earth? Yes. What do you believe that Jesus Christ was? In a sense, a master, a son of God whose purpose was to show you all that you are all the sons of God and who did not say, I am the only way all other ways are no good. But said, if you act as I act, you will embody the same divine idea within you and express it in your action. There's two more questions. Alright. Does your means appropriation the same way that we have our planet earth define your means of giving birth the same, you have the same similar though painless for there is the enlistment of the aid and assistance of the individual being born. We understand that individual to be a soul and are in contact telepathically with the soul prior to the conception and the birth. One last question. Would you classify yourself what we would call you as an extraterrestrial? Yes. Okay. Extra dimensional extra terrestrial. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Charles, within the past couple of years, you and others have told us that there were some things going on that represented an acceleration down here of a lot of energies that we were attracting. And one of the things that we noticed down here was that assimilating those energies was causing at the time, at least in parent, difficulty for a lot of people. As well as many reconciliations and positivity, but do go on. Well, what I've noticed was that there was a lot of difficulty for many people and were recently many reconciliations and positive events. And it feels like a lot of things are resolving that had been put in motion during the recent time. I mean, really on a global basis, I think, as well as individually. And I was wondering what you might have to say about where we are now finding ourselves in this acceleration. It doesn't feel nearly as disrupted as it did, but say a year or two ago. Well, perhaps the idea is you are getting used to the idea and beginning to acknowledge that perhaps something is going on. And the idea is something is something quite big in terms of not following what would seem to be a momentum of 25,000 years of style of consciousness. This is what we refer to as your transitional age, the age of the transformation of your style of consciousness. This, as individuals, in a sense, one at a time, click over to this new form of consciousness, begins to create a mass momentum behind the actual change. And when there is a certain threshold that, by the way, has already been reached, and what you are now sensing as the reconciliations are simply outer reflections of that threshold having been reached. And again, things will now begin to occur that absolutely seemed impossible but ten of your years ago. And in fact, as early as your 1986 year, things have occurred since the 87 year that absolutely would seem to have not been possible in your life. You have seen nothing yet. In a sense. That's wonderful. Now, when in our timing would you say that that threshold was reached? In 1987. When that in line somewhat with what you label the harmonic convergence. And you are now, in a sense, in a period of cycle of energy, civilization-wise, that you would call the harmonic identification. Is that all? Thank you. And to you. Shredding. Shredding. Is leading. Greetings. Shredding. Is what we know as humanity native to this planet. In a sense, native in terms of defining the emergence of your style of human consciousness. Yes. But in an overall sense, you are all eternal. So therefore, are from nowhere in particular you are from wherever you are right then. What typically did humanity evolve on this planet or was it a life form or type of experiment that was seeded here by another civilization? First of all, from our perspective, you are nobody's experiment. You are nobody, though the mechanism of the infusion of your consciousness, which you may for the purposes of illustration only, this is quite colloquial, consider to have been a mass association of all the individual consciousness having chosen a particular style of physical exploration and found a planet with a conducive phylogeny to enable yourself to experience that type of exploration. But the seeming missing link arises from the idea that there was a physicalized evolution of sorts up to a certain point. What you perceive to be the jump was that consciousness finding a conducive home, infusing into those particular entities or being and the jump occurred when that consciousness infused with the body style. Immediately, there was a jump in genetic material corresponding to the new consciousness because again, physicality is a reflection of consciousness. So when you infuse a new consciousness in a particular physicality, in an immediate style, you immediately get particular corresponding physical changes. Did that translate? Thank you very much. Are there specific extraterrestrial civilizations who have taken an instrumental role in facilitating our creating this experience? Not so much. More observed portions of the process and in a particular instance participated in a tangential idea altogether. So what you're saying is that we as individuals created ourselves. Oh, yes. When we had spoke about earlier the creator, if you would like to seem more accurate, you would say that all that is created you. You created the reality you are experiencing in a sense. Again, this is removing something which can truly never be removed, but in a sense it illustrates an idea. And following on that question, are we here, we who are on the planet today, do we all come from other civilizations in our, if you will, past? In a sense, yes. You can say that. And perhaps it's because of that that these other civilizations are interested in what's going on here and how the program's developing. In particular instances, yes, it is, shall we say, one of the reasons for the observations, yes. And when we make the transformation to fourth density, will humankind, as we know it, move on, or will there be another wave of human type of creatures in the third density, protecting of that experience? Well, the idea is that when you move to fourth density, you will still seem to be a style of human upon a particular planet which may or may not retain the name Earth. When in that sense you progress, so to speak, not that it's better, simply goes in a linear line to non-physical fifth density there will seem, in a sense, to be a style of consciousness that will replace, in a sense, your population upon this planet. Again though, when speaking about being in fourth density and having third density being then come in, remember again that your reality is only one of an infinite number of parallel and alternate reality. And many of them literally exist in what you would call overlapping space, but never perceive each other because your idea of continuity is made up of discrete on-off moments and your off-moments simply would be the on-moment of another reality. Therefore coexisting in the same space and never being aware of each other due to differences in vibration, being out of sync, so to speak, with the on-off flashpoint and also having different time frame references all together. That's good other question. You have stated that you as a race of beings are a hybrid between the zeta reticular and the humans of us. In a sense, you are our children. You've also said that you as a civilization have existed for approximately 12,000 of our years and that you are loosely translated 300 years in our future on another timeline. Could you address the mechanics of just how that was done? It's two ideas. First of all, though you have been aware most recently of the zeta reticulum interaction upon your planet, it has in fact been occurring for thousands of years. First of all, second of all, our time stream in one of the definitional reasons for why we exist in a different dimension than yours is ten times faster than yours. So therefore what you perceive to be 30 years is 300 years of our history. When we interact with you in this manner, there is a synchronization for the purposes of this interaction. I see. Does that make sense? Yes. The transformation itself takes place in this timeframe. In a sense, no. Perhaps more accurately, a portion of the process by definition. I see. So it's not like the... My understanding was the zeta reticulum came down, they interacted with human beings, and the offspring of that interaction was the hybridization at the time. Some of the offspring, yes. Right. So that takes place in this timeline, in our timeline. The actual acquisition, so to speak, yes. The actual, shall we say, nurturing process, no. How is it that you take that actual offspring and move it into another timeline? How is that done? In other words, I mean... It is a relative idea. It's a thing to take in a hand-dad ability to shift timelines? In a sense, yes. Not as much as us, but there is that ability, and we will explain that more in the future of interaction. But when it says you have free incentives, both your parents, in a sense. In a sense. Thank you. Sherry. Yeah. Hi. First off, I wish to clearly extend the invitation to Delmane Cisani, who would like to be more of a Delmane Cisani, who would like to speak their feet in the water. Oh, thank you very much. It has been received. And recently, and reading a book about UFOs, and he goes back in history on a lot of facious descriptions from old records and fan scripts. But one thing taught my attention in recent history about the Aztec civilization, a person by the name of L'Enlan Cisunima, had made a two-gold plate, breast plate, specifically for the king and queen of stangs, and given to his conqueror named Cortez. The gold plates supposedly were meant to be worn, and they were made of specific dimensions for these two particular individuals. And from the way it spoke, it was that if they put these gold plates on, they would fly. And I was wondering if you could explain that or sound upon that a little bit more. Briefly beyond here, they are symbolic and would need, shall we say, a corresponding belief system on the wearer. So therefore, in that particular instance, such a belief system did not exist. Even if they had it, it is unlikely they would have had that effect for their beliefs were not such that would accept such an idea. The idea is there would be a reaction or an interaction of resonances, vibratory frequencies, that in that sense would tend to have the effect of nullifying gravity. Now the vibratory frequency is, because that is all. The atomic structure. Interacting and intermingling with your own electromagnetheric field around your body, what you label your order. So what could actually do that without the use of a V or a tool? Yes, but again, you would in that sense allow yourself quite an opportunity to look at your truest beliefs. Now I understand that, but I know that these things were produced and obviously in folklore and history people think why would these gold plates? In a sense, one of the ideas again is that that provided an acceptable symbol whereby an individual, exercise their already existing ability to do such a thing, but had a solid excuse to be able to do so. It was not the symbol and it was not in effect the tool itself that actually allowed the idea, though there was the complete rationalization of why it would work. That is one of the things that allows you to meld your belief systems in such a way to allow you to change them in such a drastic fashion from the mass agreed upon idea. So if we take our belief systems and change our belief systems, then our rate of vibration will change. By definition, when your actions reflect your new beliefs, yes. But you cannot vibrate at a different, say, level or frequency if you are of the same belief system. If your belief systems don't change, then therefore your vibrational frequency will not change. Yes, and again, view your reasons as well as your beliefs for wishing to do so and also the reasons that you wish not to do so, which often are the aspects that are not looked at. There are actually reasons individuals choose not to. If you will look at them, you will get them inside. Thank you very much. And, Chef, there are, I have been reading a book where it is the Free Federation of Representatives, and then there is your association of worlds or planets. They are more or less interchangeable companies. Okay. Interactions, is it possible for any of the people listening in the other worlds right now to come in and ask, or if we have a name of a person that we know about through our readings to ask that person to come forth and see how they're doing out there? From time to time, that will occur spontaneously, not this evening. So it is possible. And again, we also represent as ambassadors in the association of worlds altogether. So, therefore, there is always many as there are on your end, on our end, listening in. And there will be from time to time particular contributions from particular other aspects of the association. When we are accessing them many times, we will simply say one moment. And in that space, much of that interaction occurs. Other times it will be directly spontaneous. There will be many new aspects to these channelings beginning your next year. So, do we have to wait till next year? I say I want to stay low to Auroranes or to Aztar, who is, I believe, one of the other commanders. The idea is message received, there is nothing right now to be communicated back. And to you. This is part of the process of acclimatization that is occurring within the channel for there are also belief systems within the channel himself. And these ideas being brought to the surface are aiding and assisting for a more open style of communication in which anything will be possible. We thank you. Sure. For sure. Over there. Hi. And who is? At first time at something, at having a serious life. It is my first time as well. And I thank you. I have been experiencing most of my life. You know, too, I guess the average person out there is unexplainable things have occurred. How are you talking? Yeah. You do not sound convinced? I'm not getting the message. I'm not accepting the message. Whatever is, whatever is coming, assuming I'm not accepting. I'm shutting it off. I'm laughing at the something. Can you provide an example? Perhaps we can assist. Well, in my home, I'll hear running footsteps. I'll hear sounds as though there is someone running right through a glass door. And it sounds just like the person. It's just like going right through and breaking the glass and running right out onto the porch. And there's nothing there. I don't see anything. When you perceive this reality, which by the way is no less real than yours, though the definition is different obviously, what is your perception at that time? I am afraid. Why? I guess just the unknown. Or? I think I'm just so afraid all of the time. Is there an idea that the unknown in and of itself is inherently fearful? Do you know what you are about to say? Me. What do you mean? What do you mean? Whatever that says. Right now. No? Yes. Or are you making it up? Oh, no. Am I making it up? No. No. The idea is that there are many examples in your life of embracing the unknown. And it is simply a definition that there need be fear of the unknown rather than the unknown simply being a friend dropping by. But these are always opportunities. All emotions are the direct result of a belief system. So whenever you feel something, it is always the opportunity particularly if it seems to be a negative feeling because all feelings are neutral and you are simply labeling it negative, your tendency to do so will always key you in to a particular belief that you have. Now, from our perspective, you do as well as you all do at the same time, paradoxically, create your own reality. All of it. So therefore, there is no outside and there is no shall we say idea that can sneak in and get you. So perhaps this is one of the ideas that you are now bringing to the surface of your consciousness to begin to integrate. If you understand what we had earlier shared that you can only experience the reality that you are the vibration of, you can begin to simply take for granted that if you are experiencing it, it has a positive or a negative significance to you, but 100% potential for both. So therefore, you have in that sense, focused on the negative aspect. Now begin to shift slightly and cut yourself some slack as you say and begin to determine what is positive about it. For instance, the ability in that sense to begin to sense realities that are alternate to yours by some individuals would seem quite expanded. Is there some particular aspect of the fear involved that you can share? I guess basically what you said before, that I feel like there is something that's coming to get me. Well, the idea is that there is no outside and it is you. You are literally breaking through to other trains of thought, other styles of beingness. And though it can be, as shall we say, shattering as breaking glass, it need not be so tumultuous. You could open the door first, you know. But the idea is that it is symbolic of the willingness to take such a step. Now if you would like a suggestion, which is all this is, we never say you should do this, you should do that, you know best. The idea is when you next seem to experience such a thing, remember I have attracted this and there is as well as fear within it, something positive for me. Perhaps if you wish you can issue an invitation, who is there? What do you want? Welcome in, would you like some tea? Time, if you simply ask, I will open the door and you need not crash through it. This idea, working with it rather than allowing it to work against you. Also again, when you feel the fear at the moment you are feeling it, because part of the significance is that you are feeling it in that moment, begin to look at what you are believing and begin to remind yourself there is no outside. Everything is a reflection of you. What does this help? Oh yes, very much. Thank you very much. And to you as well, for barreling into new reality. And we thank you. Shady, mail, then all the matter. I have had several experiences that I would hope you would comment on. Hope implies down, very good start. I had several experiences. I had several experiences that I would appreciate your comments. Oh, all right, perhaps. When I was eight, up in the back pasture, with my two cousins, I saw what two and eight year old look like a seven foot red bird man with very big yellow eyes. Do you have any reading on that particular experience? Yes. Would you share it with me, please? To some degree, it was a direct contact. It was a catalyst, if you will, something that you will interact with again, which will seem in that sense to bring back memories in between then and now, or the now that you have, the particular experience I am speaking of. And much of this in that sense will become more apparent. But the idea is what you would label extra terrestrial in origin of that style of consciousness and relate directly to what you would label a past existence. Do you know that civilization is being represented? The only symbol that appears when you ask is simply the word central sun, and that is all. Thank you. In Georgia in 1970, for approximately an hour, I was in telepathic communication. The ET intelligence that was in a craft right over the car, could you comment on that, please? If you will share your most dearly held perspective, yes, I will. During that time, the communication between us had to do with an exchange of information and viewpoints. And my sense was that the beings were feeling me out as to who I was, and at the same time I was feeling them out and very curious as to who they were. What did you find? At one point, I communicated that if they were about facilitating and expanding human potential, that I was at their disposal 100% to do whatever I could to facilitate the process. If, however, they were about any type of regimentation or subjugation that I would have. It startling, like it was a snap in my head, and it started me to the point where I slammed on the brakes of the car and caught my passenger from going forward. Who, by the way, was in visual contact with the craft while I was in mental contact with at least one of the audience. What was that individual's physical description? The person in the car with me? The female, approximately the same age as my son. No, the audience. What did she describe having seen? Oh, I see. Excuse me. It was at night. This sighting was at night. She said it was a large, round saucer with lots of lights. One last question. What was your perception of the reason for the abrupt discontinuation of the communication in that particular moment? My interpretation in that moment was that for now the communication was complete. Did you in any sense feel that to be an answer to your question about their intention? I've considered such. What is your strongest leaning? Beyond? My strongest leaning is that that particular civilization and myself did not share in all instances the same sense of ethics. Why? Why was that your conclusion? It was not my conclusion. I considered. At the time, my conclusion was that for now the communication is over. I considered the possibility that it was because of my absolute rejection of being part of any program that involved regimentation in any way, that that was the reason why it was severed, the communication was severed. But that's not my conclusion. Our perspective is that that would not be the conclusion. Probably your first idea, that was simply all that needed to be rendered at that time. Though we usually refrain from doing so, so there is not the idea of obsession or fixation on a particular label, the timing is such that we can share with you that our strongest sensing of that particular set of interactions, words chosen carefully, was pre-avian in nature. One final thing? Oh. In 1972, later in 1972, in going up, coming out of Denver into the Rocky Mountains, for a period of time, I was out of my jeep. I was taken out of my jeep. One moment. There is another that will assist you with this. Do you have any concept of that direction of that other? It would help me explore this? Yes. All right. Pursue it. We will speak again. And who you. Over there. For sure. Yes. All right. And who you are breathing. Some say, that's been going on lately. All right. Thank you very much. I don't know exactly what I need. I do have some questions though. All right. Perhaps you do not need anything and simply wish to share. Well, apparently I don't need my truck anymore. Apparently not. Because I re-posedipped it last week. Well, one way to get a symbol out of your yarn. Not the only way. Not the only way. No. It's interesting because I really have said about it at first and drank a lot of coffee and smoked a lot of cigarettes. And I think I have a pattern worn in my carpet from all pasting. You are not alone. Okay. No, I'm not alone. There's others that are going through similar situations. And have similar patterns upon their cars. What happened when I thought was wild was while they're telling this thing out of the driveway, I looked at it and just went, boy, that's over with. And it was like, what a relief. And I started taking a look at that. Why is this happening? And part of it, stuff I came up with, is that the thing was actually just a status symbol. I don't need it. And then I'm restructuring my basis of operation. And that it was because of this need to have new stuff all the time that I got looking at it. And it's not me anymore. I don't need that. So, you know, be gone with it in good reasons. There's still some money to pay on it, but I'm not really worried about it anymore. And it freed me up in other ways of using my energies. The idea also that may be helpful as you have now created a void. And as you say, nature abodes such a void. It will be filled, but it will be a matter of keeping your eyes open to a particular unconventional seeming opportunity and then acting upon the opportunity. Not just waiting around for another truck to drop on you. But the idea will require some action on your part that if you will but reflect at that time, you will find to be quite effortless. But it will require that you wear a pattern in another direction other than your carpet. You will need to move into the opportunity. Any more specific on that? Oh, no. The specifics are the fun part. Yeah. Okay. That's cool. I can do that. So is that why, like, I kept working overtime. I was making money, but it didn't go anywhere. It was gone. I was trying to keep my integrity and by paying all my bills that I was supposed to pay. And I couldn't do it anymore. I couldn't believe that I could no longer afford these things. And it's just like the bottom just dropped out. In a sense. But that simply allows you to lay down a new body. And also to reflect on the idea of your own sense of your own status. Thereby not needing any particular symbol to remind you of it. For it is irrevocable. It is constant. And your status is personal. Therefore, live it. Be it. And you will find a new outer reflection that will represent the new you. You can look at it as a loss or you can now look at it as an opportunity. Again, avoid that by definition will be filled. Thank you very much. And you as well. There will be but a few more sharing. Sharing. However, we do sense that there are one or two more sharing. All right. Two. First you. Thank you. Be sure. I'll be here to rescue one more. Oh no. No one is drowning and in that sense that is one of the reasons for our approach of interacting with you in this way. When we interact with you in this way, you only have the weight of the information that is coming out itself and nothing else. It is not in any way, shape or form important to us that you believe that we are who we say we are. As we have noticed a pension in your society for paying so much attention to the messenger that you don't listen to the message. So the idea is we do not wish to function in the capacity where you will give your power away. We will not save you for instance for there is the notion that extra terrestrial will come down and save mankind for we all understand you are not drowning. You are exploring and beginning now to be conscious about taking it back. Yeah. Go on. I was just getting a little more personal than extra terrestrial. Well, this does not mean that you cannot see an opportunity as we had discussed earlier to be of service and render that service to another individual, but it is not rescuing them. If you did not come along they would have found another way. So it is just a matter of what attention individuals are willing to place and the definition that individuals are willing to assign to the circumstances they create. When a child, when your child who is maybe in her 30s finds yourself in trouble, how would you do to just stand back and watch the whole thing or do you just go in your leg gain busters and say, let's get home and straighten up. Or do you just let them flounder and flounder when you see that it's debilitating. Well, first of all, we do not create that idea at all within our society. So from our perspective, there is not a commonality, but our suggestion would be to simply again give the gift of who you are without needing to force it down the throat of the recipient. And this means that you give yourself the opportunity to be of service to say in a sense who you are and then allow them if they wish to choose it, if they don't allow them to choose what they will, which by the way they will anyway, and then they will have a particular result to their actions and begin to create a cause and a fact relationship and perhaps choose to not do that thing again. But again, you can only be responsible to them by being responsible for yourself, which means defining who you are and boldly moving with conviction about who you are. Is there something more specific or does this help? No, thanks, Bishar. All right. And over there. Good evening. And I've been having an engagement in the definition of a couple of words of arrogance and ignorance. Oh, right? In what regard? Well, in what regard is that I had thought that at one time through Andrew, you had said something about arrogance and ignorance being too major block to transformation or change. Perhaps through Daller. Was it Daller? I didn't know if it was through Andrew or through. But briefly, our definition for again that was in a particular context which simply does not exist right now. Arrogance would simply be the notion by an individual that their way is the only way. Their truth is the only truth and all other truths stink. There is an attitude that arises from this particular frame of mind that you label arrogant. Ignorance can be, in a sense, also a judgment for, in a sense, you know it all. Though when you embody yourself physically, you only choose to explore a particular portion of your totality. And you can therefore, by convention, say that you are either consciously or more often unconsciously ignoring the rest of your totality. Ignorance. Therefore, that is a choice. It becomes a judgment when another individual comes along and says, this is something everyone must know, must pay attention to, and you do not, therefore, you are ignorant, dumb, stupid, etc. There is a false word. Oh, thank you very much. Thank you, Arrogance. Arrogance. I've been exploring my own experience with both. Oh, safely. When provided the reflection that you would consider of those ideas from another, show them your alternatives. The opposite of arrogance would be the willingness to embrace all viewpoints, take the pages of their story that fit in your book, put it in your briefcase and beyond your way. And the idea, again, of realizing that individuals who are, quote, unquote, ignorant of some particular thing are quite genius in another thing. So it is simply a matter of focus, simply a matter of choice, simply a matter of attention. If you reflect Arrogance back to an arrogant person, you reinforce the idea that they must be right. There is only one way, but it's not yours from their perspective. When you reflect back to them, a willingness to embrace all viewpoints, in general, at first they're a bit dumbfounded. But they see that that is also possible, and that is why it is of service to them. And I think that's because that in terms of the ignorance of someone having an arrogant point of view that this is the only way. And if you don't take my point of view, you are ignorant. An exploration of that that I've seen has put that more on positive flow. I would say, yes, I am ignorant. I have chosen, I know your reality, and I have chosen to ignore it on a conscious level. Thank you very much. Or no, thank you. And the idea, again, being that I appreciate your perspective. I do not agree with it, and I embrace your right to have that perspective. Thank you for sharing it with me. Goodbye. And to you as well. Sure. In the Middle East, we're seeing a great transformation of conflicts becoming peaceful between different tribes of people that live in the Middle East. And the U.S. seems to be sending their ambassadors, so to speak, over there, and bringing this peace process together, which I think is wonderful. And you see this as part of the transformational process that we're now in. And how do you perceive the Middle East in terms of the future of 1992? Shall we say we will be watching and observing from our end. There will be many times that we are, quote, unquote, in the neighborhood, and this will be one of the focuses of our observation. Therefore, we will make no predictions. And again, remind you, there is no such thing as a prediction of the future, simply a sensing of the energy available. And there may be a little bit more shaking up in that area, but the bottom line is that it is all leading toward an accelerated integration, no matter how, in a particular isolated time frame, it may look. But what you are seeing from our perspective is quite positive and quite integrative. That's an exception I get. I sense very strongly that a wonderful thing is occurring there. And as you say, there might be little ruffles here and there, but it seems overall that there's finally a connection between conflicts of ancient history that have been going on for centuries there, finally coming to a point of co-understanding. We agree. Thank you. And to you as well. At this time, allow us once again in the triad before you to thank you for your willingness and in that sense your ability to co-create such an interaction as this. Again we do not insist that you believe that we are who we say we are. We cannot empirically prove that to you anyway. I will leave it to your sense of discernment to decide your explanation for what is occurring. What is important to us is that you are not here by accident. Each and every one of you who are present, even if you never attend another type of interaction such as this, have gotten some portion of the gift that we have to offer. Now we do not insist or qualify what you must take from it for there are no much, there are no shoulds. But we do appreciate that on some level in order for you to be co-creating this with us you have agreed to at least interact with our stream of consciousness. For this we thank you and again remind you that whatever you perceive you have gotten from us has simply been reflected back to you you already contained it to begin with and also remind you that we are enriched as well in these interactions. So for your willingness to share the gifts that you are with us in an unconditional manner we thank you most fond and loving women. Wish you pleasant dreams and a fond and loving good evening.
