 Greetings and welcome this evening of your time as you create time to exist. How are you all? Are you all alive? Oh, thank you. Allow me to proceed and entitle this interaction. It takes one to know one. Allow me to begin in the following way. Very often we will speak to your society as the creators of your reality that you are and in communicating this idea to you explain that you can only experience the reality. You can only experience the results or have the experience that you are the vibration of. From time to time there will arise some confusion from members of your society as to exactly what does the vibration of me and perhaps that is a fair question. The idea is that as consciousness which is what you are in your pristine state, in your natural state, you are energetically speaking expressed as a frequency or a vibration within the overall primary frequency you call God and we call all that is. So therefore in one sense you may say that your particular expression, your particular statement is a vibration and the difference in that vibration, the difference in that frequency determines the distinct and discrete personality that you are. Now this is all well and good and perhaps sounds nice but it is also quite practical for in a physical world though you are consciousness you create certain ideas that are distinct in physical reality. One of those ideas is what you call time and a timeline and unfolding along that timeline but being again that this is physicality, physical action is the ultimate expression in this life of your vibration. Physical action is the expression of the statement of who you are in any given moment. Physical action is the ultimate evidence of a belief that you hold for you truly when you say you create your reality according to your belief, do so through the mechanism of action for you act as though you believe something. You act as a person who believes a particular belief and it is those actions that midwife the belief into reality. So therefore whatever you do in any given moment and in what you call succession of moments determines a particular expression or a particular version of your vibration and when you change your actions you will change a component shall I say of your vibration. Now understand one component so to speak of your vibration is constant or consistent and perhaps you can call that your signature vibration that is the aspect of you that allows you to know no matter how you change physically and the physical world seems to change around you that you are still the same you. So that sense of being who you are is the core of your vibration, your signature vibration but the surrounding shall I say component of your vibration is changing and is expressed again according to the actions of your life. So when I say you can only experience the reality that you are the vibration of one other way to interpret this is that you can only experience the reality that you act like or act as if it is most likely. So therefore it is not that you are a slave to your belief for until you act upon those beliefs nothing happens they simply stay there in the mental so to speak plain and the good news in this idea is that you can explore any mental idea any belief that you wish without performing the actions and not have a physical effect or an experience from it you can therefore very safely explore your beliefs look at the things that you believe and again as long as you do not act upon them you will not create them and can simply evaluate view them and see if they are still the beliefs that you wish to hold in your mind. So therefore the vibration that you are is the reality that you experience and in that sense it takes one to know one you must be one in order to know or see something now allow us to expand it a bit further for one other thing that you can understand very often you will assume that you learn things that you did not know now from one perspective this may seem accurate but from the perspective of your infinite self everything already exists within you. So from that perspective you simply remember things you already knew and have chosen to place an amnesia on yourself to explore from a different angle and experience as if anew but you already contain everything again in your pristine in your natural what you sometimes call in your soul state. So therefore you may understand when you feel that you learn something or when you feel that something rings true with who you are something is stated and it really means something to you or someone said something that brings you great joy. In order to understand that in order to make sense of it you must already on some level contain that idea in order to know it you must be that idea. So therefore when hearing information that you find most helpful or most joyful from any source not limited to but including us you need not ascribe a compliment to us or to the source now you can acknowledge that that source was the trigger but you can understand that we give nothing to you we literally teach nothing to you we simply allow you through trigger to remember what you already know and when you see again something that you find quite joyful you can in that sense affirm or acknowledge that a particular source may have triggered that but the point here is that you can also pat yourself on the back for you understood it it made sense to you meaning that you contain it on our now remembering what you already know again from the perspective of your eternal self you never truly learn anything new you simply remember and reincorporate ideas that you have chosen to forget through exploration through the viewpoint of your physical self we understand that it seems that you were an empty slate that then was filled as your life went on but that is part of the exploration in and of itself imposing such a forgetfulness that you actually can learn or seem to learn that you can actually discover something as if a new that you can actually experience the joy of surprise not knowing what is to come next for when you are all knowing and when you are expressing your all knowing that these things do not exist you cannot discover anything you know it all you cannot learn anything you know it all and you cannot be surprised for it is all evident and nothing can create up and surprise you in that way so one of the reasons that you even create a physical reality is to explore the joy of discovery itself you literally forget everything in order to enjoy the process of remembering it and experiencing it as being fresh as being new as being fascinating as again being unexpected and this is part of the joy of the choice that you have all made to forget 99.999% of who you are and if you begin to look at it this way and begin to get down to the business of being curious and fascinated by your reality you will begin to truly glean why you have chosen to be here for when you say I was put here or I am stuck here you are simply not acknowledging your hand in choosing to be here and when you do not acknowledge it you remove your ability to change your creations for if something is happening to you where is the power the power is in the external reality if you understand that it is happening from you in the way that we are sharing it hands you back the power and you can then change it if you don't like the way it is for again your actions always express your truest belief we have explained many times that as discrete personalities perhaps one way that you can look at it is that you are a prism you break down the white light of infinite creation or the white light of your soul or higher self through the three sided prism of your belief emotions and thoughts these are the ideas that make you a distinct individual that assist in shaping your vibration but again ultimately it is the actions performed that create physically the manifestation of that vibration we have also discussed that because emotions and thoughts are always a result of a belief that you can use your emotions and you can use your thoughts to trace back to beliefs that you may have bought into unconsciously and when you then acknowledge those beliefs they are now conscious and the acknowledgement and allowing them to be conscious allows you to choose new beliefs for you cannot choose new beliefs in denial of the old but only in acknowledgement for that acknowledgement equalizes the weight of that belief to all other beliefs so you can use your emotions to trace back what you believe and again we have discussed this quite often what we have not always then extrapolated and continue to discuss is that you can also do so by allowing your actions to be an obvious window to your beliefs for again you always act as if you believe something you do not act in a vacuum you always act with a foundational fundamental belief emotion and thought so therefore you can also use your actions as a reflection of the state of your vibration and your actions as a reflection of the state of some of the beliefs that you are holding that perhaps you no longer choose to hold so as we have often suggested that you begin to allow yourself to feel your negative and limiting emotions rather than squelching denying them allowing yourself to feel them and asking yourself what a person must believe who would feel this and using those emotions to trace the belief itself nailing it down to decide whether you wish to change it or not you can also do so quite effectively utilizing your action and you will find that you always create what you believe but only because you act that way and when you begin to see which actions you perform perhaps actions that result from a limiting or negative belief you begin again to get an idea that will allow you to take back your power and change that belief for again the only reason you get the effect of that belief is you act that way according to that belief giving you that effect so where we have often suggested that your imagination comes into play as an active tool is once you have acknowledged an old unpreferred limiting belief that you have nailed down according to your emotions and now we are speaking nailed down according to your actions you can phrase the preferred belief and hand over to your imagination allowing your imagination to create a person or an image that already has that belief and allowing your imagination to show you how a person with the new preferred belief would act how they would react or do in any given situation once you create this preferred you model in your imagination you can hand any situation over to it and it will show you what a person who believes this thing that you say you prefer to believe would do in that given situation so therefore if you find that you have an old belief and an old set of actions you acknowledge that then you call forth the new belief and allow your imagination to provide a new set of actions those actions will be vastly different the actions of the new preferred belief will be most obvious and blatantly different from the actions of the old non-preferred belief and you will have right in front of you two different options that obviously will have to have two completely different results therefore you can begin to look at your beliefs and before acting upon perhaps the more limiting beliefs you can create through your imagination the preferred you as a reference and allow yourself to hand over the situation to that preferred you seeing what they do and coming up with an alternate set of actions even going through this seeming process and producing the new set of actions according to the preferred belief will always give you a set of actions that once you allow yourself to see that those actions are an option will be most simple to choose the new actions rather than the old so there is no difficult process involved in changing your beliefs and the results of them for even in giving yourself the benefit of another choice that choice when you allow yourself to see it is so much more shall I say attracted so much more representative of what you would prefer to create that you can head off your old belief devolving into unpreferred action by simply providing the alternative using your imagination as a tool now I remind you that you already create your reality this way you simply do it automatically and with no thought but you always act according to what you believe so we are not asking you to do anything difficult or anything that you need practice that simply are speaking about being more conscious about deciding what you want to believe and deciding what you want to create and then letting all the beliefs that you have bought into unconsciously that may prevent that from happening to come up in the form of emotions but also in the form of actions watch what you do when you are doing something you do not prefer and rather than judging yourself for doing it ask yourself what must I believe to be doing this what must any person believe in this situation to be doing this a belief will be again forthcoming a belief will be presented to you from perhaps you can say or subconscious in one way of thinking of it and it will be completely obvious that well obviously anyone who is doing this must believe this and that belief is now in your control to change for you have acknowledged it I remind you that acknowledgement gives you back the power of choice denial takes the belief that you do not prefer and adds more weight making it more likely that you will act upon it for you are in denial of it rather than acknowledgement all these beliefs exist within you anyway you do not contain a belief and not contain its opposite your ability to even imagine anything shows you that you contain that as well and again I remind you since you are infinite and contain everything there is no outside there is nowhere to put anything put something so you cannot get rid of a belief you do not prefer but you can reemphasize your relationship to a belief that you do not prefer you can make a belief that you do not prefer irrelevant to the actions of your life and therefore that belief will still exist within you but simply not be an expression of the choice consciously or subconsciously to live that belief so therefore all we are suggesting is to begin to watch what you do when you do the things that you prefer in using this particular approach you will find that you do the things that you prefer and be due to positive beliefs that are preferable and non limiting belief but when you watch the things that you do that you no longer prefer without judging them then you can see other things that perhaps you still believe that it may behoove you to acknowledge so you can change that is it clear do you understand the value in a physical world of the action phase that is your ultimate expression in physical reality it is the ultimate manifestation of what you believe and again you can always tell what someone believes someone else even by simply watching what they do in a situation for it is always blatantly obvious that the actions as well as the emotions and thoughts are directly a mirror or directly a window to what you believe so therefore transforming your entire life according to preference is truly quite simple but it is a matter of being mindful and it is a matter of beginning now to choose to perpetuate the behavior that you prefer and to choose to use the behavior that you do not prefer now before we proceed to the interaction simply allow me to say that one of the ways that you lock yourself up from not using the actions that you don't prefer is through what you call self judgment for when you judge those actions well I shouldn't have done that dumb me you do not put yourself in the conducive mental state to glean positivity and glean meaning from it you are far too busy beating yourself up so therefore if you find yourself judging unpreferred actions so what when you judge yourself for judging yourself then you compound the judgment and the judgment becomes what is overwhelmed when you simply acknowledge all right I have judged myself but now I will go a step further and use these actions what must I believe to have done this well perhaps I believe I was helpless in this particular way all right if I felt I was helpless a helpless person would act like this now how would a powerful person act in this same exact situation plug that into your imagination look at how the preferred you in your imagination acts in the same situation look at how they hold themselves look at how their composure remains look at how they deal with other individuals you can use this method in the very simple way to replace the unpreferred actions but not while you are in the process of beating yourself up and knocking yourself down through judgment so therefore judgment slows down the process judgment creates more separation within you and does not reflect acknowledgement and willingness to change the things that you no longer prefer understanding that it is within your power to change anything in your life that you no longer prefer again I remind you that you have so much power as a creator that you can create anything at all and I mean anything that you wish without harming yourself or someone else sometimes trust in timing comes into play when exercising this power but that is truly the extent of your great power it is actually less of a powerful expression a expression of less power to get what you want at the cost of someone else that is technically easier and requires less power but you have so much overwhelming power you actually have the capability of creating the life that you prefer without harming yourself without harming anyone else this is the true degree of the power that you all present to create your own reality allow me now to thank you all for interacting with me in this way for you will understand that within my society this is simply all automatic and we discussed this with you for as you become more like an integrated society which is how we choose to express ourselves that places you have a vibration that is similar to our own similar enough that we can perceive each other for vibration the vibration that you are also determines what you perceive and also determines what you attract and what you can interact with the universe is an infinite statement with many overlapping realities literally in the same space at the same time only separated by difference in frequency difference in vibration and as through your actions you shift your vibration not only do you would change the effect of what occur in your life but you change the effects of what you perceive and you change the effects of which realities are more alike your own and therefore which realities you can now attract were you to twenty to fifty of your years ago explore many of the surrounding galaxies space travel wise you would have found very little life for your vibration as a society was so different from much of this life that you simply would not have perceived each other literally physically but as your vibration as a society and individually shift your perception shift and you are now as a society beginning to see more identification with what you would call extraterrestrial sources for you are perhaps as a pendulum once in a while swinging into the vibration of certain other civilizations and certain other reality this is one of the reasons that some of the extraterrestrial interactions with members of your society will seem to be a bit out of phase with your reality a bit dream like for still are the vibrations somewhat dissimilar they are similar enough to now perceive each other but still dissimilar so that there is still a slight incongruency as you begin to act and live according to preference desire and unconditional love you will find the many expressions within the multiverse to begin to be attracted onto you of same vibration one of them is my society and my civilization but we are not by any means the only one of the things that I am truly thanking you for is that as a society and again individually you have become enough alike of our vibration there is still quite a bit of difference by the way but enough alike for us to have these conversations for us to at least communicate with you in some way in general it will be mental in a case such as this it is mental removed one whereby we utilize within the channel his vocabulary for we do not speak your language and are able because you are of like enough vibration to communicate through this particular medium so to speak thereby again allowing for an interaction and an exchange so we thank you for your willingness individually and society to begin to embody ideas of integration of unconditional love of understanding that we are all one expression many different facets many different explorations within but within one expression one event that you call all that is and you may understand that pretty much any of the society that you will interact with have their own notion of what you call God but it is not a separated notion it is not something out there it is something within and you are all literally viewpoints or eyes if you will of all that is or God itself each one a distinct viewpoint within the one event that is all that is so we express our unconditional love and appreciation to you for your willingness to begin to co-create a third reality that we both can step upon that we both can exist within as your particular orientation comes closer to ours the possibility for face to face interaction becomes more possible but right now there are still many things that you still deny and still refuse to look at within yourself or you feel they can destroy you as I have just shared nothing can destroy you and perhaps the only thing that can even seem to would be an idea that you act upon not simply think it we do not play in that sense that particular game within reality for we no longer in any way deny anything so were we to come physically into your proximity our vibration our bio energetic field what you would perhaps call our aura will express this complete idea this nonbroken energy field when you as the in deny aspects of who you are colloquially speaking as an analogy you create gaps within your own energy field and when you place our field in proximity rather than your frequency perhaps you can say driving our frequency downward a few notches hours tend to elevate yours up a few notches so to speak and therefore the things that you deny and have refused to look at come rushing all at once to the surface which is in general a bit uncomfortable for you this is one of the reasons very often why when individuals interact with us and other to extraterrestrial societies other extraterrestrial societies physically but sometimes even up in a telepathic way they begin to create ideas of intense fear for no apparent reason the fear is not in general of the situation or about the fear is all the things that you deny flooding to the surface all at once from being in physical proximity to again an accelerated bio energetic field so this is one of the physical reasons that we have not to this point interacted face to face with your reality now this has changed quite a bit over the last nine of your years quite a bit and there would be less of this reaction if you wish to call with that were we to meet face to face now then we would have even just one to three of your years ago but there would still be some effect you are seeing within your society through what you call your media the drumming up of many of the societal things that have here to four been denied many of them are negative many of them surround what you call physical mental and so on abuse and things such as that which have remained hidden and are now flooding to the surface in many blatant ways this is a direct sign since your mental mass consciousness is a reflection of your individual consciousness that your society is now ready to begin to look at many of the things that you have here to four denied so the day where we can meet face to face draws closer and nearer it again it's not necessary that we do so but it is more and more likely all the time and you see the signs of it not only in yourself not only in the acceleration of your own explorations but society speaking as well for that I thank you and simply ask you now how I may be of service to you and we may be of service mutually to each other sharing it's nice to be here and have you today I wanted to share something with you about the last intensive interaction that I attended and it goes along with what you were talking about I got in touch with a self-loathing in myself that I never I knew I had but never to be extent congratulations thank you and I had some external external that helped me with that and I just thanked my symbol for helping me shuttle how much I validate myself you sound like you believe oh I know I do very much what I want to share with you was something that you had shared and one of your other interactions which was to feel it to really feel the love loathing and I did that I was frightened the heck out of me well individuals assume that will overcome and destroy what we have shared is that if you are going to create the messenger in that form allow the messenger full audience what did you actually find when doing that for I assume you did not combust for you what you what I do I challenge the feeling I just said come on whatever you give me I'm not going to die you know I'm actually thinking to myself I think and I around that hate to come to the surface and what was the interesting thing that you found that I really loved myself well also that when you allow yourself to feel an emotion it is not an endless infinite idea you actually get to the point where you say all right now it is not something that continues to come when individuals are in denial the belief keeps coming back in the form of an emotion so it seems persistent and it seems constant but when you actually acknowledge it and allow it to deliver the message that it is created to deliver it does not remain constant and persistent for it has a right lived its usefulness in that way so we thank you for your expression and your version of demonstrating what we speak of yes sir after this occurred I've had rain in my ears since last night I was in fact when I was about that evening I had put out the clear intention that any energy that could help me empower myself to speak to me in my dream and that happened I had a woman speak to me through my last ear all night long it seems to me anyway could you tell me who she was well you tell me well I got to have it with a strong but even woman's voice well understand that from that and the energy is quiet undifferentiated so contains both and perhaps that was one of the points to understand the balance of the two where you are both though you engender yourself you become male female physically and your society will not always acknowledge this but contain both energy you both contain female energy and male energy female expression and male expression this is even evident in what you call your hormonal system for though you predominantly will have a hormone that is in that sense definitive of one gender you also have the others and this is a direct physical analogy to the idea that within your consciousness you contain both energy the female being the receptive the female being the intuitive the willingness to inflow and the male simply being the out flow the assertiveness the action orientedness so you're saying that was awesome well as in that sense you were allowing yourself to become more receptive your guide was expressed through the female receptive energy acknowledging that choice then the next day I had a real strong headache and I laid down to to relieve the headache and I as I was late with my eyes I realized I started focusing as I focused in I saw a wonderful space a face of an extraterrestrial with a smile it was so wonderful I got the sense that it was either you or someone of your range what is your sense yes and I asked you to allow you to be obvious in other words when you ask the question you already knew and you need not ask me for validation but simply share with me I saw you and I will say congratulations it was good to see you too I also heard you the next day at one time in that simple you just want to pick up the phone with the ring in my ears I picked it up and you were on the other hand and the ringing seats yeah and what did I say what is your interpretation of what I intended and then well I started to and then I started using the channels name and I said Andrew why are you accusing me I wouldn't believe that it was you I wouldn't believe it was a line why because I don't believe I deserve and group perhaps on some level would not believe he has the ability to communicate with you in that point I fully understand that I didn't and have fully also always share with all members of your society that our stream of consciousness is available you can all tap into it by simply recreating in your heart how interacting with me feels and allowing whatever message accompanies that to come for me so thank you in that sense for sharing our energy in that way thank you thank you thank you thank you sure you know great team as you I was going to ask you about the signature vibrations and let me spend what I'm thinking about the shifting of vibrations and the chemistry different people seem to have and sometimes it's very strong and sometimes you just don't get along with a certain person and sometimes it works with the whole group you just grew away from that group the whole group and you may know with someone some other group is it what it's shifting of your own vibration you meet people that are right for you are well we need people that are in similar exploration that have similar perspective and that the meeting would provide a commonality for mutual exchange again as an analogy and this is quite a physical limiting way to look at it but in one sense it is descriptive if you consider yourself a sphere of consciousness and that in the core of that sphere is your signature portion of your vibration which is unchanging each person's signature vibration ultimately has equal attraction to everyone else's perhaps again as an onion if you were to wrap around that core you're superficial and again this is simply an analogy but your superficial vibration which is the vibration which will change as you change your acting that outer or more layer is the layer that will determine what you physically attract signature wise you are all attracted to each other it is the layers around that core that will seem to filter who you actually wind up having good vibes with social students and what about the chemistry some people just don't have the chemistry and they don't get along and both of them well that is an expression once again as we are sharing of the more superficial outer layer of the vibration that is determined by your action or if you change your actions and then the result of those actions change in no uncertain terms you will attract different individuals and many of the individuals who you attracted through the old actions and vibrations will simply no longer be interested in what you are exploring so it is not the signature vibration that determines that attraction the signature vibration of all beings again perhaps you can say in the ultimate sense are equally attracted it is the superficial the overlaying layer of vibration that is determined and change in all forable mutable through your actions so can you say something how would you handle the situation when other person is actually a nice person and everyone likes him or her but somehow you don't get along with that but how would you handle that situation well it's not something that occurs upon our plan but in extrapolating from your point of view I would simply ask myself in very honest terms what must I believe do not be creating complete unconditional love for this individual what are they doing what are they reflecting to me what about them bothers me for I know that only can it bother me if I match it within my own consciousness on some level so thereby very often those individuals once you are to the point of acting like a complete creator are some of the strongest facilitators and strongest opportunities to flush up some of the more core limiting beliefs now you may find simply after doing so that you have nothing in common with that individual and simply go on your merry way but it will not be an exclusionary idea and you will at least understand what in your belief system provides the effect that you are calling the lack of attraction does that make sense yes thank you for that and two other questions one is I know you everybody on your planet communicates tele-particle is tele-immitically if you did play chess would you be able to play chess if you know what I mean one I then you can control what you want to broadcast and what you don't explain in order to play chess you you have plans you have you have to make plans ahead and if you can read each other's minds you won't be able to play chess hah I understand understand that though we through choice and growth and preference and expansion have the ability in that sense to know the thoughts of someone else or more literally create the same thoughts by being similar to their vibration we also have the ability to explore any gradient of any other idea so we can shield in that sense our thoughts from others or in that sense choose not to receive the thoughts of someone so for a particular intended purpose we could simply assume that orientation and have some fun it is not in general something that we would do however for our games in general will be such whereby both teams will play toward a common goal and everyone wins and last question do you have lines on your farm on your farm not in the way that you mean our skin in that sense is perhaps a bit more pliable in that way and as far as you may receive in certain positions this to be so as far as you know our lines do mean something well that is quite arbitrary there are certain ideas which are extrapolated and bought into but ultimately it is all the product of belief system if someone tells you your lifeline is short you do not believe that you will live a long life it is not that it truly determines it but only to the degree that you buy into and then therefore through expectation and believe act as though that is so and therefore it becomes a self-fulfilling proxy and you will also notice interestingly enough that the lines which are generally considered unchangeable do change change in length change in structure change in character and you know is your planet completely populated by female or male um at the last introduction that I was at I was asking you about my trip to the U.K. and you are suggesting a something along the lines of a poor teacher and I would like to ask more about that specifically were you now before you proceed simply for the purposes of those involved a brief explanation that individual is involved in what you would call setting up tours to what you would call sacred science and is interested in teaching in these tours and had felt the need for some other teachers so we had discussed the possibility of co-teaching do proceed um were you suggesting working with you and Andrew? well there was no particular shall I say focus of the suggestion other than again factoring in since that is one of the main things that we discussed you're excited so whatever expression you are excited about else you that that is your particular focus does that excite? I think it would be fascinating I well that is and no matter who you choose it will. I think it would be so interesting because I really like to discern the the real history and how this buzz about the the real history of humanity and how they developed um their very important expression why they think that they do and and then probably more specifically their their spiritual exploration and so the thought of re um interpreting you know and reclaiming the knowledge for what reason how well what will them do when this knowledge is upon how can you ground any knowledge into the now moment and use it in the now life I think that's a good question. That's the idea is to bring um for example my is the central one of the central ideas is their their place or relationship to the cosmos and that everything is just growing and interactive part of the cosmos and so finding this way to bring that more into our current society and interest in people. You perhaps will understand this on somewhat but the only time that ever exist ever as existed and ever will exist is right now and from any right now moment in that you in any now moment that you express there are an infinite number of probable path and an infinite number of probable futures now many of you can fathom the idea of an infinite number of probable futures for you feel it is not happened yet in the universal sense it is all happening right now including all the past what you sometimes have difficulty with is understanding that there are an infinite number of probable path when you change who you are in the moment when you change your vibration in the way that we have discussed in the moment obviously if it is a shift from the momentum you have been creating you create a different probable future for you have shifted who you are right now but again what is not always completely understood is that you also shift very often just slightly my newly the past as well for it would have taken a slightly different path for you to be the you that you are now that you have changed so what I am sharing is ultimately speaking this and unsettling as this may seem there is no the history for if there were one person experiencing one event then perhaps in one sense they could seem to be a history but because there are many people experiencing one event you call that event an objective event but as each person perceives it it becomes subjective and it can mean a completely different thing sometimes opposite same event to the subjective viewers therefore each one of them will render their idea of what occurred and their idea of what occurred is what occurred for them the person who saw a completely different interpretation it would be inaccurate to say they were wrong it is what occurred for them same seeming event different interpretation both are completely correct from their point of view so when trying to nail down a one discrete objective history you run into shall we say the barrier so to speak that it was in that sense interpreted by many many different subjective individuals so perhaps what it will be prove you to shift your focus toward is finding the history that is representative of who you are and you will find that is all that really matters to you anyway for history will only have the effect on you that you believe it to have if you believe well in history all people were a particular way and you act that way and get that same effect you have used that history to get that same effect if you shift the emphasis you can get a completely different effect in the now and in the future so allow your history to become evident and in expressing that history through your subjective shortness you will attract the other individuals which that history is also the history for in trying to nail down one objective history again you are attempting in that sense to nail down something that is arbitrary and make it definitive does that make sense so that mechanism perhaps will allow you to simply allow yourself to attract the history that enables you to be the most preferred you you can be right now and you need not in that sense in understanding that someone else will have a different history say well you are wrong you can simply interact with the individuals and will generally find yourself attracted to the individuals who share quote unquote share that same quote unquote same history so your job has just become easy do you understand fundamentally what I am saying again it's unsettling to some that there is not one history but again once you have more than one person proceeding it you have different subjective interpretation it reminds me of an incident that happened at one of the sites in the U.S. and called the small one I was there a few years ago with a large group of people myself and another woman were proceeding in this series of rooms they initiated that could take a place there and was quite interesting and beautiful and it evolved the opening of different of our chakras or centers now before you proceed okay to use this to use this as an illustration that is one history one real history not the only one not one that replaces any other one but a valid distinct and true history so proceed there is another guy there who sort of quote God so I think we that means that it wasn't the beautiful center that actually it was a place where there was a great children and were really brutal and ugly soldiers now the history that you are sharing is more in tandem with our particular expression of the history the history that he was sharing was completely the history however again his history and was also again quite relevant to his own life experience in what you call time therefore he will see through the perceptive filter or glasses of his expectations of his understanding of his personal history and technically speaking he is correct as well though again speaking of commonality if we were to say again and this is also arbitrary that there is a the earth that I alone am speaking to you darling on right now our understanding of the co-created history of this particular stream would be more in line with what you have to see if this makes any sense and is translating its own and I think I'm looking around I think it's translating for other people as well the ideas yeah somebody would like to ask something along the way oh and value for the same thing do most it is possible that there is seeing events from different times well yes or from different dimensions or from different universal realities for as you perceive there is one earth that is merely a perception there are an infinite number of earths what you would call parallel lives or earths very similar to your own earth again separated by fine bandwidth of frequency and choice but parallel in that they are similar perhaps again technically speaking where you to walk down the road find a fork and take a right the you that took the left create another branching of a reality all together but the idea is that they all exist in overlap and your perception will be determined by your vibration in the now moment was there something you are specifically seeking no thank you thank you thank you are you true I would like to ask something on the same general topic but it's more when when I was asking the questions of you I was think I was trying to think of what you were telling us about we have choices in any given moment we have a series of choices and we trust in the timing maybe at a certain point in so-called quote time we have five choices maybe it's not the maybe it's not the ultimate or like in my case maybe it's not in this moment I would love to be in Mexico and I would love to be in this here and maybe I don't have money but that right now well if you and if you fit the only way that your abundance could provide that for you did money then perhaps it is accurate in the framework but understand abundance is simply the ability to do what you need to do what you need to do and need not be confined and rigidized to only coming in one form now you can get it in one specific form but the more that that form is not relevant to this moment the more time or space and time that you create from here to there to get there but the more that you are willing to be open and simply attract immediate or more immediate methodology that would simply allow you to do the complete same thing but not be rigidized only accepting it through the means of money the more you actually increase your likelihood of more immediately attracting that and again paradoxically if something is not available in a given moment that you are excited about and you maintain it as a clearer intention but push it out of the way so you can see what is right in front of you see what is right in front of you and choose from those options through your excitement acting on it with integrity even though what in the moment may seem to have nothing to do with going to Mexico it actually does and the doing of that thing and the result from the doing of that thing will lead you to the next thing which again at some point down the line will have died directly up with going to Mexico far sooner than you imagine so it is simply a matter of your definition and your willingness to allow your reality rather than attempt to force and conform it which is not truly the mechanism of creative force and control is the mechanism of feeling helpless that you need in that way to control your reality to feel powerful allowing is the complete allowing of the flow of the power that you already have. How did the trial of thinking come into in order to make these tours there is a lot of planning you have to make a brochure there is advertising once you get the brochures you have to print them and fold them on the ropes etcetera. Now you are simply listing your own beliefs and rules too but do proceed. Well I am trying okay I would like to see that in a maybe a different context I don't think that is very much fun. Are you excited about the folding? Yes or do you assume no one upon your planet is. The point is that there are people who actually like or are excited about the idea of being paid to do so and the point is you get to decide which of the work you will do and which of the work if it does not excite you will put out and attract others to do so in whatever way is available. How do you say that? That is good so it is really how again and how I am looking at it. Well always. Always and always. Thank you for this moment I would like to let that girl go around. Oh girl. But thank yourself for you have done it all and simply allowed me to function as a repuncheon. I thank you for the honor. Shut up. You are. One male male. One male male. I want to ask about the significance or lack of our first name okay as to whether that. No well I mean the significance or lack of significance of your first name. My first name is Cecil. Oh what does that mean to you and what does it mean for finally speaking? Well the nickname that I prefer is Cease and I spell that in order to be simple and straightforward. I spell it C-E-A-S-C. Oh. Now it has been told to me recently that oh gosh Cease means stop Cease and desist. There is a certain negative connotation to the word. Well not necessarily. If you are ceasing shall I say behavior or actions that you no longer prefer it can be quite positive. It simply depends what you are ceasing. What you have ceasing to do is settle for what? Sell yourself out. Assist others at the cost of yourself and again you have enough power to serve everyone at the same time. So simply present it in that way. So ceasing or stopping can be a positive idea if it applies to the right things. It has been suggested well gee why don't you use your middle name John or your initials CJ and maybe the universe would look on you with more favor and maybe other people would be more impressed rather than have a negative name like Cease. Well again it is a neutral name that one particular individual obviously had a negative interpretation of. But only then does that give you the opportunity to agree well yes perhaps my name that I call myself is negative or no no no I am ceasing to sell myself. I am ceasing to do the things which are no longer representative of who I am. You can too. So are you saying that it's my? Do you like the name? Yeah I don't have any problem with it. I did not have to problem with it. I asked you if you watch it. It's a little bit like being a boy named Sue okay and it's a little bit of a challenge and because it had meaning to my parents I've always stuck with the name even though it's not an easy name to live with because it's not a common well accepted name that everybody can spell and pronounce and so forth. But it's never bothered me but it's been brought up for gee why don't you change your name and just something more positive. Oh what do you wish to change it to? I did more representative or in this moment representative of who you choose to be. I don't care if it changes. Oh. Then are you willing then to again plug in or insert a meaning that will serve you. I guess one thing I like about it is that it always requires a little conversation and I enjoy conversation with people even if it's how in the world do you pronounce your name how do you spell it what does it mean where did you get a name like that. Well again now I'm going to have the opportunity to be a bit more metaphysical about and explain what exactly it is that you are now ceasing to do. Okay so therefore still a conversation. It's up to my interpretation since all things are neutral as you told us many times. It's neutral and so I can make it positive or I can feel negative about it if that's my choice. But it's my choice not somebody else's choice and therefore the universe isn't looking on me in disfavor because I've got such a name. Well absolutely. The universe will only mimic how you look at yourself. You will get the effect of how you look at yourself. The universe if you wish to ascribe it again as an outside entity is non-conditional completely non-judgmental. Unconditionally loving what you call God renders no judgment. The God you hear about that renders judgment is the reflection of mankind attitudes within all that is creating God in man and woman image not the other way around. But again or all that is is unconditionally loving has absolutely no condition upon its complete willingness to allow you to be completely who you are and love you for being that you. Where the judgment comes in and again the disfavor to utilize your own terminology is your own self and your own standards. I think probably our culture is such and conditions such that they look upon a name and my particular name generally if you took a vote they would think it's more negative than positive. Well may I ask a question. Are you who you are no matter what or can you be voted out of who you are? Well a rose is a rose I've heard. Well regardless of what I have but that does not answer my question. The question is first of all the vote that you are speaking of from our perception may not exactly be that accurate but your perception that most people would find it negative is one of the is of interest. Well I really don't give a damn how they see as the name negative or positive. I feel okay with it. Oh that is the main point. And again explaining and allowing one who might view it as negative to use it as an opportunity to do it's flame what is positive about it also allows individuals to see that all symbols contain both potentials for positive and for negative interpretation all including that. Great you've helped me a great deal thank you very much. Well thank you for not ceasing to me. I have a question about Samantha Katz how do they experience very interesting things reality and how they experience the people they live with. They experience their reality very much in the now with very little distinction of what has just passed and what is to come. So therefore I am in a room I am walking up steps I am in this room it is not I am in a room I am walking up steps and have just left that room I am in this room I have just left that room and walked up steps and so on and so forth. And simply here I am what's here I am what's here I am what's here car comes along almost hits it runs away down the road and three seconds later is right where it is now with no knowledge that the car almost just hit. What are the people that they live with I mean is there no continuity. Well there is continuity yes there is familiarity but there is the complete sense of willingness to approach an individual in a fresh as if a new mode. You will notice though there may be the perception for individuals do that that they may seem to hold the grudge that it will not last very long and again the grudge is more of a reflection of the person generally holding a grudge on themselves. I generally see them more as I have three cats and they are very affectionate to me. So is that just their general nature and well again it is not that you beat them and they are affectionate to you they are reflective consciousness all animal consciousness is reflections within your own consciousness distinct entities in one point of view but reflections of who you are from your point of view. Can I just one more question. You're not. Declowing how do the other cats view it. I faced with that decision with a kid. The idea is that in general you will find them to quote unquote utilize your own terminology get used to the idea but it will then provide certain limitations in what they are quote unquote generally able to do so it is a decision but understand that they still live happy bonds with no cause. They do not again to continue the idea dwell on it for very long. Is there a way to train them to not destroy furniture so it doesn't have you done. Absolutely. Well I think we being very mindful and perhaps shepherding intervening when they do so very consistently and you will find them to get the idea over time. Also providing again this is quite mundane and colloquial on one level a scratching post or some other idea that allows them to have that natural act without it being at the detriment of something else. Thank you. Well thank you. We do not in that sense have couches or cats in quite the way that you do but we understand the reference at this time we will pause for a short break of approximately 10 to 15 of your minutes of counting and resume contact at that time.
