 This evening of your time as you create time to exist, how are you? Oh, thank you. Allow me to entitle this interaction. You contain it all. Allow me to begin in the following way. We often discuss with you that your personality is comprised, so to speak, and allegorically speaking, of a three-sided prism composed of belief, emotion, and thought. These are, perhaps you can say, gradations or gradient expressions of your consciousness, broken down, separated out to a particular degree that then allows you to express that prism in what you consider to be this physical reality. But understand that perhaps there are, again, allegorically, two other more encompassing aspects of consciousness, prior, if you will, to the belief, emotion, and thought. Fundamentally and foundationally consciousness, the prime source, if you will, begins simply under the category or simply under the orientation of existence itself. And existence simply has the quality, perhaps you would refer to as isness, beingness, it simply is, period, and that is its expression, its totality, it is existential in that way. It simply exists, and it is what you would consider to be all that is. One of the orientations or one of the prime representations of all that is, which, again, is simply existence. It is one thing. It is one expression. Thereby, there are certain, shall I say, explorations within it that necessitate certain extensions or certain enhancements in the overall concept of existence in order to explore from a slightly different point of view. So therefore, the first separation from existence, from isness, is knowingness, which is, perhaps you can say, one time removed from isness, or beingness, or existence. So altogether, you have existence, knowingness, belief, emotion, and thought. Ultimately, then, in your reality, you have action, which midwives these concepts into your reality. But allow us to back up a bit, for the idea is that in its pristine state, in its one state, much as you exist now, even as physical beings, there is not, from that perspective, and again, this is somewhat arbitrary and again metaphorical, but you will understand the point. There is not inherent within the one idea, the ability to self-reflect from seemingly an external source, or there is only one expression, one idea, one statement, and therefore, much as you, as physical beings, would never be able to quote unquote, see yourself without the help of someone else to do so, or what the help of what you colloquially refer to as a reflective surface, a mirror. So also, does that oneness, then, enhance itself with a particular separation? That separation, again, allows the oneness to exist from more than one point of view. Now, at the same time that there is, in the separation, a seaming polarity created, a seaming now, to where there once was one, fundamentally and foundationally, the two are still one, and this is why this is metaphorical, or our allegorical, and we'll only from one particular perspective describe an aspect of reality. It is again quite colloquial, it is again quite rendered down to physical understanding, but again, can some sense be made of this in this way. So once again, from the one complete wholeness, you have a separation, you have now an expansion in a sense of viewpoint, whereby one point of view can now view the other, and the other point of view can then, in a sense, view the first. It creates a dynamic, it creates in that sense an expression that allows the playing out along a continuum. So therefore, all that is, again, from one point of view, separate itself, colloquially speaking, to be able to behold itself from, perhaps you can say, a variety of points of view, where the separation actually occurs as an explosion of many from the one, thereby allowing the one to be reflected not only from one other single point of view, as the aforementioned example, but from all sides, all angles, front, back, side, side, top, bottom, all orientation within what you would consider to be physical space. So therefore, first and foremost, separation of the one primary homogeneous energy of creation results in the ability to once again behold that particular expression from different points of view, from different aspects, thereby giving different access, different understanding, and in that sense, this is what you are as physical beings, for you are one of those distinct and discrete points of view, literally eyes of all that is. So one of the expressions of polarity in and of itself is any separation from all that is. When a separation again is created, it creates a particular relationship to the all that is, and in many ways can also then be reflected or represented as the discrete reality. Your physical reality is seemingly an expression of the separation from the one, and in fact then the product of many other separations, sub separations if you will. Within your particular physical reality, there are the separation of the primary forces that enable the exploration of separation to exist. Now, by definition, one of those forces will be the separative force itself, for that force that will in that sense seem to imply the separation creates the opportunity for the self-reflection and has a discrete and distinct purpose in that way, for it once again allows for the viewing of the self seemingly from external sources, and therefore a well-rounded exploration of the self. Therefore, when we speak of negative and positive polarity, all we truly mean when saying negative polarity is the separative idea, the separative statement, the idea or energy which allows the separation to be maintained and allows the separation to be in that sense perceived by you, which once again is one of the points of the separations we begin with. So therefore, as the negative force would be considered perhaps again separative, the positive expression of that force would be considered into perspective, and it would then be the exploration having played out along the separative point of view, all the different explorations that are possible, all the different and differing distinct points of view that are possible to experience, then the positive in that sense energy will represent the collecting back, the recollection if you will, of the self, though again this is also done on what you call a gradient. So therefore, there is nothing truly bad about negative energy or good about positive energy, they both have a reason for existence, they both are a distinct expression and you contain them both, you contain it all. Therefore, it really makes no sense to deny the negative expression for again that in and of itself is one of the energies that allows the expression of this reality. But again, there are gradations and breakdowns even from this point, and you have seen in no uncertain terms upon your planet that the negative expression, the separative expression can be taken to an extreme to totally deny any of the connection of all things, to totally deny the one that's evolving. And when individuals are truly enmeshed in exploring that degree of separation, often they will feel in that sense, helpless and therefore need to forth and impose upon their external reality, for they do not understand that they are connected to all things within and their only expression, their only ability to express is seemingly externally. So yet, the negative can be taken to an extreme, but the energy in and of itself does not have an inherently bad meaning or navel to it. And in that sense, until if you should decide to, you literally merge back to all that is, you will always be expressing in maintaining any separation, in maintaining any individuality, some aspect of that particular negative energy, again, not meaning bad, but meaning separative for the purposes of exploration. So therefore, it is truly not a matter of running from the negative, the negative has a purpose. And again, as you expand, because you do contain it all, your awareness of both positive and negative expressions and energies increases for that is what expansion is. It expands your awareness of everything that is available in any reality. So therefore, you become more aware of both. However, now you are exploring the positive leg of the expression of this energy and beginning to look at the attitudes and actions that will begin to allow you to once again collect back yourself, if you will, begin now to begin to sense that you are connected to all things, that you are one with all things, and therefore, your orientation, your choice of action may be oriented toward positive ideas, integrative ideas, taking into consideration that everything is all one thing and acting that way with the respect that proves in no uncertain terms that this is what you believe. But this need not mean in any way, shape or form that you need for stake, someone else who may be choosing to still explore negativity. Again, you can validate their experience for obviously, everything that everyone is doing serves them, everything that everyone is doing allows them to explore their reality. But you can simply allow this expanded awareness to include an awareness of negativity, but not an experience of it. The awareness will come in general as we have shared as an awareness of others experiencing negativity, but your ultimate choice to experience either the separate negative or the integrative positive will always be based not on the viewing of the ideas, not on the idea of considering them or diving into exploring them, but ultimately, it is what you act upon. It is what you do that creates the effect. So again, I remind you, if you are simply looking at an idea, if you are simply in that way pondering it, if you are simply exploring ideas within you, they have no power to create themselves into reality. And it is quite safe to look at any idea as positive or negative as you wish, as long as you do not act with it as a foundation. So therefore, when you see someone else exploring negativity, you can in that sense validate their exploration by saying, all right, obviously, this is right for you. Here is what is right for me. I do not choose your reality, and I do not condone it through acting the same way, but I do understand that you have just as much as right as I do to explore what you are exploring. So how fascinating, and then perhaps you will be on your way. But you need not do so by invalidating the negative energy for once again. Acknowledgement allows you access to all things and denial adds more weight, places more attention upon the things that you deny. You cannot deny negative energy for it is simply weaved into the fabric of your reality, and again, by definition, allows the reality to exist. So it is not a matter of in that sense running from it, simply choosing the positive expression and acting according to the positive idea. Now, in the way that you again break down and separate out, this goes a bit further in that each individual in expressing positive and negative energy, and thereby existing as a dynamic, so to speak, between the two, also express another separation that is for the most part, to remain to your physical reality. And it is what you refer to as maleness and femaleness. Now it is not in any way, shape or form that one of these is representative by positive, and one is representative by negative. No, both have a positive interpretation and a positive outcome, and a negative interpretation and a negative outcome. So again, it is not that one is negative, and one is positive. They are both both. And it is not that the gender that you have chosen is the only energy you contain. You contain both energy, though perhaps you express yourself physically in one distinct way, male or female. Now, simply very, very foundationally, the female energy will represent inhalation or receptivity. And in that sense, sometimes can be referred to as intuition or your willingness to tap into and get a accurate sensing of your reality. So therefore, you can do this in a positive way, receiving through positive, shall I say, filter, or you can do it in a negative way and have negative perception. It is not inherently one or the other. But again, you also contain the exhalation, the out breath, the assertiveness, the ability to put out or to act. And that will be represented by the male energy. Also, is this energy described as having a positive orientation, a positive alignment or negative orientation or alignment. So it can be both and it always will be up to you. Your willingness to begin to reconcile within you, your willingness in looking at once again, recollecting yourself will allow you once again to not be in denial of any of these gradations or separations and utilize them fully to your advantage. So therefore, when you are functioning, utilizing through the positive, through the integrative, the female energy, the receptive energy, this takes the form of looking for the positive meaning in your reality, actively searching and seeking and only settling for the positive message delivered. That interpretation, positive interpretation, is in that sense the expression of positive female energy. This also then translates to what you consider to be action, which also then you will always have the choice to act according to separate or negative ideas, helplessness, victimhood, perpetratorhood, or in that sense act according to the positive, which is integrative. Acknowledging is once again gathering and assuming that your reality is part of you and therefore there is nothing to overcome, nothing to conquer. Simply, your willingness to be as all that is in simply exists, be and exist within your reality, allowing yourself to utilize these energies as they serve you. And again, perhaps now you are more oriented towards positive action and positive interpretation. Therefore, the outcome, the results, the manifestation in your life will begin to see more positive. And as again, you do begin to function from the positive perspective, assuming that everything is all connected is all one thing. As you act that way and get the results of that action, your reality, your external reality in no uncertain terms, begins to provide in abundance the evidence that all things are connected. The evidence that you are all one event, one thing. The evidence that think we're inicity, the positive outcome of the interwoven nature of all incidences is now the rule rather than the exception. This is simply part of your chosen path in life now to begin to see. So as you begin to function in this way, not denying the negative, but simply in that sense, shifting your orientation toward the positive and again, allowing the enhanced awareness of negativity to simply come through the explorations of others, to simply come through the awareness of their experience, you still get to experience 100% of the positive and thereby begin to see the evidences of integration. And at the same time, allow the negative energy to be as valid for always will it be. Now inherently as a soul, perhaps you can say, since you refer to yourself in that way, that is simply another gradient or breakdown, but we understand the identification. You are not male or female. You are truly both. And in another sense, neither. That is simply one expression, one gradient, one possibility of how your soul expresses itself throughout the multiverse. It is one of the definitions of the seperative exploration in this particular physical reality. Not all realities have male and female. And in that sense, the realities which do not are simply an integrated whole, which do not even necessarily make the distinction in the way that you would understand it between inflow and outflow. It is simply one entire breath with no distinction of separating down the inhalation from the exhalation. But in your reality, you still do. And you may understand that even as again, using your breath as an example, you do receive or breathe in and put out or act and breathe out. This is truly two expressions, but of one idea. And you contain it all by definition. Only can you perceive anything if you first contain it, otherwise it would make no sense to you. So all the energies and all the seperative explorations that we are disrupting you contain. So therefore, you cannot run from them. There is nowhere to go. They are who you are. And they are within you. It is simply a matter now in the awakening age of transformation upon your planet of your ability to choose and exercising this ability to not only choose where you always have chosen anyway, whether it was unconsciously or not. But now the exploration is choosing consciously according to preference. And when you factor in your preference, maintaining your integrity, you are truly honoring who you are to the highest degree, for you are saying to the universe that my preference is who I am. That's why I prefer it. That's why something excites me. And when you no longer deny this aspect of your preference, you honor the universe. You in that sense, return perhaps again, colloquially speaking, the favor of your existence by being willing to be who you are most fully and function within the parameters, the polarities, the separations that you have laid down, not in denial of them. Again, denying any of these energies makes that energy more, shall I say, likely for you to choose by giving it excess attention, rather than the acknowledgement which equalizes all things and simply puts the choices in front of you and allows you to choose with no strings attached. So therefore, there is nothing bad about negativity. It is simply an exploration. All that is being unconditionally loving completely, obviously thinks it, for it places no limitations upon your ability to express and explore negativity. If all that is thought that negativity in that sense was worse than positivity, it perhaps would not even be an available exploration. It is considered an equal and valid exploration by all that is. And since again, all that is is everything and is unconditionally self loving, all that is does not validate, invalidate any portion of itself. All that is never will. Therefore, you will have the choice to invalidate yourself, but all that is will not join in with you in doing it. All that is unconditionally loves you, no matter what, unconditionally trusts whatever it is you choose to explore and understands the complete equality of every aspect and every nuance within reality. As you accept this similar sense of unconditionally, you will find perhaps that you have preferences. You may find that your preference is of positivity, but you need not invalidate the exploration of those who are exploring negativity, or you have explored it for many thousands of lives, many tens of thousands of years upon this planet alone. And so they too have such the right. And as you are unconditionally lovingly granted that right, so can you also grant that right to someone else. Now this does not mean that you will interact with scores of people who choose negativity. In general, you will begin to attract interactions with them less and less. And again, their experience of negativity eventually will only be in the subtle form of an awareness from some remote means of their negativity. Since you will not be interacting with it, negativity because you will be choosing positivity. In general, you will not interact with individuals choosing negativity. But again, by validating their reality, that makes this more so than invalidating it, which draws that to you, or you have obviously not reconciled it within you if you do not validate it in someone else. And you may simply understand that your exploration, your timing is such where you now choose positivity. In doing so, you automatically change the face of your life. In doing so though, you also provide a service to everyone else. For they then see as a living example that it is possible that the positive, integrative point of view is actually workable. Believe me, when I tell you that there are many individuals upon your planet who do not believe that it is actually workable. And most of them will come from a perspective you sometimes refer to as original sin. Well, man is inherently bad. Man inherently chooses negativity. This is not our perspective. This is opposite of our own understanding. Our own understanding is because you are each sparks of the infinite creation of all that is itself by extension, by extension of the fact that all that is is the grace of the universe you are born in original grace. And therefore, if you wish to talk about momentum, if you wish to talk about tendency, this is your natural state. This is far more natural a state for you to choose. It is the state of all that is. You are a reflection of all that is. When you speak about all that is judging and a vengeful God or all that is, you are literally creating God in the image of man. Man who chooses negativity or woman who chooses negativity. But truly, if you will, but in your heart of hearts and your mind of mind ponder the idea that all that is is unconditionally loving, then that cannot coexist with the idea of judgment and vengeance. That is shall I say a man woman made creation for the purposes of this explanation. Therefore, you can begin to explore that same unconditioned algorithm both with yourself but also with others. With others, again, it can come in the form of validating their exploration, even if it is not one that you choose. But within yourself, it can also come in the form of that same validation. For from time to time, you may in your now choosing to be a positive being, still explore shall I say, accept to the left or step to the right of negative action, thereby getting a particular result. But when you are willing in getting that result to employ the positive female energy, you will interpret that result from how it has served you from the positive perspective, the interpretation, the reception can be positive. And then should you choose to express the male energy, the active ingredient with that positive orientation, even from having performed a negative action, God in a seeming negative outcome, you can glean a positive meaning from that negative outcome, perform a positive action and ultimately get a positive result in every single thing. Because you contain it all, you also contain the ability to express it in positive terms across the board. And you also contain the ability to once again, perhaps once in a while, still express some negativity and still continue to grow. Still continue to integrate in a positive way. Again, not by judging yourself for the negative act, but by seeing what you have learned from it and incorporating the lesson and acting anew. Now, one of the vehicles for separation, one of the ideas or expressions of the negative energy is what you call judgment itself. For judgment in that way, separate things out and places unequal weight or value upon them. And therefore, when you judge yourself, you in that way separate yourself out and apply a lesser value to yourself, which is an expression and a reinforcement of separation, separation of perhaps from an exalted source, a lesser being. So judgment is one of the mechanisms that allows the continuance of negative energy, allows the continuance of the receptive negative energy, negative interpretation, and then thereby also negative action. So where you find yourself judging, here is your primary opportunity to transform your life to the greatest degree possible by simply reminding yourself one moment I am creating a separation. I unconditionally love myself, and therefore, perhaps I have done something that I do not wish to continue to do, but I will understand that it is all right. I cannot change it until I first accept that it is all right that I have done it and that I can learn from it. And when you glean the lesson from it and then move on with that lesson, you have actually balanced, so to speak, that negative energy. So whereby judgment is the mechanism for separation and continued separation, both of others and of yourself as well, unconditional love and acceptance is the mechanism for integration and reverses the momentum of the separate and judgment. You can in that sense pardon, if you will yourself, in any given moment by simply transforming your judgment into unconditional love and moving forward with the very same respect afforded to yourself that all that is can only afford to you, for again, all that is is always unconditionally lovely. So therefore, you always have a model to follow. You always have a temper. You always, because all that is, loves you conditionally, always constantly, you always have the ability to drum up and feel that vibration. It is eternal, and therefore, you can always once feeling it match that vibration. And that vibration is, again, just as judgment is the mechanism for separation and continued perception of separation, unconditional love is the mechanism for complete integration. So therefore, you are not in any way in your exploration running from negativity toward positivity. Simply you have explored negativity to its end degree and are now beginning to express the joyful, perhaps you can say on one hand, alternative of gathering yourself back together. Again, as you do this and your actions, your positive actions have results, the face of your life changes. The evidence comes forth. The evidence that everything is connected comes forth. The evidence that you can create according to preference comes forth. The evidence that the fulfillment of your excitement with integrity can only yield more excitement, more options, new opportunities, new resources, new knowledge is forthcoming, but only upon your willingness to put that out and therefore get that reflection back within the polarity of positive and negative, which allows for these reflections. Therefore, you do contain it all everything. And it is not a matter of denying anything that you contain. That gives more weight, acknowledging that you contain it all takes off the pressure for it simply then becomes a method of again, not watching every step because something can get you, but simply choosing because you contain it all anyway and you get to choose from what you create. And yes, you can choose unconsciously as many of you have been brought up to do, but also can you now choose consciously. And this is also one of the evidence reflections of your new willingness to begin to explore the positive, integrative energy. You now have the conscious choice. Congratulations. Allow me now to thank you for your willingness to allow us to also express our degree of polarity for being physical, being such as yourself. There must be some expression of what you would consider to be the negative energy again with no good or bad connotation, but simply in the ability for us to separate to the degree where we can perceive ourselves. And as we do from our perspective, revel in our individuality, but it is not a disconnected individuality. There is far more through action and choice, the expression of the positive, which automatically reinforces the connected net, which you can never lose. Only can you create a seeming loss of the perception of it, but never can you lose the connection. Never can you be this connected. Never do you truly have to get back to God or all that is. Simply realize that you are the eyes of God or all that is and simply cannot in that sense be anything else. And whereby your own two eyes gives you a unique perspective, gives more depth to the reality. So do the many billions of eyes upon your planet give depth perception to all that area. So therefore you are literally the eyes of creation. We thank you for functioning in this way. We thank you for co-creating this reality together with us this evening of your time. And we now ask you how we may be of service to Sherry. Hey, where in the opposite energies of male, not opposite, of female and male, does the sexual union come? Would that be the third side of the triangle or are we totally whole without ever having had a sexual union with an opposite partner during our lifetime? Well, ultimately, most foundationally, it is both. You are already complete and need not have something external to prove that complete. However, very often in the understanding of that completeness, one of the expressions of that completeness can be that type of union, which in and of itself does imply the overall oneness, doesn't fly the overall merging, does allow you to see from both points of view, simultaneous. Does that answer the question? Yes. So as people who have never been married or anything and have never had a sexual union with a partner or whatever, they still are growing and expanding in their negative and positive clarity. Oh, absolutely. And no matter what their particular preference or orientation winds up being physically, this is always you will find again that the sexual act is an expression of the integration of those energies. Oh, thank you. Sherry. Hey. I wanted to share two things. Oh, number one. Number one. I chose the positive to do my mail side to act. And I wrote the letter to the foundation. I needed the money to go to school in Italy. And I needed $10,000 and then I got 11,000. Wow. That was very fast. I, as we have discussed, this is the rate of all of your acceleration and your willingness to put out always brings the perfect reflection back again, whether that had been zero or 11. But in your particular instance, what this demonstrates and can be of use to all others involved is simply when you do something, when you take the steps, when you make the choice, when you get off the fence, you cannot help but get a reflection and result that is a 100% appropriate reflection. So therefore, many times it is the indecision. It is the paralysis that seemingly is accompanied by what you call the frustration. Once you then again act, then again get involved. Even if you quote unquote make the unpreferred decision, the reality is moving along and the results of that decision will make themselves evident and lead you to the correct and more appropriate preferential decision. But in your case, you went, I remember two. Number two, as I said, I was on television on the on the talk show. And I didn't know exactly what result that was going to have. What was happening is that I'm going to be speaking to a person about doing a weekly help new ways show came off a bit better than you thought. Yes, did I watch it? It was okay, except for my hair. Oh, well, just imagine how many you'll attract with a new hand. So, we're going to talk about doing a weekly show and interviewing different healers and herbalists and doctors and channels and just to go from Greenwich to Westport. I think that's going to happen. Well, congratulations. You are now yet another eye of creation. So all these good things are happening where things I consider positive and then there's another thing that I want to interpret it as positive and I'm not in the moment I'm actually changing the positive. But it has to do and I'm going to talk about something personal, which isn't very much. Perhaps this is number three. I had to do with that man that I'm going to go to the land to the sea. And we seem to be having communication problems here. Well, perfect communication perhaps, simply not as you expected. You used to call me Thursday night with this new phone number and it's Saturday and I haven't received a call yet. I'm not sure it brings up a lot of being. I'm not sure. But now I don't change. I feel the positivity in me that I don't have to interpret as negative. Well, are you trusting the timing or are you assuming it can only come at a particular time and if it is not at that time, you've lost your opportunity. I'm assuming that. I'm assuming that it means all kinds of other things. What will you do? Now that you are speaking of the positive interpretations, what positive corresponding action can you then take? My answer? Now, I did say positive. I can't believe it. You're an action. Well, I tried that wasn't positive. Well, that isn't a lineman. No, that wasn't a lineman. I mean, there's a lot of old beliefs that I had about this. And it struck me that the fact that it's old belief I have that man who needs to leave. Well, some do. So, do someone. What is the point? The point is you will attract individuals who leave individuals who do not leave. Who are you? What are you representative of? When you make that statement, then you begin to look for the similarities in others, not allow yourself to be defined by the differences, thereby then attracting those similarities. So, allow this as an opportunity to reassert who you are and how you interact with others, which is not to leave. And then I therefore assume that your positive action will be in that vein. Right. So, yeah, that is my intention. So, then my intention would also be is when I do speak to him is to say, exactly how I feel. Well, perhaps that is a good idea in terms of making a clear communication. We thank you. I would also like to send a message to the Shah to thank him for talking to you. Perhaps it was not his entire head, but I understand. I've been exploring a lot of positive things and it's just great. Oh, not you too? Yeah. There's something going around. You guys have a lot to do with it. Well, not really. Though, perhaps we will share and revel in quickly. But ultimately, you make the decisions, you take the actions and we do none of that. Simply reflect in the process, perhaps alternatives. But ultimately, you choose them. And that is why you get entire credit. But thank you. Well, I'm aware of negativity in people I know, but in my life, I think it's been happening that are just wonderful. And there was something I wanted to do and I started to do it. And then something came in the mail that changed the direction to a better one. And everything that money I have saved is just the right amount and equipment I need. I haven't, but we had bought and never taken out of the box. And it's just like looking at the notice. And it's so exciting. I just love it. And also, I played in the penance tournament recently. It did very well. And I know it was directly because of using the concept you share. I mean, I was using them. Well, did you have fun? Yes. But usually I'm a ranking attorney. Well, you can no longer say that now. One of the main things that helped was to start out by understanding that what I was feeling was not here and our business was expanding. Communication with my higher self. Therefore, I was scoring the advantage. Oh, and it always. Yeah. I had to do it over and over for each match. And they kept working and all the other things worked too. I didn't know where to go. Now, as we guarantee that this will work, we also guarantee that only you can prove it. So we thank you. Before you proceed, your friend with what you call the dis-e-what occurred then. She's been saying it through order. So I haven't been able to interact with her. Oh. But she is not doing well. Were you able to share the information? Is there some way that you count? Okay. I'm the same. Can you do so through your name? Oh, I want to. Well, I'm still planning to make this. It was not extraneous that the question was asked and answered. And we would simply suggest that some point since you went through the lights anyway that you shared the answer with. Oh, I actually intend to. I made a copy of that session. And I thought about it and I, and she is going to get back to me when she's able to do it and how we will get together. What will happen? Oh. Did we follow? Also, I did have one question. What happens? It is possible though in that sense generally. In other words, it things out again in your sleeping dream reality in lieu of doing so in your waking dream reality, you still get the full opportunity to fully express and experience it, but then do not bring back the quote unquote time lag consequences of it into this again, seemingly for now separated reality also again separated by poleography, by understanding, by mere shifts in your orientation that allow you to perceive the two as separate, but for now you do, you create them in that way, and you allow yourself a certain advantage in being able to explore in this reality seemingly without reaching certain agreements in this waking dream. I find that on my dream state and my night dream state, when I wake up, well, this is the world that's happening. I really want to find doing something that I could do anymore, and I'll think about what it is I'm doing, and use your concepts to understand our concepts, to understand why I'm doing it, and what I prefer to do, and then I'll wake up and I've gone through this whole thing. And again, still though, do you afford yourself the ability to explore perhaps a negative choice, a negative action, get a negative result, have it have a particular corresponding result to yourself and your understanding, and then wake up and so to speak, get to start all again. There's only one of the many, many ways that that reality can serve. Now you can also within that reality create positive physical effect as well. Those will tend because they are positive, integrative experiences to be added onto you and to some degree the experience in this reality, where the negative ones may seem to stay separate. Or again, negative is a separate dimension. One nice time I can have a bowl of stuff. Well again, you contain it all. Yeah, there is not an error in the video. There is one type. Like, you had to do it. Shut it. Hey, stay mad. Thank you. Hello again. Three things for the first time. Right. I did take action on the topic we were talking about and found that man, a therapist most probably, and it feels like a great release. So again, it was the experience of taking action, getting off the fence, being, you know, indecisive and the relief of that. So I want to, I just wanted to share that with you. Now many of the things that you created the paralysis for, the what if this happens, the what if that happens, simply become irrelevant when you actually perform the action. They are what if scenarios, not what is and what is in the moment, what if is using that moment to project from away from, so to speak, that moment. So therefore again, the actions always reground you and even again, should you make what you later consider to be perhaps a non-prepared choice, the taking of that action, the making of that choice, the results of those actions, and then the feedback that you get, the receptive you will allow will then reorient you. So literally you cannot truly make a mistake. They are always full takes of your reality. Regarding the visualization that we did, or the channeling, where just to share with the group, you had me visualize a white column of light and you magnifying glass next to, next to it on a table and under the light was the book of my life. And to try, not to try, to uncover what the answer to my question, you know, and I feel that the reason that I don't want to know is because I want to be surprised. That is one of the reasons we often will not share information with you. You have in that sense created much of this reality for the unfoldment itself, for the joy of the discovery itself. If you are not positive, the oriented joy is generally not the first thing you think of. But when you begin to entertain the positive energy and notion and orientation, it is all joy. It is all exploration and discovery. And again, that is what is unique and actually useful about forgetting 99.999% of everything you ever knew, everything you ever were, to become a soul in a given life. It is not a curse. It is not a casting out of the garden by any means. It is simply in exercising that forgetfulness, the only way that you can seemingly discover. I remind you once again in your pristine state, you are all knowing beings. So when you are all knowing when everything is obvious and evident, there is no such thing as learning. There is no such thing as discovery. And there definitely is no such thing as surprise. For nothing can ever creep up behind you. You have 360 degree peripheral vision, so to speak. So one of the part and parcel reasons for this very reality, everything else aside, is simply for the joy of this discovery and unfold. So is it that we, I sort of felt that you were trying to assist me in acknowledging that I know exactly what is going to happen? No, I was not trying to do it. I won't providing a reflection which then provided the opportunity for you if you wish to match that reflection to a sister. I guess my question is, is I guess it is the choice whether I want to know or I want to be surprised. We are all capable of knowing exactly what is going to unfold in our lives. But I am not, I am like exploring which. From one point of view, the joy of discovery would seem to remove the capability to know if you wish to in all cases. So perhaps how this can break down in practical use is if you do know, then you needed to know. If you do not, you are exploring the surprise and joy of discovery. The trust in this then lets you flow with that and then it in that sense manifests most quickly. The resistance and judgment of it prolongs the time. I was thinking that I was denying, I was denying my knowing, covering, I was putting a curtain over my knowing. And I just don't know where that, you know, with a line is with that. Well now that you have the joy of the discovery, who can't? All right, one more question. That was a very difficult during the time interaction with you for me because I wasn't getting to what I was trying to get to at the moment. Now Andrew told me afterwards that the body hurt for the whole rest of the day. Was that because of our interaction? Yes, but only on a subtle level. The idea is again, it is representative not of the specifics of the interaction, but of the degree to which she again, only being strictly aware of the specific, is still taking responsibility for someone else. For now that explanation will push the buttons. Oh, thank you. feedback over there. Oh, I was in your line. I was in the time before when Dan and Daniel was channel and he was thinking about looking for symbols. And I have found some symbols I'd like to add. Oh, do you see? In my meditation over the last month, a month ago I had been out here daily for a symbol from my guidance, a personal symbol for me. And I was driving home from work in my car. Do you mean in addition to the already supplied symbol of the grant? Oh, proceed. Thank you for remembering. And I was driving home in my car and I looked up in the sky and there was a 50 foot violet, ikilata, china. 40 foot, the goa. And I knew it immediately that it was for me. And I don't really, I don't, I didn't get it in my mind, but I was going to be shed some light on. Well, first of all, you completely got it. You saw it. So therefore, second of all, that symbol is again a direct representation of one of our particular styles of physical, what you call space crime. So therefore, it was in a sense, a tap on the shoulder. And I felt many taps. Another thing was that a week ago on Sunday, we had a heavy snowstorm in this area and I was walking my dogs in the field and three times the sky opened up to completely blue sky and covered up in white and snow and opened up close, open, close, open room. And I knew I was the only one just to treat it. And it just amused me because I, my feeling about it was that the same, it was the same communication. It was from the same source. Well, in one way, in another way, it was from your own source. But the idea is that it will represent your willingness to begin to open up literally to the other realm, which other individuals may or may not match you and see at the same time, but are no less real and valid for you. I have been aware that I'm opening very much to other dimensions. May I ask you a question? What will you do about how will you ground this information into a practical and usable format for your reality? For though the mental plane exists within your reality, it is the action plane that we need. So how is this of use to you? And perhaps you can begin to look at many of the inspirations that you are getting in terms of how you can then exhale them, breathe them out, add them onto, ground them to your physical way out. Allow this to stand in awareness to improve the awareness of the education. And if the answer is, I don't know, that is just fine, but the point is to now draw your attention toward the grounding, toward the practicality, toward the accessibility. This is what is of physical service to you and then also provides reflections to others as well. The only idea that I have about this now is to acknowledge the awareness when I see it happen. And also allow that acknowledgement to come in the form of a universe understanding and amusing, a muse, if you... I was too many of the muse at my triangle in my guide and I had a very amusing symbol just Friday morning. I was driving to work and I was behind a car that had a license plate, seven dwarf. And I followed it the whole time because it used me so that someone would choose that as their license plate. And then I went to my classroom and I opened the door and when my little students said to me, the first thing I heard, I have the seven dwarf. To some degree that will simply draw your attention to what you call the number seven and it's many significance. The seven levels of reality and many other expressions that are more shall I say, your main to what you are about to explore. Or now I will leave at that point. One other question. I've also been aware that I'm traveling when I'm sleeping. And you all are by the way, but do trust me. The great work is being done on my head and in my energy field when I'm sleeping. And what I'm experiencing is a few seconds prior to waking up. There seems to be a lot of discussion. Well, sometimes this can literally be said. Depending upon the level of your consciousness that this discussion takes place on, you may or may not bring it back as a distinct memory. Understand when you in that sense express what you call your nighttime dream reality, you are tapping into more of the totality that you generally again in coming to this reality and choosing the exploration choose to forget. Now the aspects when tapping into your totality that have some commonality to your reality will seem to come back as some type of translatable experience. But the others that do not, the aspects of yourself, so unwiked physical reality that there's nothing to compare them to are just as busy. Do have you being just as involved and experiential, however, will generally come back so to speak in the form of and many of you have experiences knowing that you have been busy with no sense of what you have been doing. So when in that sense you wake up from your quote unquote sleeping dream with this feeling in general, there are exceptions, but in general that is representative of non physical experience that again at least in translating it on a one to one basis will not have enough commonality in this reality to have a translation. However, the information that is useful in this reality will wind up coming out subtly and automatically in the form of your actions in the shall I say preceding days after that. So therefore the advantage is automatic, the advantage unfolds with perfect time and no amount of analytical reasoning will allow you to grab whole of these ideas for they literally are elusive of analysis. They literally exist separate from the ability to be analyzed. So how you realize these experiences most fully is by ceasing to analyze them and simply go ahead with the light and then again they come out in subtle ways where they can actually apply to the reality hence again the grounding. But actually what I'm experiencing is what I'm remembering the second that the seconds that are upon awakening I'm shocked that my body is lying down and I'm shocked at the position that I'm lying in. Why? Because I don't expect to be there. Well now you are seeing the degree to which when you create one distinct reality it may in that sense seem again through the negative energy and completely separate from this reality and you are feeling that dichotomy you are expressing that particular separate new nuance of the negative energy which again is part of who you are and part of the service in allowing you to remain and maintain a physical experience. Do you have any suggestions for the ground? Do whatever excites you the most in any given moment from what the valence of that is the most accelerated way to realize everything I have ever discussed in a sense is simply the icing on the cake of your excitement. Thank you. Oh thank you. Hey. Good day there. How my planet is wonderful in the position of my geosynchronous orbit. Well that means that I am orbiting in synchronization with the orbit of my planet so therefore experience what you would call day and night the same as the portion of my planet that I am quote unquote presently over so to speak. Are you going to experience the sunset in this session? No. I think they continue I think it's a lot. Just as you. I do not plan my day in that way though I do think we're going to think we find myself beholding that quite well. Yeah. What's the big up where Susan was I had an experience last night too and some of the questions were answered and her. For sharing and but I had an experience of when I awoke I couldn't really feel my body this is in the middle and I woke up and I couldn't really I could feel my hand touching my body but I couldn't my body couldn't feel my hand. That is because you were still in that sense expressing what you sometimes refer to as the astral presentation of the body which will feel distinct from the body. Okay well the question is that I did what you suggested which was July supine and you know concentrate on my third eye. I heard the humming and the. No I did not say concentrate as much as create an awareness it is not an active effort it is an allowance and simply a straying of the attention with no effort. Do you feel. No that's interesting comment because I do have trouble when you exert the effort. It is simply a gentle swaying of your attention nothing intense. Turning your eyes up into that area. It is a focusing of your consciousness not your eye balls. So I was traveling I knew that and I ended up falling asleep in the presentation so I don't know what happened. This is quite common. It is generally again an extended version of the experience again extending into generally non-physical portions with no translation. And I know I was very aware of one part of the dream but another part of the dream was very busy and I was very busy with you and others and traveling on that level and I'd like to invite you to give me any information about that because I don't remember it but I don't see why you can't share with me. All right we had a good time. That is the bottom line for us anyway. We only interact having a good time colloquially speaking in all that we do so therefore when interacting with us when co-creating a interaction with us at the same time you too experience that degree of joy that degree of complete willingness to express who you are spontaneously automatically and thereby again reap the benefits of the manifestations of those actions. Because every night before one of these interactions the night before I have a lot of visits and a lot of experiences. I don't know if that's my consciously I know that you know it's kind of a celebration because the next night I will be here speaking with you and I'm wondering what this means to me in short. Well only you know that I can tell you what something means to you. What use is my travel to go see you and others. What use and what benefit do you derive from? I assume it adds to the richness of your experience which allows you to express the joy in your mind. Yeah yeah different joy. One thing I will share is that as we shall I say have often been doing lately with certain individuals we did take a swim together in the waters of economic. And many will find yourself swimming in such a pristine body of water. You will generally perceive it as perhaps a lake or a pond many times opening out to the open sea but not always. That brings up a lot. That is why I said. You could just not have memory it's like an incredible sea. Well it's quite credible I assume otherwise it would disappear. Quickly I'd like to ask this comment about this negative ball area. Perhaps not that quick. Okay I listened to the intro and it was great. It was a repeat of my private session with you. Well not from my perspective but whatever you wish to. It was very familiar and great. But not a repeat perhaps a reinforcement. Exactly and that's exactly what I took it at. That I really need to grasp hold of this idea about my negatives and positive qualities. Well you may wish to. And I was looking for a vidact except that this week now that after our session it's been a long time ago. The ball has been rolling as a negativity as far as. Allow me to share this with you and come through much of it. And this again applies to all of you as well. When accelerating your awareness and choosing positivity. Like vibration attracts like vibration. And vibration is not valid. Therefore when you steep yourself in positivity the negativity that you have perhaps bought into up till now will separate out by definition. How it does so is to come to your retention. When it comes to your retention if you acknowledge it as we have shared and choose the alternative you transform it. Therefore when you choose positive and act positively the things which are still negatively remnant will come to the surface. They must they repel from the positive choice. They make themselves available to you very often in the form of what you call negative emotion. How you most appropriately and efficiently will process it is first of all by allowing yourself in the creation of the timing of that moment to feel that feeling to the fullest extent that you can. If it is misery you are perfect creators make it perfect misery. Dive into it. Challenge yourself to feel it even more. Well I can be even more miserable. I can be even more frightened. I can be even more judgmental. Feel it. Be it. Exude it. Then it will deliver its message. Resulting always in a window to a belief. Emotions do not exist in a vacuum. They are always directly only a result of a belief. You can say I just feel this but that is a denial. You can say what must I believe to feel this but you first must feel it. The feeling is distinct. It activates within you. It allows for the complete separation so to speak of that negativity from your homogenous positive new perspective. So first of all when you feel these things rely on yourself. Feel it. Drum it up. Dive into it. Create it. Imbue it. Then ask yourself the standard question. What must I believe to be feeling this? What must anybody believe to be feeling this type of thing? Allow the belief to come forth. Embrace the belief. Especially if it is a belief you do not prefer or you can only change it if you acknowledge it. Then and do not stop at this point. You may create a great despair if you do. Then provide the alternative. Having acknowledged the unpreferred belief. The alternative will now have as much weight with the acknowledgement of the unpreferred belief. If you squelch the emotion you deny the belief. If you then feel the emotion but do not glean the belief you deny the belief. If you feel the emotion and do not stop being honest with yourself till the belief is delivered you own it. Perhaps in one sense of this word you win. Then you get to choose the positivity but not out of denial of the negativity. Denial remember gives the negativity more weight and puts it back into the pot so we speak. So therefore from this point forward embrace the negativity. Allow it to deliver its message. Pat it on the back. Send it on its way in preference of the new positive alternative. A very simple review and we thank you for the opportunity to win. Oh what? For now that will do. At this time we will pause for a short break. To be determined the length of by you I assume and will then resume contact at that time.
