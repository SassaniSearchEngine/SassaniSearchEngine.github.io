 All right, I'll say before we continue, allow me to share this with you. We sometimes speak of the fact that we do interact with other societies other than your own. Earlier I mentioned that your degree of focus of consciousness as a society was rather unique and also mentioned that many other societies out there do create less of a separation, less of a focus. And this will take various physical forms since all physical is a reflection of consciousness. For instance, in your particular society, believing that you exist within a reality as in separate elements or separate expressions in an external reality, you will assume that you do not have everything you need on your own. And one of the physical reflections byproducts of this is what you call physical eating. The need to take in sustenance from the environment in such a way where you could not live without it. And then you digest, absorb, and then as you say, excrete a byproduct, which is far different from the initial intake material. This is a reflection and expression of what you sometimes refer to as sustenance. As you begin to expand your awareness, as you begin to express yourself as being more connected to your environment being an aspect or your environment being an aspect within you, what you call physical eating will change its form. Eventually, you will seem to exchange energy or sustenance or very literally forms of light with your very environment itself without needing to intake something and digest it and change its form. Or in particular society, although we did eat in much the same way that you do initially, no longer needs to eat. We sometimes do eat, we still have a mouth, we still have what you call a rudimentary system of absorption. But it is largely symbolic. Perhaps you can say in many ways, we eat for the fun of this. We exchange or absorb, perhaps you can say, energy with our environment directly, but even this is understood to be occurring within us. The environment that we exchange with is still understood to be part of us and not separate from us. Our particular society, as your society transforms into a limited point of view, are beginning to simultaneously transform into being non-physical. When you expand your awareness to a certain point, you literally no longer express yourself in what you call embodiment or in a body or as a body. Or you are not literally within your body. Anyway, your body is within your consciousness. On a gradient, there are other forms that society that express themselves as more an integral part of or expression of their reality will express in terms of how they, perhaps you can say, eat, and I will provide one example. There is a society that we are aware of. They are largely perhaps what you would refer to as telepathic, although even that is a misnomer for they do not think in the way that you think. They are humanicoid, meaning they have a head to arms to legs, but their system is more akin to what you call the plant life upon your planet. I will be very loose in the terminology. This is not a direct comparison. It is an analogy, but perhaps you may say that they function more on the basis of photosynthesis than actual absorption, digestion, and excretion. They have a very interesting way of exchanging energy with their environment that we find most fascinating. Their method of photosynthetic absorption, and again, I am using this as an analogy. It is not quite the same as the plant photosynthesis upon your planet. It is, fascinatingly enough, internal. In other words, they do not absorb light through their skin to convert and reassign the values of energy that they then, quote, unquote, expend as physical beings. They have what you would call a very rudimentary, a very basic system of absorption, but it is not a system of digestion. They do not literally need to take in anything and change its form in order to express their understanding of exchange with their environment. How they, quote, unquote, and I am using the term loosely, each is as follows. They have what you would call very smooth, crystalline-like rock substance. They lay them out on perhaps what you would call a table. It is not an exact analogy. And allow them to absorb what you would call the starlight or sunlight of an arm, their planet, over what you would call a period of one of their days' time. These particular crystalline structures then absorb what you call the sunlight aspect of it and begin to, as you say, glow or radiate. The beings then ingest these crystalline rock-like structures. Their skin is, shall I say, opaque but still somewhat transparent. So when they place the structure in what you would call their mouth, you can see the emanating, the glowing, through what you would perhaps, loosely refer to as their chief structural. As the crystal passes through their rudimentary system of absorption, you can watch that glowing crystal as it moves down slowly through their system. Though what you will notice is that as it does, it glows less and less. They quote unquote, and this is not the way they represented, but it is the way you would seem to understand it, absorb the light that they unquote stored within the crystalline structure. They then, shall I say, evacuate the stone in its original form, put them back on the table and go about their business. And this is one particular differing kind of form, where they do not feel the need to take something in, transform it, and have the sustenance provided. They in a very natural state understand that everything is just in exchange of energy and utilize that symbol to express it. There are many different forms of this throughout the multiverse in the many different societies, but this is one that we had not mentioned before and thought that you might, perhaps you do not, but might find it fascinating. Therefore, they have their own way of getting their rock song. All right, third density humor is not my strong form. I thank you for indulging me. Do understand, however, that what I am saying is a true expression. There is such a race. Perhaps one day you will become aware of them. Do not try to water them. All right. I thank you once again and say shitting. Beyond. See you next. Greetings. Oh, shining. Nice to talk to you again. I thank you and you as well. Thank you very much for helping me like you have in the past month. I'll never help you. You helped yourself. Thank you. Pat yourself on the back. I would like to know my friend, she saw what she says is a UFO. It was in a triangle like form, but the top one top ends was cut off and it had blue, red, white, and blue and green lights that were blinking. I would like to know what kind is it and why was it just shown to her? Did she see it in what you call a day or night? At night. All right. One more. When? She said a few years ago. Can you be more specific? Not really. One more. At this time, it is not obvious to me. Therefore either it is simply something that I am not aware of or she may have misidentified something else. Thank you very much. Anyhow. One more. What? What do you think? I had a question on the other. Oh, man, I just forgot what it was called. It was in Stonehenge's name. I want to know, would any of your kind involved in help making it? Not really. In a sense, you may understand the population of your planet are responsible for it and the particular alignments were utilized in what you call variant ceremony that took into account certain what you would call celestial alignments or alignments of the stars and planet. And this time. Okay. Thank you very much. Oh, thank you. Shut it. Come on. Female. I just want to ask you about the impact of that comment and how it affected our universe and directly to the Earth and general hot will be in our lives. Have any bearing? It depends how you look at. First of all, understand it will not have any bearing on affecting you in any external way other than something that you may create to participate in using that as a particular reason. It was a very nice fireworks show and represents your planet's ability to begin to behold and expand out your awareness into more of your, shall I say, general neighborhood. But it is not my particular perspective that what you call celestial events have an actual controlling factor in anything that occurs in your life. They may allow you to be aware of certain momentum. They may allow you to be aware of certain ideas. But ultimately they are more the wallpaper than the wall. Do you understand? In general, though, it will represent the fact that your technology now enables you to see more and more of your neighborhood, which is a part of your expansion both individually but also collectively. Now you will hear various interpretations of this and many individuals will say, well, I did this because the comet had Jupiter. All right? Perhaps that is so. But because of their decision, not because of any fragment impact itself, perhaps something has occurred in their life, that is impactful. And in that sense, the comet would be a reflection of their internal events. So it depends how you look at it. Was there something specific you are seeking? No, I just wanted to know how I affected our universe and how many different it would show us or help. You know, there's always things always evolve to a different level and I didn't know if it affected us. Well, in a sense, it represents because of your expanded of where that you are opening up to new things. It also allows you, because of the physical phenomenon, to explore more about your particular shall I say solar system. So much of the information, much of the instrumentation that recorded the information will allow you to expand your knowledge of the composition, the physical composition of aspects of your solar system. It was in a sense to be hold it or seen by others as well. I personally shall I say, witness it from my craft. And perhaps you can say a slightly better seat, but it is not as uncommon as you would believe. Now you are simply able to see more of the fireworks that will occur in your solar system. And the mere fact that that was detected was through a series of coincidence because there are more eyes toward the sky. So it is symbolic of that very large. All right? Yes, and then I just have one personal question in a way. I just have an elderly mother and I just she has seen all her six, seven children and I just wonder why she in her condition, why she's hanging on to the life she has here, the way she is in her nursing home. May I ask you a simple and perhaps obvious question? Have you asked her? Well, she has a stroke and she has brain damage and so she can't really talk. And she, as you say, right or communicate in any discreet fashion? No, and she doesn't focus and we go to keep that yes or no, on her food unit. She can't do herself. In a situation she's in, I thought she, I was the last one to tell and see her this summer and I just thought, at least she was there, not for me to see her. And I just wondered, well, I thought it was fine, she can know any time. We were all happy that we were able to visit what's there but she's still hanging on. Do understand that whatever your form of awareness is, even if it differs from what you would consider to be a pleasant and controlled form of awareness, it is a perceptive state whereby consciousness is perceiving through a certain set of factors or parameters. So perhaps you can understand, at least from her point of view, that the unique advantage in having such a focus would be quite a personal, shall I say, concern of her own. There's something she just showed that she's feeling that she would like to experience the action here before she passes on. Exactly and to the degree you will generally interpret that she is not aware of this, this and that not realizing that she is aware of something and that something is her exploration. More, perhaps you can say I'm a specialist even than yourself at this time in terms of limited focus. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. I think that the first area has to do with aging. Oh, I'm... Over the last few months I've actually felt as though I'm maybe getting younger mentally and physically. Is that possible? Well, you tell me. Are you defining age as the expression of your vitality? Or are you defining it as physical age of the body? Your vitality can be expressed and increased at any time. So it simply depends on the elaborate set of definitions that your particular society places on these notions. Since you keep... To answer your question more directly, yes, you could get the effect of feeling younger absolutely. If you feel a younger person acts this way and you act that way you will feel your version of what a younger person would feel. That's our clock. Six on, then chronologically, obviously, I am getting older. But anyway... I'm old. Okay. Getting physically older and degraded are two completely separate matters. One of the decisions, one of the notions that individuals upon your planet buy into is that aging equals disintegration, that aging equals breaking down. So they trust in that decision. They live the results of that decision. I'm 70 now. I can't walk around the block anymore. They act that way. And so you see the evidence because of the societal approach, the societal tendency to equate age with falling apart. But it need not mean that. Aging can also represent increased awareness, vitality, excitement, action, living life to the fullest, with the benefit of the increased awareness on a conscious level. You need not look at aging as being one day closer to death. You can look at it as having one more day of life. And it will depend upon your point of view. I think I've heard both you and Bashar indicate that our physical body and maybe brain also are capable, potentially, of like 300 years of life. And my question is, what would be the major factors that should exist were we to achieve 300 years? How would we live or believe to achieve that? Well, basically, you would live the decision not in denial, but in acknowledgement that such a thing were possible and merely have enough things to do that you are excited about to be too busy to die. Now this sounds like humor, but it is quite literal. Generally, now there are exceptions. Understand, there are as many explorations specifically as there are individuals upon your planet billions, but generally, generally people die when they don't have anything left to do, generally, or they feel that they do not. This does not mean that the opportunities do not surround them abundantly. They do. It is a determination, maybe a conscious determination, maybe one that they are consciously remaining unknowing about. But if you begin to decide consciously who you are, you are just too busy. How important, for example, would be good nutrition in that situation. Again, that will depend completely on the beliefs that you are expressing. If you believe that that is essential and then do the opposite, you will create a dynamic, you will create a friction. If you can understand that what you call physical nourishment is simply the matter of trusting yourself, trusting your timing, trusting your body, eating when you feel like it, not eating when you don't, going about your business, not judging what you eat, judging what you walk, you will find that you will reach an equal liberty. And generally, by the way, eat less. But that is neither here nor there. I've had the idea that put some molecules, manims into your body and your body is going to make use of it. Oh, that is one way to look at it. I would suggest until you radically shift your belief not to swallow rocks, but it is up to you. It is the same answer applied to regular exercise. Generally again, that will depend upon your belief. So, radically, if you are engaged in your reality, due to the nature of the way you create space and time and moving things around within your reality, if you are engaged in your excitement, in your passion, with integrity, you are moving your body. Whether or not you need to purposely put aside a time to do so to make up for the rest of the time that you are truly doing things that aren't representative of who you are, which may take the form of being sedentary, both as a symbol and literally, then what you call the need self-determined for exercise makes sense. But if you are engaged in the living of your life, being who you are, that is a very busy activity and you need not put aside time to do so. Do you understand the distinction? Yes, I believe I do. Paul, can I switch to one other quick? Our mutual acquaintance, Kiria, who you know, has asked me to ask you a question. Paul, she is doing some mental health work going into people's homes who have mental health problems and some of them have a history of violence and she ends up maybe as much as two or three hours in their home and they are even maybe talking to her about some of their dreams or activities of using her life to cut people off. And she is feeling pretty uncomfortable about this. And she wonders whether and she has even had a dream or two I believe, where somehow she feels she is being attacked with somebody with a knife to cut her up. Their question is might some of her past lives that she had experienced this and that is why she is seeing feeling so unsafe. She is going in alone, unattended just all alone into these situations that she feels are dangerous. Can you give her any comments? Well, first of all, and again, because she is not physically present to answer, it becomes a bit difficult to be complete. But the idea is why does she find herself in such situations? Why does she remain in such situations? What is it she hopes to accomplish by doing so? Where does her excitement lie in perpetuating such a situation? Well, she is taking responsibility for another individual. There are many, many questions that would come up now. But she in that sense by extension would advantage more by being able to answer them and continue the line of thinking. But I would at first steer her toward looking at some of these foundational reasons for doing what she is doing, what she hopes to accomplish, and what her intention is in that situation. Her original understanding with her employer was that she would not be going alone into these situations. So she has decided to very strongly assert herself that she has to have that original agreement honored or she is not going into those situations that she feels unsafe. Quite a reasonable request. And that situation to assert herself, to reestablish the decision of who she is and not let the circumstances dictate to her, is definitely one of the explorations. But she is going to ask me, well did Elan say that in her past lives she did have such a violent experience and it is coming back to her? May I be succinct? You have only lived thousands of past lives. Only remember a few of you remember them at all because in those few you may have explored similar things as to this one. Otherwise they are completely irrelevant to you in this life. So yes you all have lived lives where you have reaped great violence, received great violence. But does that really need to have anything to do with now other than someone's insistence on rationalizing their presence set of circumstance to some external source that they can do nothing about. Perhaps to capitalize in your past lives you have done it all. So why are you focusing or why is she focusing on that? Make me leave for a moment just in terms of how you act and put out that there is no past life. And look at the meaning in this life. Look at the definition in this situation. Be here now literally and use what's right in front of you. That would be my particular perspective. I think she can find that useful. Thank you. I thank you as well. Two minutes. I have a question that has to do with predictions that have been made about what's like happened on the planet. That's you with the year 2000 in May, May, 16th. Oh my goodness. If you think May was there for an example to be an alignment of planets to such an extent that they gravitate their gravitational pull on the earth will cause something to happen. Something that's good like capitalism and by the way, that earthquake can you speak to that? There is an alignment in a sense of a two dimensional viewpoint from a three dimensional viewpoint which is often not taken into consideration. In making these determinations, there are certain staggerings in that alignment that create a certain balance. It is unlikely that the degree of cataclysmic events will occur that is generally referred to, generally predicted. Understand that throughout your history and what you call the turning of the millennia. There were always such predictions. The turning of the millennia, the changing of what you call the millennia is symbolic and does represent change stepping into a new age in very many ways. But it needs not be interpreted as having to be such a negative change. In the past, change meant great revolt. So oppressive were many structures. The only way that change could be interpreted was by a breaking down of the structure. So many of the predictions are simply sensing of great change and do not take into consideration dynamics that are now in place which allow the transition, allow the change to be more smooth. That no longer require the shaking down and breaking down in full of civilization in order to have a rebirth. Therefore, it is my perspective that you may experience certain events. Perhaps you can say increased seismic activity. Perhaps you can say the occurrence of certain electromagnetic phenomena. But whereas now this occurs on your planet and certain people experience it, many or most are not even aware of it unless they turn on what you call your television. And it will be similar. Already many of these things are occurring on your planet. They have been for quite some time. So from many of your perspective, there will be no difference in the quantity of this phenomenon. Understand? I think so. People that are predictions of people like Nostradamus who existed in a time where when he made those predictions, the society was so oppressive that he could not even come out and say them literally and had to disguise them as literature. So therefore, obviously, the interpretation of many of these events would be through the convention of the times in which he lived. Some of them do seem to literally come true and others will not. Others have not. One of the things I've often thought about is that this pre-predictions of changes or ends of the world kind of things are not necessarily a physical end of the world but more like a change of the world as we know it, which sort of has to do with things you are saying about moving on to another level of consciousness. Right. So I guess what I'm trying to say is there's been a prediction for the year 2000 and it sounds like what you're saying is that basically you see a change but not necessarily it has to have a kind of change but a change with a change in the view of the consciousness of the people on the planet. And you will find as the days, the weeks, the months, the years rolled by, individuals more and more are beginning to entertain. Many of the things we are disgusting. That generally will reach what you call, again, for lack of better terminology and I do not mean that in the negative sense a critical mass or a threshold. Now is my particular prediction? Everyone else gets a prediction? I might as well take one. That particular threshold will more be reached approximately your 2012, 2015 year with another wave of it approximately your 2020-2025 year. But that is simply based on the energy as it is available now and can simply change with one person's decision. One person's change. One person makes a difference. And it is only the person who decides to real eyes to make that real, expressing that as a decision with trust and action, that is all it takes to see this. But it is unlikely that a single person will be the seeming source of the change. It will be that seeming person within all of you. Is this addressing the point? Yes, I think so. I kind of often work with two of all of the television television programs that are coming on now are a way of just making people more aware of the different possibilities. Well, absolutely. But understand that you are all collectively daydreaming as you expand your awareness of the possibilities and certain people are in the position to make them into TV special of the week. Thank you. I'd like to like to thank you for the help that you've given me in the past and things that are something are working perfectly for those I am very grateful. Oh, all right. I thank you for helping yourself and using me as an excuse. But to understand, you need not stop with the some things. I think that we're towards the others, but there are some that are perfect right now and I'm using those as an example as an example that the others will become great. Given an opportunity come of alignment, you can utilize what you call the positive circumstance to both of yourself. You can utilize them in a positive way, but still it would require for you to go the next step, so to speak, to reassert the decision. Not because there's anything out there that would seem to indicate it because you say so. That's important part to reassert the decision and to go with that. No matter what else happens. Each individual is constantly, shall I say, offered option. You offer these options by the way to yourself. But always when you choose, you are choosing from an available option of which the word option presupposes there are other options. So pick and choose your options consciously. There is always an option of empowerment in any given situation. Sometimes it is not to use the situational mechanic as evidence, but utilize your knowing this, your intention. Intention is a direct expression of conscious creator. Intention may sometimes imply this is not what's in place right now, but I intend it to be in place. And the fact that it's not in place right now reminds me that I intend it. Opportunity is a lie. All right. Yes, thank you. Hello. Thank you. May. Yes, Elon. I have a few questions concerning the way we relate to each other on our planet. In terms right now, the United States is poised to invade a country to the south of us called Haiti. And my own feelings around that, and I ask the confusion of this, I mean, hearing some of the things you say, it would seem to suggest that we would allow the people in Haiti to solve their own problems, that they are responsible for creating the reality the way it is, and we would trust them that they have the power to do what it is that they need to do to work through the situation. Is that your personal perspective? And the quote unquote individuals with their quote unquote finger on the trigger may have a whole different set of how to look at. But is that your personal point of view? Well, there is your personal point of view. And then there is your perception of the point of view of others. Allow me to say before you proceed, that was perhaps a rhetorical question. Is the same as violence. Condoning violence is expressing violence. Not saying no, I don't agree with violence and then being violent. Do you proceed? My own personal view, I contain both views. If someone is a thug on a playground to use an analogy, and he is bullying everyone around, the people if enough of the other children would get together and decide we do not allow this type of behavior on this playground, you can bully yourself if you want over there or whatever. But there is a collective decision and the other children come together. And then the bully is not enabled to oppress or dictate to the other children on the playground. Oh, right. But they need not beat him up in the process. They can simply show their unity and their simultaneous taste and posture. So I'm looking to understand a way that like our United Nations could approach a problem like this that would respect the integrity of all the people that would not be there in violence, but would be there in the support of a more unified and peaceful way of existing with each other. Is that possible for us to have that? Absolutely. But do understand that you are simplifying what you would call a very complex set of situations and circumstances. So therefore, perhaps you can say, I would not be able to give you an overall blanket answer that would address the multifaceted aspect of this particular situation. We do not approach things the same way upon our planet. So when a situation such as that, we don't necessarily formulate advice as much as perk up and watch what happens. You understand it is not simply a matter of a bully and people coming together to quell the bully. There is what you call many political overtones to what is going on from both sides. And it becomes, perhaps you can say, a bit too complex for the purposes of this interaction to discuss the very, very intricate dynamic. But my particular approach in a similar situation would have never issued such what you call military threat to begin with. So already you have a set of circumstances in order that would not be our approach and not finding ourselves in the situation, we would never have the reason to make any decision of what to do with it. And it becomes, again, largely a matter of something that we will witness, trusting in a positive outcome. So if you were a president of our United States, you might extend your friendship to the people of Haiti, extend your trust that they will work things out for themselves. You would not be bullying or you would not be sending threats of military intervention or that type of approach. Regardless, and again, this is quite hypothetical, I am not a politician. I would analyze the situation from all its aspects and having that degree of information have many, many different options, many of which have not been discussed. So again, we are speaking hypothetical, what if, what if. I am not in that situation. But I can guarantee you no matter what my conclusion was, based on the evidence, based on the option, briefing violence would not be necessary. I apologize, I do not mean to be so vague, but you are asking a complex question and asking for one simple answer from beings who do not even express any degree of violence. Well, I guess we have some complex problems on this planet. You have complex situations that will allow you to all learn no matter what course of action is taken and will allow you to each decide in a similar situation what's going to be what you would do. Now, a similar situation would take the form of perhaps individuals in your life. If what you perceive results in what you define as mistakes having been made, that gives you the opportunity through awareness of not making a similar mistake in a dynamic that would arise in your own life from the lesson learned. So all you can really do is be aware of what is occurring, use it to your own positive advantage. By all means, if you disagree with the action being taken, write a letter, make a phone call, take the action consistent with being that person. But that is the only option available for you. You do not have the option to withdraw the troops personally. You certainly have the option to formulate your awareness and understanding about the situation if you should so choose to keep being aware of it to begin with. Well, it attracts my interests and I do take opportunity to voice my opinions to our leadership. And I seek to have some amount of wisdom in some sense knowing which way to go with that. Are you aware of all the complex dynamics? No, that would seem impossible for anyone person to be. Well, that is not so, but I understand what you are saying. So from the degree that you are aware of it, you generate a conclusion and you let that conclusion be heard. In your circumstances, those are your only options. So I do the best I can. And that makes the difference in your life. If it makes the positive difference in your life, this seeming external situation has occurred, had whatever ramifications it had, and you derived positive feedback and increased your awareness through it. So it at least also had that effect. Does this make sense? It makes some. I am taking in a lot of information and trying, especially I can't integrate it into a... Integrate it. You need not try. No one. One moment. Is that all? Yes, that is all. Thank you very much. One moment. From your perspective, everything you attract is a symbol that you can use. It is either a block, a hurdle, or it facilitates your understanding. If you allow yourself to be hungry, to use all situations that you become aware of, to grow and to accelerate your awareness, you will get a positive effect out of them that them will enable you again to do certain things that will actually make the world quote unquote the external world a more inviting, exciting, and positive place. So assume that you have created not the situation necessarily, although on some level you have, assume that you have created that awareness of it for a reason and allow yourself to use in whatever way you can, whatever you learn from it in a positive way. I think that's helpful. So my fascination and my interests and all the things of the world, whether or not my personal view will shift anything, is a benefit. Well when you take your personal view, you shift your entire reality. Not a minor thing, a major thing in your reality. And as your reality changes internally, the external reality changes to fall into suit and your perception of it will change what you attract, what you become aware of will change who represent the new understanding. So as paradoxical as it seems, as different as it may seem for how you have approached your life years before, use it in a positive way, whatever that means to you. And if there is an opportunity to interact physically in the situation that is practical and within your excitement by all means do, but that is all you can do. And you are only responsible to others for yourself and your own awareness. So does that affect you? Yes. That is very helpful. Thank you. Male. No need. Try to keep this brief. First. Oh, reading this. Read that. Yes, read it. Proceed. Describe what you are calling a cliche. My hip problem with my skin that it cracks and it's gotten very dry and it's very difficult to use my hands. And I wonder if you can tell me how I can overcome this problem. It's done a real problem for me for a year and a half. I never had the problem before. All of a sudden I have a good call time with my skin. What are you already doing for it in terms of what you generally refer to as treatment? In four different doctors, I've been to a medical center, tried all kinds of different things medically. But I believe in what you are teaching us. I know how I can overcome this problem. Oh, first of all, transforming something is far different from overcoming. Overcoming it already implies that it is such an obstacle as to not be removed. So therefore first of all, think in terms of transforming, allowing it to serve you so that it can move on and it is a symbol. Now understandably, there are certain things that perhaps you have not been able to quote unquote do with your hands that you used to. And you have concentrated upon this yet. Not really. I try and operate as best they can with what I have. But I would like to move on fast as you get my skin back again. No one is all your skin. Oh, first of all, understand that what you call your skin is you. It is not separate from you. It is not necessarily the barrier you all assume it to be. It is an interface. It is where you perceive your internal environment, meet your external environment. But there is also in this case the symbols of the hand. And in them being as you have called it, somewhat incapacitated, what has this forced you to do that you would not have done if that had happened. I think about that question. I've had the problem both of my hands and my legs, but primarily my hands. Oh, when you picture your hands, answer honestly, do you picture them as getting worse or do you picture them in their helpful state? Well, I picture them in their helpful state and would like to return to that I always say. Do you really picture them in their helpful state? Or do you picture them as they are and perhaps fearing that they will get worse? Mother, maybe truth. Oh, is it already? Well, I know I have gotten rather discouraged because I can't seem to get past the problem. If I certainly concentrate on good health, I will do what I need to do. I just wonder what avenue should I take to, I mean, obviously the doctors have solved the problem. I need to solve the problem. I am wondering if you can tell me how I should have said or what I need to do to get past this problem. My suggestions would be as follows. Allow yourself to continually picture your hands, what you call mentally, as being already perfect, quiet, picture yourself in your mind, being able to bend your fingers, move it, and then feeling perfectly fine. When you then open your eyes, do not let what you see talk you out with. It is very akin to what we discussed at the beginning of this interaction. Deciding who you are, trusting that that decision has made it different and then acting that way. Now, also because of your physical reality, you can make a veil of substances that you feel may accelerate this on a physical level. My suggestion would be to remain as natural because of your complex belief system about this as possible. So what you call natural ointment, natural creams, what you would refer to generally as aloe and so forth, is something that falls within your own belief system from my understanding. But furthermore, and again, further most, I do not allow what you see to talk you out of the decision. You may in that sense be saying, I picture my hands as perfect and pliable, opening your eyes and saying, well, obviously they are it and perpetuating it through shifting the decision using the external evidence. Does that make sense? Yes it does. Do you understand how that applies to what we have been discussing all these things? Do you think in that sense that that is too simple? No, that is as possible, I would like to create my healthy hands again and I think you have tried to give me the evidence to do that. All right. Then I think we will make one more suggestion. All right? Give yourself a hand. Thank you for allowing me to share. What you already know and simply now can apply. What I have spoken of throughout this evening is applicable across the board. You have provided yourself very creatively, generally what some people will refer to as very strong evidence against the decision. But it is truly no difference in anything we have discussed, situationally. Decision, decision, trust, conviction and action is all it takes to transform anything. Is all that has allowed you to get to this point to begin. So play around with that. All right? Thank you very much. There will be but a few moments remaining to this interaction. I would like to share with you some of the experiences I have had the past few months and then ask your question. I also got to view Jupiter. I went into one of the chambers here and from there traveled out to Jupiter to watch the comet hitting and I did that for my time. Just a few moments but I actually saw one hit. It was straight on. It was beautiful. Perhaps I was mistaken saying that I had a better seat. I like mine really well. The eye of Jupiter as we see it was from our photographs that we usually have what I saw it was actually redder. Well also swirling, moving, noticing. I noticed the color. I guess I was just so surprised that it was just a decision that you do not usually allow yourself to be privy to see. It is literally what you would generally call the eye of a student. It is in motion. This is brief. What you were describing about observing energy I experienced in the Yucatan one time when I was traveling and the circumstances were such I did not have a lot of sleep and not a lot of food and yet I had plenty of energy because I was observing it directly. I feel I was observing it directly from the sun. The whole time felt lighter and very energized by the whole thing. It was just interesting for me to hear you discussing energy. Oh thank you for sharing the inspiration that you derived from your journey. And also one time in an interaction here you mentioned and you express it very dramatically that I would need. Oh Maya, well I did so. A few months ago I met him through an album he did and we become good friends. He is coming here to this area soon and perhaps in the future we will be doing a journey down to his people. I guess also because of him I have connected not on a physical level yet but through meditation and things with the council of the Maya and actually also witnessed part of the ceremony they had a few months ago that was very important to them and I just appeared in it very briefly. Well how exciting. Yeah that was very exciting. You saw the time? Well I am nervous. Yes it really was very exciting. And I have also started to access how they travel physically in time. That time for example I thought that I had traveled to a cave in Colorado and I actually was witnessing something that was taking place in the Yucatan. And it was very special actually. So anyway what I would like to ask you is during that same interaction you mentioned to me quality that I had and it would help me if you reflected that back to me. And I think it's about when you take groups to these sacred places and things like that and that I had some of those and I would like that reflection back from you if you would. If you will share with me what you already understand perhaps maybe I will accept. Now now. Okay I love the places that I am going to. I care what happens to the people and I want experiences for them that are expansive and life enhancing. I also attune myself with the places so I have that to offer and can help the group to do so. Do you insist that they enjoy the area in some particular way or will you make the allowance to allow them to create their own style and their own method of appreciation? I would like them to be able to there's a lot of allowance for them to be able to create that. So yeah. The quality of the law. All one. Yeah. What else? Knowledge. Some of the knowledge that I have to impart. That's what I'm talking about. I'm going to tell some of what is referred to as rituals or ceremonies. We're celebration of the connection between humankind and nature. One with the consciousness of the planet itself and so forth. Right? Yes. Very. Okay. Yeah. And the relationship to the planetary bodies around us that were cosmic beings and that were part of all the cycles and the sort of grand play of these things in the universe. A lovely resume. What could I possibly add to that? I don't know. I think. Shut it. Male. This is another UFO sighting that was seen by a young friend of mine who was in Massachusetts. I was up there for the past two weeks. One night he went to bed and he looked out his window and he called me, the whole people, and he was in the middle of the room and he was talking and he said he was trying to get a shape with blue, red, yellow lights and then all of a sudden a circular, white, light in the center, flashing and then it took off. I went by his other window and disappeared. I just wanted to have an understanding of the fact that I couldn't relate to him. No. Thank you. I am. You know, me. How? Greetings. Andrew. I wanted to talk to you about, I very much desire to have a life of bodies and joy and filled with love and I've come, I've taken many steps in that direction by doing a lot of things and applying and stuff that I've learned from you and I'd like to go a little bit further with it. So one of the things I wanted to discuss was the apparent persistence of both the least and the situation that that seems to be cropping up in is procrastination with all the consulting that I'm doing. Before you continue, old, new belief persistence, remember you contain all the belief. The new belief or justice persistence as the old, bold are options, options, options. Neither one of them controls you. You choose them. They may scream, I'm over here, but ultimately you decide I will express this belief, I will trust in the expression, I will act according to that. So by all means, invite them to be persistent. A non-preferred belief, which seems to present itself very strongly, very loudly, is one of the opportunities of alignment that we have been speaking of. Your ability to consciously choose the preferred belief and perhaps even thank the other belief for giving you an extra option allows you to continue to align with them. As I have also discussed with you, utilizing your language in a way where rather than saying I am not the old belief, but deciding and phrasing I am the new belief is part of the point. After you phrase the old belief in the decision, perhaps you can say the universe, which is actually you, has a tendency to ignore the knock and just hear the statement. So rather than saying I am not this, I do not want this, say I am this, I do want this, I am this. So these persistent old beliefs, very conveniently for me, fit into the topic of this interaction, perfectly, opportunity of alignment and I thank you. At this time, allow me to thank you all, allow me to thank you for doing me the honor of allowing me to sense your consciousness. I do not utilize what you would call the five senses of the channel and hear, see, smell and touch you so much it sense you in terms of yourself as energy V in terms of yourself as efficacy. From my perspective again, you are all simply part of my dream, but I love my dream no less and in fact, perhaps more because you are all a part of it. And so I thank you for allowing me to appreciate that much more of myself. And perhaps if you wish you can follow the same lead in thanking yourselves and the others that you perceive that you interact with. I remind you, you already create your reality, you already in any given moment decide, you trust in that decision and you act. I am not suggesting that you do anything that you are not already doing. I am simply suggesting that you can be aware of it and you can consciously apply what you prefer to be who you see yourself to be and allow your reality to milk out any of the shall I say persistent old belief that come up for you to address by choosing the new belief instead. That is all it takes. You do not get rid of any belief, there is nowhere to put anything to you are the entire reality. You assume you become the new belief because you stay told and because you deserve good day to all of you and they found and love you. Good night.
