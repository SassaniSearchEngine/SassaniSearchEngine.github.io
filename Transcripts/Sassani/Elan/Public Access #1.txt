 All right, I'll say, how are you all this evening of your time as you create time to exist? Thank you very much. Allow us to begin this interaction, this evening of your time, with a few questions. Before we begin, we will ask, as you say, a few questions. And if this applies to you, simply say, I, all right? Clear enough. Oh, thank you. How many of you out there believe in the existence of extraterrestrial civilization? Well, all right, very good. Good start. How many of you out there believe beyond the shadow of a doubt now? Not speculate, but believe absolutely, that your government knows all about us? Oh, almost as many. How many of you have understood when we have shared with you the idea that you create your own reality? Everything is an externalized reflection of you, and therefore, literally, literally, you are your government. All right, a few less, but still a substantial enough number to proceed. Allow us to entitle this interaction. Public access. We begin on the following notes. We have discussed many times with individuals in your society, the notion that there is an extraterrestrial networking community, so to speak, that we have for the purposes of a convenient label called the Association of Worlds. There are many other names for this, and it is unimportant for this interaction. To what you refer to it as, but the idea is that such a body, so to speak, networking body exists. We have also shared with you that individuals are invited to, so to speak, join or participate with the association. We have also mentioned that perhaps you can view yourself if you wish as charter members in a sense. In that globally, shall we say, as a whole, the membership has not been accepted, but there are enough individuals to put you in the running, so to speak. What we will propose this evening of your time is a co-creation, a project, if you will. We have through other channels proposed such projects in the past, and they have not necessarily culminated, perhaps in a way, that you would find satisfactory. Therefore, we will begin with this particular group to make the following proposal. Our suggestion is as follows. Understand it is simply a suggestion. If it appeals to you, if you are excited by it, by all means, participate. If you are not, that is okay. We propose that, and this will mostly be from you, but it will be a co-creation with us, that you begin, either individually or collectively, to begin to comprise a proposal, a project, if you will, that will be presented to your government, that will explain to them an accessible way, an accessible way, that they may now release to you the information that they have, so that that information can now become part of the public mass consciousness and not necessarily be a rumor, per se. So therefore, what we ask for those who are interested in participating is that you begin to comprise a program to begin to access in a public way this information. We have often, when speaking about communicating with other aspects of yourself, in this case your government, always use the terminology that you would find it most conducive to communicate with them from the perspective of subjecting rather than protesting. In general, protesting is saying what you are doing, think and offers no alternative. What we are suggesting is the formulation of an alternative, an attractive alternative. We have dealt with many societies, and we have been, in that sense, part and parcel of these styles of projects in the past. We have some idea in that sense of what will work, however it is your planet. Therefore, if you are now willing to take the responsibility, you will find that this particular decade is a conducive gateway, a conducive energy gateway toward the dispersion of this information, the dispersing of it. Understand, we have, in that sense, sensing the energy of the present, suggested that there would be in your next year some communication, some revelation, but that it was far more strong and likely to occur in the odd number of years of your 1990s decade, 93, 95, 97, 99. Anybody in this room can change that timing. What we are discussing now is not creating this idea, it exists, and there is momentum behind it. What we are discussing is the acceleration of the timing. For many things upon your planet have, indeed, accelerated faster and beyond that which we initially sensed. Not that we are anybody special to be doing the sensing, and again we have explained many times what predictions are, simply a sensing of the energy of the present. The sensing of the energy at the moment that can change, even with the mere knowledge of the prediction, but things have been accelerating in such a manner whereby you can now get quite involved. And you will find, although you can do this individually, that if you will begin to work together in any capacity, you will literally be functioning as per say a chapter of the association earth. If you will now, when you have a bit of time, begin to compile your ideas, constructive, suggestive, alternative ideas through which your government can utilize to comfortably begin to disseminate the information they already have. We also suggest again including in your proposal the idea that you are all grown up now, that you can in that sense now be responsible for the creations of your own reality. And that perhaps they are very useful in the organization of network instructors upon your planet, but they no longer need to be responsible for your personal power, for this is one of the impediments. That is, in that sense, perceived by what you label to be members of your government. Also, you may explain that although when this knowledge is publicly known, that yes, their job description may change, but they will not be unemployed, for this is another fear. The definitions of things will change upon your planet once this is widely known, but this does not mean that it needs to be in a negative way, and that anyone needs to lose their job, or we understand this to be of concern. What we propose is the following. In these interactions, for the next few months of your time starting in your next month, we will make a space for the beginning of the proposal. Again, you will do most of the legwork, so to speak, for it is your planet. We, however, will co-create with you the fine tuning of the proposal, utilizing again the knowledge that we possess in what has worked in other, similar, though different situations. Anybody who is interested in that sense in this type of thing can now also say, I. Oh, thank you. Do understand, there has been the notion that you cannot make a difference. You can. One single, powerful, cohesive, workable, program, can make a difference. And it is simply, again, a matter of providing alternatives that may not have been considered, and not chastising in any way for the fact that the information has been withheld up till now. There can be an understanding from your point of view about why perhaps they felt it was necessary, so that they, in that sense, are not on the defensive if you understand what we are saying. So, therefore, you can facilitate your own public access to this information. There is, in a sense, what you might call, a timetable for the releasing of it already, but it can be accelerated. It is not that it needs to be, but it can. And as you can see, as the face of the political body of your planet is changing drastically, that is simply indicative of the high degree of ability to transform within the transformationality of your planet. So, if you say that you wish in that sense to have this information and be able to begin to consider interacting with us, now is the time to do something about it. And it need not be laborious. If you wish, play a game. You need that work at it. It can simply be a fun play of ideas. It can be a fun exchange and interchange of ideas. And a loving beckoning to what is only, again, an extension of yourself that you're all grown up and ready now to find out the truth for the truth is known by many, but only surmised by many as well. So, therefore, your willingness to become active on this level will result in your being in, so to speak, on the ground level of this revelation. And a revelation, it will be. That is one thing we can guarantee. Therefore, for allowing us to continually interact with you in this fashion, we thank you. We have always said that although we desire face-to-face contact with you, it is not something that we need or that is necessary, however, it would be a lot of fun. Your willingness to consider us as your equals is all well and good. Your willingness to open up dialogue with other realms of consciousness, with other civilizations, with other dimensions of consciousness is all well and good. But you are on a physical world, with other physical beings, and physical scenarios. So you can, shall we say, most strongly begin to open the lines of communication within your own society. And that action is reflective of the belief that we are indeed existing. Therefore, in a sense, it is taking the reins into your own hands and in a loving, constructive way, providing a program again for the releasing of what information is being used. Of what information there is and the networking and sharing of other information. For there are quite a bit, quite a large plethora of misunderstanding regarding extraterrestrial communications with your planet. There are many negative distortions that are simply not the point. And your willingness to open up a dialogue can also as well be an opportunity from your perspective to voice that point of view. For any individual who is physically interacting with extraterrestrials upon your planet at this time will only be able to perceive the nature of the interaction according to their own belief. So if they hold negative beliefs, these interactions are very clear and pure mirrors. So therefore, nuances of the interactions are simply reflections of the individual's consciousness, perspective and belief system. Therefore, again, not to be facetious, but it is no wonder that many individuals have a negative interpretation of it. For you have been brought up with many negative ideas. So therefore, when you are willing to suggest other positive interpretations, you add in that sense to their choices and allow them to begin to view from other belief systems the positive outcomes, the positive results of such a style of interaction. Therefore, we thank you for this. For the past two years, Bachar has been a conduit. In a sense, you may say, loosely speaking, using your vernacular, a coach to Andrew. Bachar's energy was quite attractive to Andrew, and so therefore it was deemed in that sense that that would be the acceptable conduit to allow for the fulfillment of the original agreement, which was between Andrew and his own. And so therefore, you can understand that it has been said that all along you have been receiving a blending. You may consider that Bachar has been the carrier wave, but along has always been present. There was a particular threshold, a particular period of timing, at which, shall we say, the interactions were more presented by Alon. And that again has been from the one labeled, thank you, thank you onward. But it has always been a blending. So there is no need for any style of remorse. You have always been dealing with aspects of this consciousness as well. Any individuals who have found themselves attracted to these interactions continually have had just as much a connection, and many times a stronger connection with Alon, Alon, than Bachar. But there is again much love between individuals and all the members of our society who interact with you in this way. Understand that although you have a tendency in your society to view what is occurring as an ending, we only view it from our perspective as a new beginning. Aspects of Bachar will always be present in these interactions peripherally and gently. But again, Alon is the new main conduit in that sense. And because that is the actual fulfillment of the agreement made, there will be many openings, many opportunities for other styles and other consciousness to come through when that is fully implemented in but a week or two of your time. Again, I am now speaking as Alon, but what you would consider to be Bachar is also quite present for the purposes of this final public interaction in this way. The definitions of the role of Bachar have altered slightly, and Bachar in that sense will no longer be training individuals in this way. We have in that sense explained that he will pull back to only expressing himself in that way through three individuals on a regular basis, at least for the next year of your time. But you will also find many ideas in what you label your media, art, music to come out that will have an influence from that stream. It will now more be the doing rather than the speaking. The speaking has a great value, and that will be continued in that sense by Alon. Also allow us at this timing to thank Andrew for he has from our perspective done excellent. There is a minimal amount of filtering that occurs in these interactions, and there has been a particularly high degree of diligence on his part, despite what you label, doubt or again, negative faith. And there has been a continuance of the action for the willingness to provide these styles of interactions, no matter what the personal frame of mind was. And as we have said, your belief can always be traced through your actions. So therefore, we thank him for providing the actions that tell the universe that regardless of the fact that there may be fluctuations, he believes it. And we thank him as well. Allow us now to proceed to the sharing, for it is always our joy to interact with you. We always only reflect back to you what you already know, but we are greatly enriched by your reflections back to us. They allow us to learn many things about our particular exploration, our particular understanding of the many, many points of view and perspective of all that is. Therefore, except again, our deepest and sincere, thank you, thank you. For you have all been quite participatory in allowing us to continue to interact in an indirect way, at least at this time. And we assured you when it is direct, we will recognize you all. There is a place for any individual who finds themselves attracted to these interactions. When the societies begin to meet physically, no one will be left out in that sense. So you need not fear in any way, shape, or form that you will be. There will be a form of recognition and involvement for anyone who so desires. That is the style of our presentation, of our consciousness. Also again, before we begin, allow us to share that on the first of your January, 1992. One moment. We will do the best with the translation that is available. Do not fixate upon what we are about to share. Do not obsess with what we are about to share. On that day, simply go about your business. Do what excites you. If you do not, what we are about again to share will not apply to you. For you only have the eyes to see certain things when you are truly fulfilling the vibration of who you are. But if it shall be that the momentum is such, as it is right now, that the first of your year is a clear day. When you find yourself in your out-of-door, look up. We will be in the vicinity. If in that sense you have a need to see us, you are most unlikely to do so. If you go about your business, do what excites you the most, perhaps for the whole day. Without any ceasing, you will be in the right place at the right time. Therefore allow us to thank you for the opportunity to have and make such a direct presentation of our energy and what you would consider to be a physical sense. Therefore allow us now to proceed with the sharing. And again, we thank you. Shirdi. Come on, Shirdi. I'm very happy to have you with us again tonight. And I have a thing to share and have a question. Oh, do you share? Recently, we had a little fun with the people in our radio group on the year on a frequency that we used. Oh, right, no fun. And what we did was the tape that we had from November 23rd where we wanted to board the shift. We played that part of the tape from that point on to allow people to get into the meditative state. And many of the people who went through that state had said that one person in particular said he had met with the shark. And I wonder if you should elaborate a little bit on that if you had any recollection of this. Well, the idea is yes. As we have shared individuals who are willing to submerge, submerge themselves in the idea of those styles of what you might label visualizations do in fact create the interaction. So therefore, yes. Simply you can validate it for that individual that the interaction was quite real, at least from our perspective. Well, I was a lot of fun for me because I had to basically keep control of the transmitter. So I was very much excited about everybody who afterwards came out of this and explained what they had been involved with, what they had been and so forth in the meetings. One other thing I had a question was about 11-11. There's a thing I picked up today about January 11th. Eight. And about the door opening on the 11th. In a sense, yes. So according to the information that I read, it says that it will stay open until the year 2011. Yes. Now this doorway is a doorway of pathway to oneness. In a sense, yes. So between now and that period it will give time for most people on the planet to become integrated into oneness. Yes, and again, as we have shared, when you will begin to validate what it is that moves you and act upon it, within that period of time you will see an effect on the planet. In a sense, there will be the accelerated completion of your willingness to be who you are. As well, there will also be the quick falling apart of anything that you choose to perpetuate that is not representative of who you are. So therefore it may be who you in that sense to begin to define your excitement and refuse to settle for anything less. I just have one final sharing and that is that I was called by the local public access TV station, we have a call on our public access where we, the public citizen, can do a show. We don't get paid for it, but it's just that the enjoyment of doing the programming. And so in February I'm going to start a show called the Intergalactic TV Network. Oh, how are we trying to? And it's going to be where hopefully we'll have information disseminated freely without any obstruction whatsoever. All right. So I just want to share that excitement with you. We thank you in a sense, you may consider that to be part of the project that we had mentioned in the beginning. You can incorporate whatever tools you so find yourself attracted to and utilize them to the fullest extent. I'm hoping that we can meet as a group even between channeling so all the people here that we've all met each other before. And the idea that you mentioned earlier before we started sharing I think would be good for us to facilitate working together in order to provide some sort of, with the coaching or helping of your, on your end of it, to present our program to the government for dissemination publicly of what we're talking about. We go right ahead. We thank you. You can, by the way, have some fun with this. You need not be so concerned. And we thank you. You're hot. Over there, man. What could the number 33 have to do with 11-11? In a sense, it is three times, only 11. But you can understand that 33 in general will represent the physical life age upon your planet. Where individual consciousness crystallizes in a sense. So therefore it is quite again an opportunity gateway age, if you will, to begin to, in that sense, align yourself with your purpose. There is not so much of a direct relationship that we are perceiving other than that, but there is also not a great degree of relationship of numerical ideas within the channel. Is there something specific you aren't seeking? No. Someone asked me to ask that question. Well, all right. Well, what? Bill Decker. He said hello. He can't be here tonight. Oh, and we thank you and send out greetings as well. Is that all? No, I have another question. I read in a magazine about a blind physicist. It works for NASA. Hey, his name is Kent Cullors. And he, he belongs to a group that's called Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. He wants to do that by communicating by radio. Yes, but this is unlikely. For that is not shall we say, a very common format throughout the many intelligent civilizations in the multiverse. Understand, even within your own history, it is only that that technology has been present for but a minute in time. And because of the large stellar distances between your star and other stars in that sense, and the time it takes to travel, very often by the time any such a message would get to any particular society, either they have not entered that particular stage of their development or have already passed it. Also understand that although you may feel because on your planet, it has been a invention or a particular perspective, very often you will find societies will develop never quite developing that style of technology. And far more often there will be the idea you label, able communication, which in that sense, shields any radio transmission. So it is most unlikely within the particular neighborhood that you are located that you will get a response. It is not impossible, but the other thing that we have shared is that the most finely tuned and best representative transmitters and receivers are biological entities. Also understand at least in our society that we do not speak and your radio waves, at least in the sense that you create them, do not quote unquote, Harry Thawke. So therefore it would not be our society's penchant to communicate via radio for we have no verbal communication. I was thinking more on something like maybe more code. Can you think of another way that you can communicate with them? What's wrong with it? I think they believe more in the radio. It is not out of the question. But again, when you begin to lay down programs and processes that will allow the information to be more universally accepted, then the extraterrestrial community will sense your desire to communicate as a whole, not just pockets here and there of individuals. Then there will be communication in one blatant form or another. Is this a thing? Yes. Is that? For now, yes. Oh, shit. Hello. Yes. Hi. I would first like to very much thank Fishear and Andrew for all the assistance and my exploration. And they thank you for assisting yourself and sharing and reflecting with us. Thank you. My question is the other night I awoke and there was this very intense vibrational around me and I couldn't move. I couldn't open up my eyes and I couldn't speak and I couldn't move my body. That is because you were attempting to move in physical means which in that sense is a process whereby you feel you must make something happen. Make your eyes open, make your hands move. But you can understand that you were in that sense so you deemed it to be a physical manifestation in the astral state. And the astral state you move by allowance. You know I was awake in a sense, yes. I don't quite understand. The idea is next time such a thing should occur, relax and simply allow yourself to move in whatever way you will. You will find something to occur that you have not experienced before. Okay. Good. Thank you. Andrew, you're sharing. Come on. Preheams and tools. For one reason or another I've run into a good many temporary detainees. And what I observe is that these people often have one who would turn paranormal abilities. Could you perhaps comment upon this? It is simply that many times although the interactions are often physical, they are also in that sense what you would label telepathic. So this opens up those abilities and then very often individuals will choose to utilize them in addition to the interactions on a daily basis to some degree. It is quite common. Okay. Well, recently as Jada is a friend of mine who in the past has been very, very accurate in terms of projections. It is only that she received a very vivid warning to the effect that a very significant place would hit California sometime in the near future. And that it would be largely devastating because a nuclear reactor would be involved. Do you perceive that? In a sense again understanding our definition of predictions it simply allows certain individuals to be aware of certain momentum and take perhaps what you would label certain steps. But again the rendering and understanding of the prediction as shall we say change the energy of the effect of it. And it can be in that sense distributed siphons really vow by individuals allowing the energy to go through them rather than stopping and containing it in what you would label to be a pinpoint area. I see this is very interesting then I myself for instance were I to affirm that I wanted to siphon that energy then I could be a vow for that energy. Yes. You can also instruct other individuals of that latent ability within them. Thank you very much. A related question. Again, I understand. A prediction is simply an authoring. You can always choose to buy into it and experience that reality. You can also utilize it to define what you do not prefer and proceed according to what you do. So you need not look at this as an inevitable outcome but an offering to allow certain individuals to transform certain ideas. I see. I see. I read a book called The Coming Quake and Enochs was indicated that two plants were built somewhere about 80 miles north of Santa Barbara. And they were 75% completed when it was realized that they were within three miles of a fault line coming in from the sea. So that struck me is rather interesting. They reinforced these plants. They're in Diablo Canyon or something like this. But I know it's very little more about them but I wonder whether they're reinforced against say large waves or anything like that off the ocean. How do you like him for an answer? I'd be very interested in this. The assessment of the vulnerability of these particular plants. The idea is that if there was as you say the big one, there would not be much that would be safe from it. But again what we are speaking of is dispersing that energy so that there may be in a sense many small ones. Beyond a certain level, almost anything will fall. I say. Do you perceive that the fault that is called the Hosbury fault? It comes in offshore from the ocean and into Belksa, the middle of California or at least somewhere north of Santa Barbara. Is that at all potentially active? It's strictly in physical terms. Potentially. Well thank you very much. And it's a one provisional thing regarding the crop circles that Maria requests that the golden star creates somewhere on our planet, a big happy face. Well alright. The idea is water is given to you. Thank you for the request and think we suggest that if such a manifestation takes place, it will be deemed by the majority of your population to be a hope. I agree but if we're safe. But keep your eyes out. It's pretty much. Thank you for your suggestion and for your willingness to shake things up a bit. Thank you. Thank you much. And you do. Shirley. Hello. Over there. Well, driving in my apartment actually is actually quite late. I'm a department of female-e. Yes. And she's very beautiful and very reassuring. Again, they all are. And I wasn't sure, well first of all, I wasn't sure whether it was me bringing something back from my dream reality or if it was like her actual presence. And I felt, I don't know, I guess I keep saying reassuring because that was the sense that I was... She was so, um, seems like timid, I guess. In a sense, you can understand, first of all, that your dream reality is one of the meeting grounds for these interactions. But that takes away nothing from the validity of the experience last evening. You are simply allowing yourself to begin to communicate with certain individuals that you have also made a dream. Can you share with me what civilization she's coming in? It is very closely related and tied to our own. The idea is that you, if you are desirous of the continuing and expansion of that relationship, can simply request it. And then, when the timing comes, that's such a thing occurs. Simply dialogue. You can be that active within when you sense the presence is there. You will find direct answering, for instance, questions, direct sharing to your comments. Okay. Um, the third significance in the timing of it is saying that. Oh, no, no, no. Yes. It has the game to do with the gateway that is opening. Your 1992 will be quite busy for all of you. And to you for allowing the door in a sense to be slightly opened, we have been knocking. And to you over there. Helene. Yes. What person or group in our government had collection controls the information about extraterrestrials? There are, shall we say, a few, the only name that we shall share since it is, as you say, in the way that you structure your society is your president. He is quite aware. Perhaps there are misunderstandings. Perhaps there is some fear, but he is aware. He has been involved, as you say, on many of the upper echelon levels. All right. That is all we are allowed to share right now. You said in Russia that you have information on it. Who over there holds the information? Again, most primarily what you would label to be the highest officials are at least one immediate access. There will be perhaps as you begin to develop your plan more of an elaboration of certain individuals that you may communicate with as the channel in that sense is led toward understanding who they are. But for now, being that that's the top dog, as you say, that will do. Okay. What role will interaction with extraterrestrials with our race have in the evolution of consciousness on our planet? Well, again, a great leap in consciousness, the evolution, as you say, of consciousness will occur prior to the interaction, and that is what will allow the interaction. But simply, open exchange will provide a high degree of mutual enrichment, jumps in technology, jumps in ideology, and the idea is there is much to share from our end, as well as there is much to share from yours. There will be some changes, but you will still have a cohesive society. Okay. It seems that the consciousness, at least for me, in my life is largely through my five senses. I look around and perceive things with my senses, but it's the kind of changing of consciousness that you're talking about, one where we'll spend less time caught up in our senses and more kind of communicating in our minds with others like you perhaps. In a sense, but you are still physical beings, having chosen to manifest a physical world. So there will always be, at least in this lifetime, and a few to come, the idea of what you label the utilization of the senses. Though again, the idea is that as your perspectives change and become positively oriented, that is what the senses will perceive. Positive versions of all the input. My senses will see one-ness with my eyes. In a sense, you can also perhaps utilize the terminology that they will become more acute, not less, not more diffused, but more acute. Things will be clearer. Vision will become clearer. More brilliant colors will be brighter. Sound will be brighter in that sense. You will have a heightened degree of appreciation of the reality you have chosen to experience. Now to some degree, societally, you may say some degree of your society is in denial about having chosen it. This dulls the literal. Literally dulls the literal senses. So as you begin to clarify your ideologies, clarify your purposes, and begin to act according to them, you also have a corresponding clarification physically of your perceptions. So therefore again, understand that by having chosen to be physical, you need not escape from this to a better frame of mind of expansion. You can utilize and appreciate this now from the perspective of being positively oriented and limit less. Okay. I've been fortunate enough in this past year to take the year off to kind of work on becoming my true self, expanding my consciousness and figure out what I want to do with my career. Oh, thank you. More and more I've been, and your suggestions have helped a lot. Thank you. You have taken them and you've been alive from the thank you. My question is, more and more I've been living in the present and letting go of other people's opinions and worrying about the future or the past, which those are the things that have made my life unhappy and kept me out of the present. When I'm in the present, I'm happier. And before when you've talked about doing that, your motto was just do it. And I've tried that, just letting go of old beliefs that I need to worry about the future or whatever understanding that I create my reality. But it seems that when I just do it and I'm in the present, it is very simple. You always only exist in the present. Therefore, it is not that it is being imposed upon you that you are futureing, you are choosing in one present moment to spend that moment creating a perceived future. Simply ground yourself to what's right in front of you. Simply look around. It is that simple, that straightforward. When you find yourself thinking about something you cannot act upon, re-ground yourself to what is right there, what you can. What you cannot act upon again confuses the choices. When you factor out what you cannot act upon, you only have left to look at what's right in front of you. And if you see a bunch of choices that you do not desire, you will look a little bit harder to find the one that you do for each and every given moment. There is always one choice that will excite you if you act upon it. You will get that result, really. This has been the past holiday weekend I've been with my family a lot and I was trying to do that focus on what was right in front of me. All right. Again. Try. I learned that lesson left. Almost. Almost. But I was... I kept fighting myself being concerned with what my family members were thinking. Then you can understand that you, in a sense, are also concerned about what you are thinking about yourself. It is not what individuals say to you that creates or allows you to create upset. It is what they say to you that perhaps rings true, that you wish was not true. Does this make sense? Yeah. So therefore, assert if something rings true and you do not prepare it, that you will no longer choose to create that. Bring it back into the moment and always you can ground yourself to any given moment, not by projecting and retrieving, but by looking. What's there? What can I do right here, right now? Look at that. All right. In terms of... And in fact, you can use that as a catchphrase. All right. I am filtering again. What can I do right now? And get to know. Okay. In terms of my career, I've been in business but decided I'd like to work with children and help them achieve... and get involved with the movement to reform education. Oh, I'm fine. To help children expand their consciousness. Can you... I'm looking for a program that will reform elementary education and imbue in the program a lot of the ideas that you have been speaking with. Can you tell me if there's anyone out there doing something like that and how I could get in touch with them? There are many individuals out there. The channel is not aware of a particular name, but you can understand by simply having that desire. And any time within any given moment that one of the choices is an opportunity to do anything about it, act upon it. There is no accident in that timing and your willingness to take the action when the opportunity is right there, right now, not later on, will draw those individuals to you. For it will be providing a vibration that will be similar to those individuals and they will attract themselves around. But again, it is no accident that we are discussing present time. And this can be one of the primary building blocks of your concept in your, as you say, restructuring rather than destructureization of your educational system. The idea of utilizing even with those individuals or children present time consciousness, choosing from what's available and providing perhaps at least one exciting alternative. Can you describe or suggest a way that we should raise our children so that they will grow up to have the kind of consciousness that you've suggested we have? Well, again, very generally, by simply being willing to apply what we are saying, first of all, you will be doing the strongest service because you will be providing a livable living, the evil example. But second of all, as well, also honor their excitement. Also validate their excitement. Allow them to understand that their excitement matters and you want to know about it. So therefore, you can understand and determine how you can fulfill your excitement and also allow them concurrently to fulfill their. If you will start on that simple, basic level, they will learn that to begin with and not need to then unburn many of your societal ideas which are limited. And one more question. How can I make enough money to have the things that I want in my life working with children? By staying in the present, doing what it's like to when you find yourself passing or futuring ground yourself into the moment, that will start a moment of that will because you are being who it is you chose to be. And then allow the universe to provide the abundance to allow you to continue to do so. And again, we remind you that abundance is anything that will allow you to do the job, not only money. So also be quite wide-eyed at what you will allow to deliver to you opportunities. And then be willing, whenever you see one in any now moment, that appeals to you to act on it, do not let it slip in that sense by. Okay. Thank you very much. So again, redefine abundance to be the ability to do what you need to do when you need to do it. And always understand that because you have that ability always, it is simply a matter of seeing in any given moment how you can exercise that ability. Does that make sense? Do you mean to get more creative than that? Do you do what you need to do when you need to do it? Period. Okay. Do you want that one? Yeah. Don't try. Thank you. Thank you. Good luck. One more? Over there, three minutes. Thank you for being with us tonight. I have two questions. Oh, I know one. The first one is that of late during meditation, I have been seeing two individuals in my field of vision on the left side, I see what seems like a woman, which I've at least seen as your side parents. Eight. But lately on my right side, I've seen, it looks like a hologram of what appears to be a male figure. Yes. And on many occasions, it's only in my peripheral vision. If I turn my psychic head, it keeps turning to stay my periphery, but if he, whatever, reaches out to touch me. This is symbolic. The idea being again that they are in the wing, but will not run your life for you. They will make suggestions. They will nudge you a little bit here and there to allow you to unfold and allow you to be lowered into more of yourself. There will never necessarily need be a direct visual communication for where they are not that intrusive. So therefore, you can understand again that there will be subtle signs of what they have to offer. It will not always seem to be a mental communication. It may be your attention falling upon something, a particular article, newspaper headline, or something that will allow you to then take the next step. Okay, so you're saying that Corinne would like to be my consciousness. That's why I can fully see her in a sense. And the other one is more peripheral, but will also represent the male aspect of energy as well, for understand quite literally neither is male or female. You are simply in that sense interacting with that portion of them because you create that dichotomy in your consciousness. But therefore, you can look at the male in a sense as a balance in the way. One other question. In the last two years, I have had many experiences of remembering a very violent, very tortured death from past lives and the things he needs to be being put to death for my spiritual beliefs. That was, shall we say, very prevalent in times past. So therefore, one of the issues that you can understand is that this life is such where you can express it, and perhaps one of the first lives where you can truly, tonally and entirely express it without any danger. But there is, in a sense, a recapitulation of some of the ideas of the consequences to allow you to see where some of your hesitation lies. Use it all. Has the remembering of these deaths have any connection to an at least an emotion? Not directly. Okay, thank you. It is more against the indication of the timing that you can now sing very loudly. You can now literally stand up on the rooftop and scream your spirituality so to speak. And to you for creating such a world. Over there. Just have a cookie. What? I'm... Oh, I'm... Not quick enough. Do you have ears? Are they outside from the hectic? Or, like, more flesh with the head? You would consider them to be external but more flesh in that sense than yours. I think that's something that's going to be any easier. This is why we cannot hear you. Also, understand in a sense that your drawings are interpretations many times of energy rather than direct physicality. There is also quite a bit going on within that expression. Okay. Is that... Yeah. Very good. I just really... Shit. You don't know that. Male. You know. One mole. People. Thank you. Yeah. I do love you. And to you, Greta. In the past, the shore has several times stated that the weather on this planet is due to our history. In the sense that you can understand again very literally your external environment is a reflection of your internal environment. Although you are individuals discreet in that sense, you also create the idea you label a mass consciousness. Your mass consciousness in a sense is not a matter of the nature of the universe. You are a natural environment. You are a natural environment. You are a natural environment. You also create the idea you label a mass consciousness. Your mass consciousness in a sense can also be considered to have representational bodies so to speak similar to your own. Emotional bodies, spiritual body and so forth. Though perhaps you do not manifest physical bodies of your mass consciousness, or it would be far too large physically. But the idea is that the weather patterns upon any planet are always the result of the direct emotional body of any form of consciousness. It can be the consciousness of the planet itself. It can be the mass consciousness in local ideas. It can be individual consciousness. Therefore very often when you will see on your planet, for instance, what you label to be a political storm, for instance, you will also find you will have a physicalized storm as well. So, the presentation, case and point would be your recent coup in your Soviet Union. That was accompanied by many, many weather changes. Whether or not climb a direct? Wait, whether or not climb a storm. And climb it is more a function of the position of your sun to your central storm. Even with the big earthquakes, let's say, in California, what would that then reflect in terms of mass consciousness? In a sense, as many ideas as individuals participating in an overall sense, it would represent where it will occur. Individuals believe that the only way things can change is to first totally destroy the old ideas. That is one way, it is not the only way. Beautiful, wonderful, fair, warm, loving weather. What does that say about what is going on in our sense? In a sense, where you take a measure of the collective pulse of your mass consciousness emotional body, that the momentum of it was quite calm on that day. Is there a role in this subject played by these? Incidentally. Have you noticed the tension for certain individuals, and what you label rainy days to be gloomy? Yes. The idea is they were gloomy first. I see the cause of the fact. Well, very often individuals were labeled when it rained, I am gloomy, but that is not how it began. That's interesting. So perhaps if you will cheer up, it will clear up. I understand there is approximately 2.8 billion overstoles associated with our population on this planet. In a sense, it is a fluctuating thing. Due to the nature of dimensionality. Do they play a role in the weather that we are talking about? In the way that the individuals that they manifest as a mass consciousness, that in that sense has an emotional body indirectly. Well, I'd love to know how local this is, you referenced locality. If the earthquake is in California, does that then mean that the mass consciousness that maybe had something to do with that? Is someone localized to that area in general, yes, and to allow you to see just how local this can become? We will utilize your own example of a tornado, wiping out one house and not touching the next door neighbor. It is that welcome. Wow, that's an extreme example. You mean that, don't you? Okay, well, thank you very much for those answers. And to you, for those questions. Sure, good luck. Good luck. Good luck. Hi. Great. I'm very glad to be here and... I'm very glad to be here. I wanted to just share a dream that I had last week. I dreamt of ancestors of mine, biological ancestors. And they are people who are energies I never met, and they were channeled by a friend in the dream. And they came to tell me how they supported me. They came to tell me that they were there supporting me and that I was here now as like a trailblazer and opening up my consciousness for the first time in our line of biological history or something like that. So, it was really nice to have their support, and I wanted to ask you if you have anything to expand on that about how that works, are we truly connected to our biological families or are we here now creating ourselves? I mean, I know this is both. It is both. That would be the answer. The idea is very many times there is a direct relationship. Other times it is all convenient genetics to allow for a particular expression. It can be easy. In this case you are simply getting in touch with other aspects. And again, perhaps more importantly, being reminded of your ability to illuminate your own footsteps trailblazer. Thank you. I have another question about names. And there was in the literature about 11, 11 and stuff that I've read or thought about names have been changing. People have been taking on new names or changing their names. And I'm wondering what, for me personally, significance do you think, in changing my name? That will be entirely up to you. Because that will be the representative label, if you will, for the vibration of who you are. If that sense you can grow and expand and retain the same name for you, you can understand. You are the same consciousness expressing different aspects. But if in that sense you feel that that name no longer is representative of who it is you have chose to transform into, then you can also as well attract to yourself a more appropriate standing vibration. But we can in this sense not to decide that for you. It's a right. It's the name you have. It doesn't matter whether outside I have one name or in one aspect of me I have one name because there could be millions of names. You can always have a nickname. May we suggest one. Firefly. Thank you. For shining so bright. Male. Yes. Green team. And I'd also like to say a few of the share and thank you very much for his presence. No ask over here. Oh, the interactions with Bashar will continue only they will be internal for you as well as everyone present who chooses in that sense to wish to interact with Bashar. The energy is there and the interactions will now be direct. Actually I just like to make a comment that the gentleman that made had a question earlier about education. Oh thank you. Just reading a book called We The Aperians written by a doctorate in Mexico of education and she has asked them about their educational system. I haven't gotten that far before she's talking about it and I'll see you on the break about it. But I just wanted to explain this in the last minute. We thank you one more. You understand your taking the action of even speaking of these ideas has already yielded attracting an individual. This is what we are speaking about and it will happen that quickly. Do go see me. Thank you. I had a dream the other night. It was so vivid it woke me up that this is an unusual. Oh, I'm at 4 o'clock in the morning. And it wasn't making any sense and then towards the end. I had picked up this young individual with a small boy with large eyes and a rather round head. He was being tossed out from the parents. But they weren't really his parents. I treated him better and he shined me and I said, well why don't you take them. And they drove off within hanging out and said, well I picked them up. And that was about it except stopping me. This is police officer who said you can go ahead because I'm wondering if you have any proper protection. And I didn't have it but the officer said go ahead it's alright. Can you make any sense of that? Oh yeah. Can you? That's why I'm asking it no. What is it in that sense that you have derived? What? The time you were responsible? Yes, but that responsibility was to take care of yourself. And in a sense you can understand the child represents you. It was not a literal interpretation. Aliens do not throw their children out. It's a popular one. But the idea is that it represents an aspect within you what you might label the child. It's not as a comment. And lastly. Do you sense in that way that you have been taught out of the nest in such a way? Um, I didn't think of it that way but yeah. Oh. Do you now understand? A little bit more of the idea that the representations, all of them, were used in the world, all of them were used. But they can only the child but the parents and the officers as well. Yeah. Think we now grant yourself the authority to unleash that child, nurture that child, treat the child within you as you wish to have treated that child rather than squelting it in the way that you perceive the parents to do so. You can use it. Yeah. Are you guys around that night? Yes. Is that what I saw after that? In what in a sense, adjust the position of superimposition in that sense. It was also a connection to a future self as well. Which there will be more about it but for now that will be. At this time we will pause for a short break of 10 to 15 of your minutes and resume contact in this fashion at that time. Thank you.
