 All right, I'll say, continue sharing. Hey. You talked about diversity on your planet. Since like all of your, it sounds like you're all same. How are you individually different? What are the different? Well, we are similar in that we have, as you all do, similar bodies and share a common experience in one way of looking at. But we are all different in the things that individually excite us. So in other words, perhaps you can say colloquially speaking, we have different hobbies, different interests, different forties. And in being physical, still do choose what you colloquially refer to as some degree of focus and focus by definition is generally zeroing in on a particular aspect of reality many times at the cost of the rest of that reality. So as we still do define ourselves as distinct individuals and have different notions that float our boat, if you will, we therefore still maintain differences and still explore various individual projects. Does that describe the idea? Can you give any examples of how the activities different are the way you approach incidents different? There will be a common approach in acknowledging, shall I say, reality, and in that sense honoring reality. By functioning within integrity, there will be a similarity in presentation. But again, the specifics will be different from individual to individual. So for instance, again one of my interests, if you will, or propensity is what you call extra dimensional or extra essthenes, since that is our nomenclature for our planet, communication. So therefore I am quite involved with that. Other individuals may be quite involved with actually, shall I say, recreating or recreating, if you will, upon our planet, thereby utilizing nature, thereby functioning in that type of balance. Other individuals may be interested in what you call music, or what you call colloquially artwork, though that will differ for us and use. Then there are many other similar types of things as your own, what you call swimming. The playing of many games, which by no means is restricted to the youngsters in our society. Adults shall I say play games and maintain that childlike spirit. So again, as the specifics, there will be differences. As to the overall general presentation and attitude, there will be a similarity. And therefore when individuals communicate through channels to your society, although again you will see nuances and differences, there will be a commonality in appearance. Do you look alike on something very much alike? Well, from your perspective, perhaps from ours know, perhaps, from our perspective we see each other in the way that you see each other with the differences. Do you get together and discuss and kind of have disagreements? Not really. There may be discussions, there may be what you call discourse, there may be the presenting of points of view, but disagreements in that sense will only arise when one insists upon their point of view, which we never do. So therefore again we will in general interact with each other, that displays similarities so that we can have a common agreement, a common experience, but there will also be self-definition, self-labeling many times by the attraction of individuals with different points of view and approaches, which we then again get what we will out of except the timing of having attracted them, and then in general we'll move on our way. I think so. I was just trying to understand whether it's boring to be there or not. Boring? Is that what you said? I'm a bit third-density word-death. There is no such thing as boredom as an event. There are bored of mind, but not boring things. Therefore never would we approach a situation with anything but fascination, with anything but complete willingness to interact with it and complete conviction. So therefore what you call boredom does not exist, where we always appreciate and revel in whatever we attract in any given moment and never feel we need be someplace else, or that where we are or is not where it acts, which it always is. Just for the record, I want to say, it didn't come out the way I went to. Well, it came out just like that. And thank you for having some fun. Is that all? Yes, thank you. Oh, thank you. Shut it. Hey, see you later. Thank you. I wish to share. Well, please do. And thank you for your bold willingness to make a statement. I don't feel very bold though. Bold. Is that true? All right. First up, I would like to thank you and Sashar for being with me in my exploration these past summer months. Well, we thank you for being with us as well, for that is an equal expression. Do understand any changes, however, were made by you, matching our energy, making some decisions and taking the action. So ultimately, though perhaps we may rebel with you, you have done it all. Thank you. Thank you. I also want to thank you for unconditionally loving me enough to allow me to get really angry at you. You sure did? No. But the idea, again, is I do not perceive it from a negative perspective and allow myself to function in that way. Well, I understand that. So I got really mad too. Hey, see you did. I have been exploring my relationships with myself and also with the Zayas. The past month I've had, I decided to explore in the rounds of the regression into my childhood. A few doors that perhaps you had not appeared behind before. Yes. And obviously the belief system that I have been denying. Well, the belief system that you primarily have been denying is what you call victimhood. Feeling in that sense that you were a victim in that situation. Yes, because I also felt that I wasn't a victim. I also felt that I had to believe that I was not a victim. Well, you have both beliefs and when you feel you are not a victim, the interpretation of those experiences are joyful. When you feel that you are, that is where the anger-embers have been. For anger-em resentment or emotional responses to the expression of that negative belief. Well, all right. Now, which do you choose? What we are speaking of in the conscious age is understanding as you have just stated so graciously, that both truths are true. And it is not a matter of making one wrong and making one right. It is a matter of choosing the one that is a representation of who you choose to be now and from this point forward. Yes, I believe I've made that choice. I felt that I didn't have a choice. I had the belief at one point throughout this exploration that I didn't have a choice. So, I know I'm still, I don't like to use this term working, but I'm still going through stuff. I'm still on peeling my emotions. I still have fears. I still have anger, which I know is judgment. I really allow them to be expressed fully. Or do you, in a sense, when the anger and judgment comes up, feel them to be completely inappropriate, oh, I should be beyond that and then go into judgment because you feel you are not. Bingo. Oh, why? Therefore, go right ahead and do that. Purposefully. Dive into it. See how it feels. Express that feeling. And while you are feeling it, not now, while you are feeling it, ask yourself what you must believe, then. And then provide the alternative belief with that full acknowledgement, then. And you will find, as you say on your dime, you can turn right around in any given moment by allowing the emotion to deliver the message and then choosing from the options and expressing the preference. That automatically transforms the emotion, again, not from squelting it. So when it comes up, let it come up, but don't just sit there and let it come up. Ask yourself some questions while you are in the midst of it coming up. And if you judge yourself and find yourself judging yourself, so what? So what? Big B. Yes, I feel that at times I have done it and at times I have it. So when you do it, do you not then get the positive transformation? Well, the biggest thing that I was dealing with over a long period of time was not being able to find the belief system that I felt was contained within me that I was denying. Oh. Do you understand that the hinge of this belief is what you call victim? Yes. And all that comes along with that, including blaming the external reality for perhaps not providing the support, blaming perhaps the parents for not protecting you and so on and so forth. Yes, and I think now that that's starting to open up to me and I'm allowing forgiveness more of myself and the judgments that I took on of myself as a child because there were, with my interactions with them, there were some wonderful happy times and so I wasn't necessarily dealing with all negative situations in areas with those statements. But in this moment, with the judgments that you feel now, that is where the reconciliation lies. Yes. Therefore, you can simply release what you call the past and deal with it on a moment to moment basis. You have already forgiven that. You have already cast that back. You have to deal with what you feel now without drawing a path into it. And you will in the now transform as you are about to do. Well, now this brings up a couple of questions that came up. Oh, I'm perfect. For concerning the past and my interactions with them, there was a female who I felt I had a bonding with. And it is, my question is, is she still around? Do you mean physically alive in your contemporary consciousness? I don't know what their life spans are. My question was, what's the life span of a person's life? Well, you would perceive to be their life span would be in some cases longer than yours and in other, perhaps you will say body types a bit shorter. But that particular individual from our perception and understanding would still be considered physically alive yet. Okay. So then... And that is one of the anchor points to which you will again connect. Yes. And one thing I did do from a place of self-empowerment was after these sessions that I had gone through, I did speak to them and told them that I felt that my agreements with them have been fulfilled. Not exactly. No. Well, in the mode from a victim, but I'm not from the government. Now, that is more active. Now, perhaps you will still have interactions but not perceive them as the victim. That will be the difference and that is a completely different interaction from your end. Well, yes. And from my end, that interaction, I'm now fully aware, willingly choose to interact with them in that mode without being a victim. And I'm willing to do that. Then begin to concentrate when interacting with them, either through what you call the method of regression or in present time, to simply say, all right, I know I made an agreement that is obvious, I wouldn't be here. If I did not, now what's the agreement? Why? And begin to look into that. Then you will find it. Why? Think it... But you must be at the stage of being able to accept that you have created it to even be advanced enough to ask such a question. And individuals in the victim mode, in the why is this happening to me mode, do not even come close to asking why did I make this agreement. Obviously, an agreement means there's something in it for me, what's in it for me? Now, part of what's in it for you is the process that you have been going through and the fear that has been coming up and the opportunity to transform that fear. But there is more. Well, yeah, then that I understand that there was more and I feel that now I'm willing to go forward where I have not felt willing to go forward at all with anything. Oh, but in the process, while you feel guilt, anger, frustration, feel it, glean from it and make some decisions, equalize it to all other beliefs, employ what we very purposely began this interaction by discussing. Well, that I will do. I am doing it. Oh, thank you. Just put it in the mailman's. It's not necessary that you do, but it will help you get a result you say you prefer. And... I don't know what else to say. Oh, perhaps we will share again. We thank you for your willingness to open up about a private matter in a public place. Shut up! Shut up! Hello! Greetings! I have a girlfriend. Her name is Carol Guffert-Tard, and I'm kind of asking a question for her tonight. Her younger sister, Lucy, was killed two years ago in Valentine's Day in England. It was a mass accident, and she was the only one that was killed. And Carol asked, has she left the field? One moment. Can you provide a name? Her name was Lucy Guthridge. Now, the answer of the question will depend on the nature of the question. Is she reincarnated? It is not our particular perception that she is. However, it is our perception that she will choose, perhaps not as a she, to remain in the incarnational cycle. But again, now that you are entering as a society, the transformational age, many individuals will wish in that sense to, perhaps you can say, reach some of the benefits that they have been living the many tens of thousands of lives to quote, unquote, seemingly achieve. And many will wish to do that in what you call literally, younger bodies. So still in the field, however, not in the physical earth at this time. Now, that is our perception. I mean, she wouldn't explain to me what she meant by left field. I know her sister was an artist and was creating in the field of clothing. So I don't know if that had anything to do with her question, it was kind of, but that's what you perceived as that she's not reincarnated in. Yeah. In between. So she's considering it then. Hey, is that all? I think so. Oh, shut it. Hey. Could you give us some detailed information on the levels of reality that exists beyond this one? You're starting with the dream state or what we call the astral state. Well, they are not beyond this one. They overwatch this one. All right. Now, what you generally are referring to as the astral state is again a vibratorily different reality. Understand again that what you call God or all that is his consciousness, pure energy, and has a particular pitch or frequency, which you would consider to be a transcendental pitch or frequency. You as a distinct individual to become physical change or shall I say express a version of this pitch, which will stand out in relief against the primary vibration. And therefore you create your own distinct vibration that defines who you perceive yourself to be. Therefore, in creating this in common with other seeming individuals, you create a vibratory bubble or a dimension of reality that has particular parameters. Therefore you all perceive each other. For you are in that sense embarking on a similar exploration and are creating a similar vibratory reality that allows you to all make sense of each other. Now, there are other realities, infinite number of them, as a matter of fact, that exist some of them completely overlapping the reality that you in that sense inhabitate. And what in that sense gives the effect of it being separate and non-perceptible by you is that it vibrates in sync with itself but out of sync with your particular reality. Now within your reality there are various aspects of the expansion of your being which vibratorily seem separated from what you consider to be your day-to-day reality. They literally vibrate at a different rate and in that sense can be imperceptible in a one-way presentation. So therefore what you consider to be astral existence is a reality, is an existence but it vibrates out of phase with your reality in such a way where it is imperceptible to your reality. But when you shift your vibration into what you call the astral, it overlaps your reality so your reality can be perceived from that reality. Does this make sense so far? Yes. All right. So therefore this vibrational definitional difference is what creates the seeming exclusive reality. Now our civilization also vibrates in synchronization with itself but not in synchronization with your own. So therefore with a telescope you would not even perceive our star though we're you to overlap our realities. It seems to be located in a particular direction what you call approximately 500 light years toward your constellation you call O'Roggins. This is quite arbitrary however because our vibrational definitional reality is completely different than your own. And in fact our stream of creating time is actually faster by approximately 10 times than your own. 10 of your years would be perceived as us as a hundred of our years and therefore we cannot perceive each other without differences or a shift in our vibratory reality. Now through technology we have created an understanding of these vibrational mechanics and can actually alter through what you would call space craft. Perhaps that is a misnomer in many ways but the idea is they are vibrational resonance cavities which enable us to shift our vibration and therefore the context of our reality. And therefore the content within the craft. What you call your dream reality is again more of a touching into your totality the experience of your higher self which vibratorily will seem to be separate from your waking dream reality but is again reality. Perhaps you can say in many ways this reality is within that overall reality so you can see this reality from there but not always the other way around. When you are in your quote unquote sleeping dream reality you are touching in with the many other simultaneous portions of yourself as has been formally described but when you wake up into this reality into this dream only will you bring back as a memory those that make any sense and can be translated in these vibratory terms so many of that experience being that it will be non-physical has no translation and hence you will have the sense that something went on but not know exactly what it was. When you express yourself in this particular physical reality that we call third density reality that is a vibratory statement in and of itself and as you begin to express more of the limit less than you are in your own life. The limit less than part of your nature that actually begins to change your overall vibration since your actions change and by the way in a physical universe that is your actions that determine your vibration. You will actually through those actions begin to raise the frequency the pitch of your vibration till you and your society exist in the next slightly more vibratorily expressed reality more expanded. Less condensed but still physical and then from this third density perspective there will be a vibratory separation and you will not perceive each other so to speak. So that is the reason for the line of demarcation in between the reality and then each reality will simply have its own definition and its own vibrational definition. Did that make sense and answer the question at all. We are on the question. Yes, may I ask you a question at this time? Is the Green State the astral plane in the fourth density the same vibratory frequency? No. How are they different? Well the idea is what you call Green State to some degree what you call astral state to some degree will also be experienced in the fourth density. Therefore they are not separate in that sense. There is a version of them so to speak. Now there is a looser relationship and less of drawing again lines of demarcation between them but they are still experiences that we can choose. Are they mutually perceptible? Thanks. More mutually perceptible. More of a like vibration. And Alana is there an aspect of ourselves not an aspect of ourselves in the sense of simultaneous realities but is there an actual aspect of this? Is there an actual aspect of myself from the point of view of this focused experience operating in the astral, the mental and beyond those different planes? Well generally from this point of view you will choose not to perceive it. But again you did wish to skirt around this but there is simply no way from the perspective of the simultaneous higher self absolutely. But one of the choices in experiencing linearity is to seem to have this mutually exclusive reality. So from this point of view, know from your overall point of view absolutely. More specifically what I am asking is there an astral aspect of myself that when developed allows me to perceive the astral plane clearly and an aspect of myself on the mental plane which when developed allows me to perceive the realm of ideas or a bad vibrational level clearly? Well once again from your overall perspective absolutely from this perspective it will seem something that you will explore and become because of again the nature of linearity around it. Well I integrate this experience into my present awareness and consciousness. When you decide to we have offered many times that you would begin in that sense too in that way and bark upon what you call the astral experience and you simply have not sat down and done so. But when you do then you will perceive what you are asking. And again I remind you that you are traveling nowhere because you are not in a body and in that sense perceiving yourself as being within a body and escaping from that body creates perhaps you can say a type of prison experience. But understanding that the body is within your consciousness and it is simply a matter of shifting your point of view from the perspective within your consciousness of that body to another point is a more liberating way to approach it. I see and is it possible once conscious and a dream to then explore what's available on the astral plane? When you are as you say lucidly dreaming or dreaming and aware of it you are in the sense at the next this point where you can consciously experience many of these other realities. That is why I am saying this reality would seem to be within that point though when you wake up you think it is the other way around. I see and what's conscious in the astral plane can I then move to and experience esosonic? Absolutely that is by the way except through the dream reality the only way to do so right now now this may change. But right now that would be the way and when you are in what you call the astral presentation again not out of your body but shifting your viewpoint so that from the viewpoint of the body yes you are out of it but not from the viewpoint of your totality. You can travel in two ways either linearly flying from point A to point B in quite the mechanical way or you can simply allow yourself to understand that when you believe and perceive and feel something it automatically draws itself to you. It automatically manifests without needing to create corresponding steps. So in the conscious lucid astral experience simply by allowing yourself to recreate how interacting with me feels the unique aspect of that feeling you immediately are drawn to our reality and will then yes seem to physically be upon our planet in that plane. And when I do loosely operate on the astral plane am I in fact learning how to express myself and function on the astral plane or is it rather that I am learning to identify with that aspect of myself that's already functional in the astral plane? Absolutely both. From again your linear perspective it will appear that you have learned it from the perspective of an unfoldment but from the aspect of your totality it will simply be real, i-zing something you always express. So the reason aspect of myself right now is we speak this fully functional on all those points. It will absolutely but again that is perhaps from the perspective of your higher self. Much as you would understand that you have all the simultaneous multiple incarnations that are occurring at the same time it brings everything into the moment including that. Could you suggest at this time a specific mechanism to facilitate the astral experience for me? Briefly the idea is again in your meditative state in a state of repose what you hold supine face up. To allow yourself to perceive your body as surrounded by a blue white bubble of energy and understand that you your body is in the center of the sphere. Allow yourself to begin to perceive yourself as also being the covering of the sphere and the con-seer and the contents between the skin of the bubble and what you call your physical body. Then as you begin to feel yourself expanding out simply once again consider shifting your point of view closing your eye at the center point of the bubble that you consider to be your body and colloquially opening them elsewhere. As an exercise as a metaphor this will begin a particular process that will eventually result in what you call bodily vibrations and then seem in that sense to begin to graduate if you will to what you would seem to perceive as separation so to speak. Thank you. In my explorations of limiting belief systems I keep bumping into sex. Well that need not be a limiting belief system again you have particular social more raised in your society. In what way do you mean? In the aspect where you describe your sex act in the sex act of the vicinity of all. Well I also said that individuals upon my planet are completely unconditionally self-loving. View themselves as complete so anything that we attract reflects that completeness back to us in the form of other complete individuals. This particular mind or little point changes the whole thing. Or when you attract a relationship feeling incomplete you can only get a reflection in that relationship of that feeling of incompleteness. You cannot escape this. I understand that because I did that for a long time with many relationships. But what I'm after is something a little bit further than that. Oh in the aspect of choice and on this planet the idea of free choice seems to be relegated to adults and not to children. Well to some degree you will find that this is not completely active. Okay well that's one thing I just planned. But my question relates to my transformation of the sexual interactions and co-creations that took place in my childhood. I was able to transform them and look at them in the aspect of it to self empower me to know that I had choice to be there and participate in co-creating the situations. So what I keep bumping into is the limiting belief system of many people who feel the child in this society does not have choice. So I'm asking you in your society was there ever a time that you felt in your society that the child didn't have choice and had their been sexual co-creations between what you had else and children in your society? No not society by choice. We understand the recognition of what you would call physical maturity. Children are allowed in that sense to explore with each other but we create the separation between child and adult. Usually in that sense we'll attribute what you call child into what you sometimes call formative years, provide the support and unconditional love to allow the child to develop to a point where by they can then begin to so to stay. If you wish utilizing that limited label, they're excitement and what excites them and moves them is always supported and then the proper individuals will always be forthcoming to allow them to explore that most fully. So there is no commonality of that experience upon our planet. On your planet, what very often individual children will represent in these instances is once again unconscious choice which seems in that sense not to be a choice. But in that way as they grow up, as they look at it, as they begin to use their creations and learn something from having made obviously a choice that happened to them, they can in that way begin to utilize the choices that they have made to affect their actions in the future perhaps to the positive. They can learn in that sense from the thing that did not appeal to them and not quote unquote continue to repeat the same perpetration out of a feeling of helplessness and out of a feeling of victim. I understand that. So I guess then my question to you is if the purpose of coming to this planet was to explore limitation, it seems that the greatest limitation that we pose upon ourselves is the limitation about things that took place of a sexual nature in our childhood. No, it is not by any means the greatest, but it is one. Why not the greatest? Excuse me. Did you say gravest or gravest? Greatest. Oh, also bravest. I would look into that sense because I felt for myself that the courage for me to look at it and transform it from what I thought was a victim mode to a self empowering mode of choice to know that it was a lesson and an exploration that served me to be closer to the Christ God within me and to open up. Yes, I would define this brave and courageous, but I'm still interested in the European on it as a limiting belief system that people hide from themselves and how one can open the door in other ways besides the way I did it. Well, the idea is that you will assist other individuals in doing so for what carries great weight upon your planet in your society are individuals who are the systems who have been through it themselves. I scare all of you. So you will begin in that sense to find that you will attract other individuals who haven't that sense explored that victimhood which will then allow you to be of service to them because you know what they went through. Yes, and I do that when I need someone and I feel the right vibration, I'm willing to share, but in many cases, people will run from me. Well, the idea is obviously they are not the ones to be of assistance. I agree. But by still being willing to share who you are, even if they choose, do not interact with them, you have done them some service. I agree. So I guess that what I'm getting down to at the end of my question and sharing here is in trying to define my excitement, I've always felt a need to share. And sometimes I judge that sharing as an imposition upon some individuals. Well, in that way, you can also be sensitive to where they are at. I truly believe that I am. And at the same time, I'm wondering how this needs to share. And I guess I am judging when I say the need. I think it's a preference to share personally, but sometimes I use the word need. The preference to share in large groups that has been with me since I was a child, the knowingness that someday I would be speaking to large groups people. Can you offer me any insight into that today? I simply allow the reflection of your external reality to be obvious. If individuals run, do not pursue them. They are not looking and will not benefit from what you have to offer by it being forced down their throne. Your willingness to let those that do not vibrate with who you are go will create a void that will attract the individuals that aren't. So simply keep your eyes out. Have the clear intention to attract such a group. Again, not drawing in people who obviously are not interested. Allow them on their way. And you will begin once again, as had been mentioned with an earlier example, form a nucleus around you whereby you will be able to express yourself and able to allow other individuals in expressing them. To reconcile many of these ideas within them and use all their creations even back for the positive. For every event in your life is truly a neutral prop with no built-in meaning, and now you are looking at assigning positive meanings. There is usually the societal negative everyone knows that's negative meaning, but after that's all put aside since you are now conscious creators, there is also all right. I know what's bad about this, but how does this serve me exactly the way it is? And that is the wild card, the if you will membership card of conscious creator. So allow the situation to be obvious. There will be no need to impose anything. There will be many individuals that will wish to freely exchange with you in this way. Thank you. It sounds like you are saying it's as simple as writing on a piece of paper, those qualities you wish to have, those experiences you wish to have. Can it be that simple? Like I just write down, I just used to experience unconditional love and excitement. Well, it can be that simple as a concept. However, in the succeeding moment, so to speak, you will give yourself the opportunity to see what beliefs you have that may be in opposition to that. If you accept them by greening from the negative emotions, those beliefs, and again, nail down what you already believe, then yes, it can be that simple. If you are writing them down as a negation of what you already believe, you actually give more weight to your negative beliefs. If you write them down again having acknowledged the old, unpreferred negative beliefs, then yes, it can be that simple. It can be as simple as just deciding after having acknowledged it, trusting that you have changed and acting as though you trust that you have changed. Period. Everything that we say can boil down to those three steps. And that is already how you create your reality. So again, it is not calling forth any new talents simply being more conscious of where you place them and beginning to factor in not only the idea of choice, but preference. For you deserve what you prefer, particularly when you can act upon that preference with integrity. For then it will harm no one. It will not harm yourself. And therefore is only of service to all by being the expression of your joy. Okay, so if I do make that list with keeping me from experiencing it today, we'll come to the surface and I'll. And if you allow that to come to the surface and you glean from it and you acknowledge, oh, yes, I do believe this absolutely horrendous thing. What is again the preferred belief? All right, I am not saying that I'm going to get rid of the old belief that is impossible. There is no outside. Where will I put it? I am saying that I choose the new belief having acknowledged the old. That is the key. So again, yes, if you affirm in denial, you will not get the effect. If you affirm and allow your reality and your emotions to present where your beliefs run contradictory to allowing you to be that you down on paper and then glean from that, acknowledge those beliefs and restate what you have written on that paper. It can be that sense. Okay, and another question is, should I be or would it be beneficial to me to pay attention to my dreams? Well, to the degree that you can use them in this law, for the idea is not so much cleaning meaning that allows you to mentalize the day away. It is cleaning meaning that allows you to apply it into this reality. What bridges this reality to that reality is taking anything you may learn from there and then putting it into an action in this reality. Actions create the reality in a physical world. So as you apply whatever lessons from your dream rather than simply coming to realizations, then yes, you can get great usefulness from those other ideas. And you will literally begin to blur the line between the two the more you ground into this reality ideas from that reality, where they are only now separate experiences because you do not believe in this reality that such things are possible. So you create them as distinct and separate experiences. But as you ground that reality into this reality, you begin to fog the line between the two, no longer having to make a distinction between the two and begin once again to exhibit the phenomenon. Well, did that happen or did I dream it? And in that sense, as there is no longer a need for the separation between what you call waking and sleeping dream, then you will literally, perhaps you can say fall asleep as our society did into a collective life. And if you can tell me what they were, that is not our particular, shall I say, job description. But what you do is not be able to do that. And if you can tell me what they were, that is not our particular, shall I say, job description, but one moment. Are there many the least instilled around the eating of certain food in your household? Often the results of what you call allergies are not so much from the substance itself or that is actually truly impossible, but from the beliefs or from some of the judgments surrounding the particular substance does this fit your scenario. Oh, I say so. So therefore you can begin to redefine how you are presenting these ideas. Understand that individuals in general will attract through what you call hunger, through what you call that type of longing, exactly the foods which will in that sense fulfill them the greatest. Where the difficulty in your society comes in is to the judgment. If it happens to be something that everyone knows is bad for you, then you are imposing a societal responsibility. And that's a societal restriction on an individual whose natural consciousness is telling them the opposite thing. And therefore, an incongruity is created, a friction is created, and then there is, shall I say, the inner battle between what an individual knows to be true for them and what everyone else says should be. Is this a decision? No, I really don't understand that. Yes. One moment. Can you give an example of something that you are in that sense assuming him to be allergic to? Orange food coloring. What is the evidence that tells you this is so? His ear will get red hot if he eats that. Does he ask for the substance? No. Why are you feeding it to him in the first place? There are some things that he wanted, and when I stuff with orange food coloring in it, and when I thought that I had a bad reaction, I just stopped buying it. So, no, he's not. So you have in that sense reinforced that assumption. Yes. Oh. Is that something that you wish to continue to reinforce? If it's not true, no. Well, again, not to be unsettling, but it is true and it's not true. It isn't one or the other, it is both. What you buy into, therefore, will affect your actions, will affect his actions and will create different effects. Okay. Well, I guess I have a lot to think about. One moment. Begin to allow in that sense him to eat the things that you are comfortable, that he is all right to eat, and from time to time, experiment with some of these ideas in lighter dosages. See what comes up, see what effects come up, discuss them with him, and begin to look at some of the beliefs that underlie what he is experiencing from his end. From now, that will make sense as situations unfold. Okay. All right. Then you can begin to get to the foundational belief system oriented ideas rather than just the surface symbol. All right? Thank you. And to you. Sure. You are? Great. I'm at a kind of a turning point or crux point. Well, how exciting. The point of time. And I even have a birthday coming up in about a week and a half. A rebirth day? I was just wondering if my higher self had any like tips or information then. I am rendering this to you from a sensing, understanding the information that you contained and putting it in perhaps palatable form. But perhaps if there was a message from your higher self to you, it would colloquially be in that sense translated as please do what excites you the most in any given moment from what's available and act on that with integrity. That is all. I already knew that I thought he might surprise me. Well, you were surprised. Now, that you have known that for so long, when will you do it? Not why don't you when will you? Starting right now. All right. Then you have just changed. You have decided to change. Trust in that change. Act as though you trust in that change. If you find you are not trusting in it, re-center yourself to trusting in it. If you find that you are acting in, again, opposite viewpoint from that, look at that and realign yourself. Simply continue the momentum that you have just created. It is that simple. All right, guys. Yeah. This is something else. We brought it down to the basics or when an individual does this, you are honoring who you are. You are validating who you are without hesitation, without doubt. And when you do this, the universe responds by in that sense, again, providing the support that you now believe having opened up to who you are, you deserve. And that seems to change. Again, your level of abundance and your entire face of your life. So the simplest of concepts that we speak to your society about yields in action all the rest of the information that we share. It all becomes apparent upon that action, upon that ultimate validation of self. And the ultimate proof that you are validating yourself not through the mentalization and talking, but through the action. Everything else again, Ben Anton. To the level that you have interacted with us with, this would be the most appropriate response to you. I've been doing a lot of written channeling. And I was just wondering, is there a particular entity who would like to channel through me, or am I actually channeling my future self or my higher self? No, it is a conglomerate of many of the above. And you need not ascribe a singular label that will then narrow what you are getting. Simply accept it from the entire stream from which it comes. Is it just the as a sunny stream, or is there another stream involved? There are more than one. And again, it would be inaccurate ever in any communications to factor out your higher self. The higher self of the channel is necessary for these interactions to take place. Oh, yes. Thank you. There will be but a few more sharings remaining to this interaction. Hey. Yes. Can you tell us briefly about that man Jesus, what happened is it is between the age of 13 and 13? Well, in general, as many of you have come to find, you will see that he traveled vastly and accessed much of what you generally consider ancient wisdom and this ancient wisdom went all the way back to what you would call ancient Mesopotamia. In fact, he also attracted certain sources of information prior to that. But there was the learning, there wasn't that sense, the attracting of what you colloquially now referred to as many masters, and was in that sense, very well traveled throughout that entire area, which also would include ancient Egypt, which also would include what was referred to as the Indus Valley, which would also refer to as what you call cyanide peninsula and that entire area. One more. Much of the information that he physically was able to access no longer exists upon your part. So therefore, one of his, shall we say, jobs being that some of that was obliterated, was to in that sense embody many of the principles that had been shared throughout the ages. And what he represented is a version, an extension of the unconditionally loving portion of your math consciousness, willing to express through a singular physical individual the fact that you are all masters. And he never said my way is the only way. He never said you should do this, you should do that. Simply said, look, if you express who you are, if you attract what excites you, if you act with integrity, if you are willing to express unconditional love to all, this is the great power that you can express. I am an living example of it. You can do it too, if you wish. Thank you. Oh, thank you. Have you? May I? There are still a lot of people in our society that are skeptical of existence of extraterrestrial life. Less and less, but yes. And that is actually an option that we prefer to allow you to maintain. Or it is not our desire that we insist that you believe that we exist. And in fact, it is an actual allowance that many will still choose to literally not believe we exist, even when we physically live. There will be those thinking it was faked. Is there going to reach time in our near future where people won't be able to deny the existence of extraterrestrial life anymore, where everyone will know unequivocally that extraterrestrial life does exist and that they are monitoring our planet? You will understand from your experience, since your perception is one at that, that yes, this will occur. You will find throughout the rest of the unfolding of this physical year, culminating with an event in October of this year that your government is actually allowing the dissemination of information they already have. Perhaps by what you consider 1997, perhaps to 1999, you will find pretty much what you consider to be the masses will believe beyond the shadow of a doubt that we exist, but a major shall I say change or swing in that momentum will occur later this year. Can you be a little more specific about what's going to happen later on this year? No, there are a series of events already having unfolded, already seeping through your media in various forms. It is a very soft approach, and the particular shall I say event of October is not yet in that sense allowed to be shared. I see. Side tracking of it. Was there ever intelligent life on the planet Mars? What you would consider to be in your ancient path, it was only shall I say a time frame of several tens of thousands of your years, and you may understand that incarnationally many of those beings then wound up on your Earth. How so? In carnation, in other words, died reincarnated into the cycle, or something that you have not always understood in your society, is that individuals can literally reincarnate in the way that you create that structure, and as we have earlier explained it actually exists, from planetary society to planetary society. So though a majority of you in that sense will seem to have incarnated quote unquote together over the millennium, but also find other individuals incarnating into your cycle for that experience. What caused the end of life on Mars, or is there still life on Mars? There was what you would consider to be a celestial event that did, perhaps you can say result, in what you would call the diminution of their atmosphere. Perhaps, perhaps, in August of this year when your Mars probe shall in that sense, perhaps probe a particular area of interest, you will find beyond the shadow of a doubt some artificial structures upon that scene. I believe they already have photographs of what looks like the shape of a human face. And as well, pyramid or complex is surrounding that area. And again, what you will find is that that area will be refotographed, and the question is will they release the information or not? But it will open many doors in the consciousnesses of many individuals, and it will begin in that sense to solve many ancient mysteries, including that of what you call to be your own pyramid, where there is a relationship. Is there any link between extraterrestrial life and the mysteries of the purview to triangle? Technically speaking, there is a connection. But you may understand that just as your body has energy points, you call chakras. So does your planet have energy points you call vortices? That particular area is a particularly strong vortex, which has a couple of other aspects at play, which we will not now discuss. But again, being that it is within what you call the water rather than over land, there are several unusual effects that can be noted. There are such, again, vortices physically upon what you call land in many areas upon your planet as well, where individuals can enter into this energy and again align and match it if they so should. Without a particular one, we will represent and we will have below it what you call certain ancient remnants of what you generally colloquially refer to as a blackness. And certain of the shall I say material that quote unquote went down, so to speak, actually have a discrete effect on that vortex, making it shall I say a bit unseemly. What caused it last to go down? That was a series of events that culminated in what you would call particular glacial activities that resulted in what you colloquially refer to as the Great Flood. But prior to that there were shall I say other purposely destructive aspects of warfare that did result in minor destructions prior to the major. Okay, just one other question. What about the significance of the craft circles? The craft circles are, again, postcards, so to speak. Now some of them obviously are, as you say, imitations and fake, but there are others that are in that sense genuine. They will represent shall I say a technological slice, perhaps you can say, and the symbols are archetypal. The symbols are not in that sense completely interpretable by analytical means. They do contain what you would call certain mathematical relationships. They do contain what you sometimes refer to as aspects of sacred geometry. But literally the reading of them will also involve what you call the intuition, and will tap into, again, archetypal symbols from your ancient past. For this is not the only age upon your planet that extraterrestrials have interacted with your society. And perhaps in a more open and blatant manner, this has occurred in ancient past. Thank you, ma'am. Over there, ma'am, is there something else? Yes, good evening, Your Honor. As is good evening, Your Honor. I have two questions. One concern is what you opened up before another was a personal question. The personal question has to do with a physical problem, an outbreak on my skin. A physical problem that I experience. What? By the way, to us there is no such thing as a problem, but simply a situation that you have not let transform. Therefore, your situation is what? It transformed itself or seemed to with some coincidentally with the medical care. The doctors could not die. No, sir. I wonder if you have the insights to give me on this as a skin reduction. In general, and again, this is perhaps you can say a generic idea, but a rotation of the skin will represent things that you have here to pour bottled up within you and are refusing to express in any way. So, now plugging that in, what have you recently, having had bottled up recently, been now willing to express? I've been looking at it from that perspective and have not come to the analysis yet, so I'll continue to pursue that. Oh, well again, it made me more obvious than something which requires pursuit. As you begin in that sense in your exploration of what you call healing in your exploration of being of service, what are you recently now able in that sense to convey to individuals with here to pour you would have squelched or squelched? I'm drawing the blank. Oh, simply play around with it. It will be as obvious as you say as the nose on your face. Number two. It was a question that something that you mentioned earlier about the cycles that the earth goes to 25 years cycles. I wonder if you can get more explicit detail of that. Simply it is a description rather than a law of creation of a particular time period that your planet is represented as is expressed by what you call procession. Procession is the wobble of the earth upon its axis, whereby rather than rotating smoothly as you have sometimes imagined, there is actually a wobble, and therefore what you call your north pole will in that sense shift in your sky over what you call approximately a 25,000 year cycle. In this particular presentation of this 25,000 year cycle, what was initiated 25,000 approximately years ago was the idea you call the exclusive exploration of limitation and negativity. Therefore, it is simply again an arbitrary designation or guidelines of a time period through which you have began a cycle, created a momentum, and now as you enter as you say colloquially, although it is still a few years off your age of Aquarius, we'll be ending in that sense, or be ending cycle if you want. That will now represent as this was the age of limitation and separation, the age of integration. Very exciting. How could you force this? Well, you are already within it, so perhaps you are looking in the wrong direction. When we speak of your planet being within a transformation, it is not something that will happen next week. It is something that occurred in approximately your 1987 year, and the blatant geographic, political, and economic evidence is all around you since that year, an event in alignment that was in that sense amplified by members of your society. Sometimes you colloquially refer to it as the harmonic convergence, such then was the beginning, perhaps you can say, of the integrative cycle in no uncertain terms. Therefore now, as a society, you are beginning to embrace ideas that heretofore were simply ridiculous. Godhood was something that was unobtainable, that was only relegated to others, but now you are understanding collectively that you are each the creators of your own reality, and as you begin to entertain this notion on any level as you are opening up to this notion, you then attract the many reflections in your reality that will then allow you to bounce this idea around, that will then reinforce these notions because now you are perceiving. Now is the precipice of the timing through which you can begin to create your life consciously, without all that seeming momentum. You now again will not be running from the old reality, but in walking toward the new reality, simply render the old reality irrelevant. Not get rid of it, again there is nowhere to put it, but you render it irrelevant to the present focus, which is positivity. Again, before we in that sense, it is hard. Understand, in no way, shape or form do we mean when we say negative, and positive, bad, and good. Those are arbitrary terms. When we say negative, we mean separative, limiting. When we say positive, we mean integrative, bringing things back together. Those are the expressions within your reality, positive and negative, and it is not that positive is good and negative is bad. They are both completely equal, diametrically opposed, exploration. The negative energy in being separative actually is one of the energies that allows you to perceive yourself as distinct physical beings. So therefore, while you are physical to some extent, that negative energy, again meaning the separative aspect, will be present to allow you to make the separation between yourself and someone else. So negative is not something to run from, but in walking toward and embracing positivity, integrative action, that negativity again no longer has a hold on you. No longer has an effect. It is simply a fascinating notation in someone else's reality. You can live the life that you prefer. You are in co-creating an interaction with me, opening up in no uncertain terms, whether you find yourself attracted to these ideas and you in that sense engage in them, or whether you never want to have anything to do with me again. You have opened up to ideas which will be of service to you, whether you use them or not. That is in a sense my only job, not to insist that what I am saying is true, but to simply provide an alternative, allow you to make your own decisions and unconditionally love you no matter what. Therefore, if I am doing my job adequately, ultimately I will put myself out of a job, for there will be no other individuals looking anywhere outside of themselves, and then we will simply again share perhaps physically at that point as equal, say, face to face. We thank you for your willingness to co-create this interaction. We thank you for your willingness to share the aspects of yourself that have here to for remained in your own private domain. As you open up you will realize that there is nothing within you that you need run or hide from. They are all ideas and it is not that one is true and another is not true. They are all truths and your masterhood, your choice, your preference now factors into it. It is not this or that. It is this and that which do you choose. It's up to you, you're opening up. We thank you and bid you a most fond and lovely. Good day.
