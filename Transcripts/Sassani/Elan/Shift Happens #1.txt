 All right, I'll say I've been agreeing this day of your time as you create time to exist. Allow me to begin with the idea of discussing what you refer to as change for change in your reality, shifting, changing your point of view is one of the only constants. Even though in that sense you tend to interpret yourself as static beings. You are constantly changing, constantly shifting, and you literally re-express yourself or express yourself anew in each and every moment. Literally, you create yourself 100% in each and every moment, though you attach many definitions from the preceding moment. And so perhaps your own experience would be too in that sense. Feel that you are re-creating yourself in each and every moment. Whichever way you choose to word it, it is basically the same idea. Which is that although you assume yourself to be continuous, although you assume in this continuous flow of how you express yourself, that in that way you change and grow. Most literally you continually re-create yourself, re-express yourself. See that that is a smooth transition because you build into your new definition of yourself many again of the old definitions from what you call the preceding moment or preceding moment. This gives the illusion of continuity. This gives your experience the aparency of being the same being from the moment you are born to the moment as you say you die. Which is also simply a shift in and of itself. And so therefore in beginning to recognize consciously, recognize purposefully that you do indeed shift, change in every given moment instantly. You may understand that, that perception, that understanding, that knowingness enables you in each and every moment to re-create yourself consciously and according to preference. And the act of becoming is more accurately simply the act of being with a certain definition that includes the idea that you are not quite there yet. And so therefore you create yourself in a moment with the aparency that there is somewhere to go, something to obtain, something to become that you are not already. But ultimately in order to go anywhere be anything or become something you make a decision in a given moment that you are already that being. And so the aparency of becoming is simply to make a decision about yourself in a given moment that assumes that you are not already that which you desire. And many times you will even play the game of a gradient where you are that much closer to being that person but still not quite. At some point, at some moment no matter what your criteria is for allowing yourself to make that definitive decision you will eventually say alright alright I've struggled, I've fought, I've worked, I've earned this change, now I am this person. What we share with you is the understanding that it is not the long process that allowed you to become this person, it was you in the moment that you finally decided I am that person that actually creates the change and not any process. Very literally a process is one way to look at it and excuse for not quite being that way yet. And it is absolutely a valid approach in expressing yourself along a gradient and expressing yourself as perhaps seeming lacking and slowly accumulating till you finally will allow yourself to believe you are abundant. But it is not the external reflection of abundance that actually allows you to make that decision. First the decision comes in consciousness. For physical reality is an expression, a mirrored reflection of consciousness and so therefore consciousness is cause. Consciousness is first cause in that case and one other way to word this and your vernacular is simply believing is seeing. As we have said many times, all truths are true and the ultimate truth is simply the idea that all truths are true and valid for those individuals that are exploring them at any given moment. So you may understand in that sense that you always contain every belief and it's reciprocal and the belief you are expressing is in that sense the belief that allows you to get back a result. And so therefore if there are beliefs that you are expressing that are disempowered and perhaps you are using them as an excuse to not shift yourself to your preferred self. I'm going to stand in no uncertain terms that you also contain the opposite belief and it is not a matter of having one belief at the cost of another or having a belief and having to get another belief. It is a matter of containing both beliefs and predominantly expressing one in action. Acting as a person with that belief is another way to look at how you are expressing your belief. And so therefore any belief that exists within you also contains the equal and opposite belief and gives you free reign to choose who you are for you contain all beliefs. If you are willing to begin to express yourself consciously, purposefully, decisively, you may actually gauge your response, gauge your actions to reflect the beliefs you prefer and this gives you the effect of those beliefs being predominant, those beliefs carrying weight. Therefore when you believe that you are a continuous being, the very same being you were a moment ago with one little change your complete experience is that idea, being a continuous being, a slightly changed being in each moment, slightly evolving and that is true because you create it as your underlying foundational assumption about yourself. Though it is also true that you recreate yourself in each and every moment, both of these ideas are equally valid. The idea is that you will express one or the other, expressing yourself as a continuous being that needs to take elaborate steps to affect self-change also has the desired result that many of you say you desire though it takes more time. Understanding the idea that you recreate yourself in each and every moment and being decisive about who you choose to be in a given moment removes that time factor, removes the idea of becoming something you are not and simply allows you to express yourself anew according to preference. So shift change is constant. When you shift your point of view, when you shift your approach, your reality immediately transforms 100% across the board. It is then up to you to look for the evidence to support the fact that the reality has indeed changed though because all truths are true, you can also look for as you say evidence that there has been no change. And the idea is that perhaps you can say ultimately both are true. There is a change and there isn't a change and you get to choose which reality you will experience. And so therefore should you choose to accept that change is complete and begin to express yourself understanding that when you restate who you are, when you put out or assert who you are, that decision registers 100%. And in understanding that it registers 100% be willing to act as though the change has occurred no matter what the apparent is, then your external circumstances will seem to support the change rather than support the old approach. And it is simply a matter in understanding that you wish to shift, to be willing to shift consciously your point of view and your approach to be more conducive toward creating the life you say you prefer. Now we are not saying in any way that one way of expressing yourself is any better than another. One you may find more joy and fulfillment in, but always that you can express yourself are equally valid. And we make this point to simply illustrate that when you understand that all ideas are equally valid with equal weight, then your ability to choose from any option in the infinite potential that you contain becomes effortless because there is no one choice, no one idea that carries any more weight. Simply each idea is a different expression, a different option with a different set of circumstances that can play out. And so therefore you really have it all at your disposal. And paradoxically you always use the mechanisms we are describing anyway. So should you choose not to use them consciously, you still use them. In each and every moment. You still, whether you are speaking to yourself in your mind, thinking out loud or simply automatically doing this, you still decide this is who I am. You still trust that decision, you then perform a series of actions that in a sense is an outward expression, the proof in a sense that you do indeed trust the decision you have made and that your actions are therefore consistent with that decision. So therefore it is up to you to understand that shifting and changing is the rule, not the exception and that perhaps were you to ascribe something as being quite difficult or laborious, it would be the idea of remaining the same, the idea of being static and unchanging. That is effortful, that does not hold up very long because you constantly in that sense are expanding your point of view and therefore shifting your perspective to literally include more of yourself. For I remind you fundamentally you are infinite consciousness and therefore what you refer to as the transparency of growth and evolution is simply your expanding awareness to include more of yourself that already exists and either way you choose to look at it, you still get the effect of seeming to grow, seeming to change but from your infinite perspective you already contain it all. So it is simply a matter of choosing to have certain experiences, choosing to play out certain in that sense, circumstance, not because you need to, not because it is necessary for your growth or you are fundamentally infinite to begin with but because as you say about climbing what you call your mountain because it is there and because experience is available as an option that is in and of itself a valid enough reason to choose to dive into experience simply because it is there, it is an option and whatever it is you wish to sample as you express yourself as consciousness and in this sense as physical beings will be at your disposal to sample in that sense. For you always shift, it always happens and it is now up to you to decide whether you would like that to be random or whether you would like that to be a purposeful statement of who you know yourself in your heart of arts to be using the criteria of the vibration of excitement, the vibration of something that moves you can help you in each and every moment from whatever is available to see which option stands out resonates with who you know yourself to be most strongly and this is why we suggest the use of the idea of excitement to discern from whatever is available what is it that is truly most representative of who you are and your ability to act on a choice with integrity if that choice is available to act on with integrity allows you to express yourself 100% in no uncertain terms purposeful utilizing the feedback system you have set up for yourself as a being and when you function within integrity which is simply the recognition that everything is an integrated whole everything is an expression from you of you and treating it with that respect that that particular understanding brings then that also allows you to know that only can the results of such actions be positive and only can the results of such actions assist both yourself and those that you attract around you to quote unquote co-create the experience of sharing a common reality which is in many ways a misnomer but very much an appearance that you create therefore in allowing me to simply reflect back to you what you already know and in that sense what you perhaps are now ready to expand your own understanding to contain I thank you I thank you for allowing me to act as a mirror and not in any way a giver of information that you do not already have for a mirror can only shine back to you the brilliance that you first contain and so therefore any recognition that you find any recognition that you discover that is most joyous inspiring and helpful to you is already something that you contain to begin with otherwise you would not make intelligible sense out of it what I am saying is your ability to appreciate and understand something is telling you in no uncertain terms that you already contain it and it is simply resonating with who you know yourself to be this is why you find it most desirable it has been the fashion to ascribe the source of such knowledge and the credit for such knowledge to external sources but any any any external source is simply truly a reflection from you to you and so therefore you deserve the credit your ability to perceive it understand it appreciate it and use it tells you it's already within you and now perhaps if it has not been your approach up till now you are willing to entertain the idea of more of yourself and this is cause for celebration for as you begin to revel in who you are you will continue to expand you will continue to grow you will continue to have the aparency of growth and change and allow yourself to consciously sample that which is available in your reality rather than feel like a victim at the whims of the same reality all the time using the very same mechanism of deciding to be the victim I am the victim regardless of whether you say I decided simply because you choose to or you say I decided because of an external set of evidence at some point along the process you decide I am the victim things happen to me then you trust and maintain that decision well look at how everyone is interacting with me I'm the victim everyone then gets to perpetrate upon me and your actions can only reflect either blatantly or suddenly the foundational understanding that you are perceiving yourself as victim and therefore your actions reinforce yourself as victim or as whatever it is your definition is of yourself but similarly it is a decision and if you are willing as you say to take the bull by the horns and have that decision be conscious I assume you would prefer not to be the victim to be the complete integrated entity in your reality who understands that things do not happen to you they happen from you they happen of you and when you begin to make that decision trust that decision act with that foundation you begin to see the results of that as well and so therefore again this is simply how you already create and we are simply discussing shifting consciously changing consciously if indeed you feel a change is necessary at all perhaps some of you do not also anything that you quote unquote seem to become or grow into is literally no better in quality than anything that you have already been perhaps it is more or less integrated more or less positive but in terms of quality every expression of yourself as consciousness has an equal quality brings along with it again something that you put out something that you get back all allows you to reflect to yourself if your approach is negative then what you get back will have the appearance of being predominantly negative if your approach is positive and you put out positive only can you get back positive and you interpret things through the eyes of that positivity simply because both exist it is not that negative or positive one is stronger than the other it is that both exist as equal choices with equal results from putting out from that perspective and what you call the positive approach seems to bring back the results that most of you say you prefer and so therefore understanding that when you change you are not better than you were anything that you were allowed you to find where you're at and it is all one equal expression when you are willing to cease judging yourself for what you have been you will allow yourself to revel in what you are more fully and also appreciate the way that you have orchestrated yourself from perhaps what you call relatively speaking unconscious creation to conscious creation of your life and experience at this timing we will in that sense open this interaction for what you call the exchange the sharing I thank you once again for allowing me to communicate with you in this fashion in this way and understand that we to benefit from these interactions greatly and appreciate your willingness to co-create these interactions with us is this primarily a telepathic interaction my grandson has a request of you all what he has many pets and the other day we were writing in the car and he said grandma there's something I really like to have live with us and I said what is that and he said I'd like to have a baby extraterrestrial so I said the next time I speak to a lawn I'll ask him how you could achieve this well all right consider that your order has been placed although I cannot guarantee what you call delivery time one moment to expand upon this idea it is never has never been and never will be our approach to interfere with a society for we understand you add each sovereign creators and their floor our particular approach is to facilitate to participate by invitation but in that sense never to do anything that might be considered interference for that is the ultimate disrespect for you as sovereign being allowing you to make your own decisions and live the fruits if that's how you choose to create them of your decisions is the ultimate sign of respect and so therefore this is why you may hear very often about extraterrestrials what you call unidentified craft and so forth but there has not been what you call face to face mass interactions this is out of respect for your personal and collective timing and though from time to time any individuals may come forth and say on this day on that day we will interact we will land here we will land there no such decision is etched in stone and would be a disservice at this point in scheduling something in such a way in that the opportunity for us to interact face to face remains contingent on decisions that you constantly make and so therefore in honoring your sovereignty we hold back our timing until the interaction the meeting between us will achieve a meeting of equals sharing as equals and does not take upon the nuance that we will do anything for you for again that would be disrespecting you at sovereign being sensing what you call the energy that is available at present right now which shifts and changes as I have said and so therefore the idea of prediction is simply a sense that can shift as you say on a dime the most likely time frame for face to face interactions with your civilization and what you call an extraterrestrial civilization not necessarily our own by the way is approximately five to ten of your years and so therefore should things continue on a similar wavelength a similar approach as they are now that is the relative time frame that can in that sense shift as you say rather quickly depending upon your personal decisions and your personal action so I simply say this to give you an idea to perhaps understand that although there are what you call from time to time certain face to face interactions with individuals upon your planet on that in that sense there are what you call quite a few years to go in that sense again up to you and your timing and so therefore your request for what you perhaps would call a cosmic foreign exchange student may be a while in the coming but this is not because we do not appreciate you this is not because in any way we feel that you are not good enough to interact with us it is simply honoring your decision and your sovereignty does that help yeah shut up my greetings and you're the net where are you at this moment I am upon my craft you circling our planet I am what you say in your solar system not circling your planet at present it seems like you never come to us from being on the surface of your planet why is that primarily I will function in communicating with you from my spacecraft primarily there has been one or two exceptions in the course of these channels what percentage of your total time would you spend on your planet a year's time that is a fluctuating and changing figure there will be times where I am very closely associated with activities upon my planet there will be other times at which I am as you say out and about several short questions which have to do with your culture on your planet of estasani which I do not believe have been asked before oh what do proceed number one when one of your female becomes becomes pregnant about how long is it before she gives birth to a baby this can fluctuate particularly now that what you call the act of procreation has shifted in our society to be more of an energetic exchange but perhaps you will understand relatively speaking approximately seven months approximately in your time frame and is that birth process painful to the mother and why not absolutely not at all and that is because our understanding of what you call the participation of what you call the unborn child which to us is simply a fully matured and formed soul if you will coming around again so to speak and the idea is that there is assistance from both ends there is a synchronicity a synchronization of intentions that allows for a painless process how does the baby you can do this as well by the way do proceed how does the baby or not you personal I'm glad to hear that how does the baby or child become educated you have schools well do understand as we have discussed many times that we are primarily telling traffic and the idea is in that sense though there still may be some of the idea of what you would call certain orientation that that communication is established what you call prior to conception while the individual is what you call within the womb and upon birth there is already continued communication and familiarity so it is a bit different in that we establish a communication what you call early on in the process there are again certain ideas that will allow individuals once they are as you say able to move about to attract themselves to just the proper individuals that will allow them to learn more about the ideas about the things about the activities that they are most excited about and so therefore our society functions that when an individual comes forth and request something from another individual it is fully given in the understanding that it is no accident and that it is part of the process so from your perspective it would all be quite fluid quite automatic not forced in that sense at all quite serendipitous well then when the baby is born is it fourth density already that is how we express our consciousness and so therefore already it does not perceive itself in the same limited terms that you have perhaps you can say been taught to perceive yourself into in the past how long before the baby can stand up and walk on its own this will vary from what you call mere several months to possibly about a year of your time but again this can vary let me quickly switch and then I'll be there can you say something about your planet's geography such as do you have oceans and what percent of you what percent of your surface is covered by ocean approximately what you call and again this is fluctuating as well 78 percent of our planet will be covered by water but this will also include what you call lakes and rivers as well as oceans somewhat similar to us somewhat but your planet is what's somewhat smaller hey you have mountains and deserts and forests not so much that idea though there are some exceptions we also have what you call no tides for we have no more the rain and storms from time to time how do you handle pollution the idea of pollution was never incorporated into our mentality and approach and so therefore our particular way of expressing our technology has always first and foremost been mindful of the idea of cooperating with the environment and not against one last question we did describe your homes on the planet again we do not generally have what you call specialized structures but there is the idea that perhaps you would refer to as a dough this dome is made of what you would call crystalline structure which is grown on an energy matrix this allows for what you would perhaps consider though it is not accurate the machinery of the actual crystalline structure to be combined into the matrix crystalline framework of the dome itself to make what you call a long story short the idea is that when you are within these particular structures they are completely attuned to your own mentality and so therefore there is no button pushing as you say to be done unless of course for some reason we desire to create that idea and our mentality can as you say illuminate the domicile make the walls what you call transparent or opaque and have what you call different forms of perhaps in your vernacular furniture would be necessary to simply exude itself from the structure spontaneously and then in that sense withdraw itself into the crystalline structure the crystalline matrix of the structure itself does this translate at all yes it does do you have a bathtub or a shower not so much but the idea is that we do enjoy what you call swimming and from time to time will in that sense wait in water for various reasons okay thank you very much oh thank you kidding hey so do you have no more can you talk about your slime water slants well we have what you call one single sun and add advantage that you have that you get that source of energy around our planet in that sense does what you call revolve around its axis so we do experience what you call day and night but understand also that we in that sense do spend what you call much of our time in what you call outer space and so therefore depending upon where we position our crafts we can have what you would call consistent access to our solar body the idea is that we do not rely on what you would call solar energy for what you call energy congratulations see how easy that is I understand the concept of making decisions on is there in our linear way of thinking I don't know if I can work this right but is there an advantage to working on a subconscious level as far as making a shift if you wish to maintain the idea of a subconscious influence but the idea by definition is that that is information that you are by the way consciously ironically placing out of your conscious awareness and the idea is by beginning to be willing to have it be conscious subconscious becomes in that sense irrelevant still existing if you need to use it feel pragmatically useful in certain automatic shall I say behavior that you exhibit one for instance would be the idea you call driving or performing some repetitive task but no longer being used as an excuse to play a shell game with your own consciousness and your own intention I have done nothing thank you sharing concerning the human library card experience could you tell us something about that and define what you mean by those terms in the living library that we can somehow function as a library card well the idea is that that is one way to look at it that you are a library card or have access to an external library but in that sense when you are willing to expand your thinking to understand that reality exists within you and not the other way around the logic of conclusion is that you are the library and understanding that the library exists within you and not the other way around perhaps in that sense gives you backdoor access so that you no longer need a card do you understand the distinction is there something you find that is not desirable about this idea no are you willing to in that sense entertain the possibility that it can be that simple or would you prefer to create an elaborate process to access that which you already are then the idea is to begin to entertain the idea that what you formally assumed to be something to get to something to access already lies within you and therefore your access is automatic and your willingness to trust what you get when you ask questions that you don't think you know the answers to and use what you get to the best of your ability increases your ability to access the library by trusting and using what you already get simply to put it on a useful level is that of assistance thank you I thank you as well Jenny the people of our planet expand our consciousness here on planet earth will that also allow us will we also get another color that we will be able to view as our consciousness expands on this planet in many ways yes and in many ways you will find as you begin to expand yourself consciously as a consciousness that the very fine physical bandwidth of perception that you have even in physical terms will increase in other words you will begin to see like in a wider spectrum you will begin to hear things which formerly were out of your range you will begin to sense things with all of the idea of your senses more intensely more brilliantly and what you call the colors you already perceived will seem to be that much more alive will stand out as being that much more visit and that perceptual change always without exception first begins with it begins with entertaining the idea that you are a whole being entertaining the idea that you are expanding into more of yourself entertaining the idea that in that expansion you will begin to see new things and beginning to notice when you do is there something that has occurred to you recently that has caused the asking of this question well yes colors do seem to be more vivid to me and a lot of natural colors we have sunsets and I seem to notice a lot more brilliance of colors absolutely and this will continue to expand and do understand it is literally your willingness to express more of yourself consciously to appreciate your reality congratulations thank you a lot one more question about color do you do your people experience more than seven colors generally that we have here on our planet do you also have a seven color planet or more than that we can in that sense experience the same bandwidth as you but we also have the ability in that sense to perceive things on more of an expanded level thank you as well I thought of me. I was out of the dream I was aware. Oh, and I dropped vivid dreaming, personally. I'd say it was vivid. Anyways, it was about this lady that came into my dream, and she gave me a pennant of a dog. And then the spire came all around me, and then the dog appeared, and it was one of those Egyptian nugs, those maneuvers, and the dream and those ladies and everything. So at the end of the dream, I was laying in my bed, and I could see in the dog, and I could spare it kind of going around the bed. It was kind of cool. So the next day I woke up, and I had a nice day. I loved it. I loved it. I loved it. I loved it. So the next day, I was so intrigued, and some of the healings, I noticed that the dog was coming in in a fair form. So I really wanted to get the dog. So I called the vet, and I said, can you tell me where I can find these dogs? So I found a lady that actually had a dog. So I went up to meet her. And when I met her, it was really fascinating, because she had the pennant on that I saw in the dream. Oh my. And I felt like I knew the people. And I saw the dog. I met the dog. And I told her about the dream, and ironically, not ironically, she was very open to the understanding of metaphysics and spirituality. And I wanted the dog, because I really wanted the dog to come into my life. But I stopped short of me and I was testing the dogs. And perhaps visitation. Right. The idea is simply this. Generally speaking, and these are generalizations for things are as specific to individuals as they interpret them. But the symbol of the dog is the symbol of service. More foundationally, more fundamentally, this is at the core of your willingness to now be of service to yourself and others, but yourself as well. And so therefore, the physical symbol itself is not as necessary, though you can create what you call a relationship with it. Okay. I guess I was kind of beating myself up just like I had to dream and I found the dog. I mean, I felt like I found the actual dog. And the lady, it was like the lady knew me and she was part of the dream and it was really quite interesting. Oh. Keep your eyes open. And you will find something along these lines. Allow it to be natural and have its own timing. Oh. And who you as well. All right. How about another one? Yeah. Prosy. Your counterpart. All right. Prosy. Could you tell me what that means in your language? In my language, it would roughly translate to the idea of dancing the light. Oh, thank you. We think so, yes. Can I have your children? Personally, no. I know some. Have you been here on the Earth before living with Anya? In the form that you understand me to be a now-no. In fact, in the form that I am in now, I have never set foot, physical foot upon your planet, though I have in that sense. Flown by it, gotten close, made certain visual sightings, and perhaps wheel set foot upon your planet soon. So in the time of each of the way that I like, I'm going to use the... Our involvement with your planet in this way is relatively recent. I thank you as well. Shitting. Hey. You got the condition of my system. There are again very many different expressions of that idea. The one we generally will express is the idea that such individuals have chosen to be highly specialized, highly focused in physical reality from your perspective, or from the perspective that one would judge that particular decision, it would seem as though that focus or specialization is at the cost of the rest of what you perhaps refer to as social custom. And so therefore the idea is not so much that these individuals are not genius. They are in that way genius specialized focus. The challenge is to find how they express that focus. When you do, you will see them suddenly wake up and shine in that area generally only. Because it is at the cost of the rest of the quote unquote agreed upon perception of reality, these individuals can very strongly commit to being very genius and focused in one area. That is the reason. What area is my private or specialized... That is up to you to decide. And you will find if you are willing to see the types of things that he gravitates toward and provide them consciously, you will begin to see again the way that he can shine. Rather than assuming that something is wrong, assume that you would behoove yourself to find the thing that is right for him. And it will be patently as you say, obvious. For again, when you present the individual with something that is in any way representative of their chosen focus, they will light up. They will react in ways you have not seen them react. They will act with unknowingness and a preconceived knowledge that will in that sense surprise and shock you. Have you sampled different ideas or is this all quite new? No, I think we need this. Do I have it on? Oh, well, you will again see that he or she will have a tendency to have their attention gathered by someone. Have you in that sense played what you call ball with your son? Explained. Rolling a ball. That's his favorite thing right now. Oh, yeah. Play with that. You may find that he will begin to do things with the ball that are in that sense quite amazing. He has a place to start. Thank you. I've done nothing. Shut it. Hello. Hey. Hi. The boy tells me. I'm going to go and stand around and I'm doing a proxy, actually. He has moved to India and I'd like to know if you have any words for her for something here to take. Happy trails. Understand that reality moves around you and so therefore she has gone nowhere. And understand as well that there is in that sense things to be done where she is that will be quite conducive to the overall transformation, both individually and collectively in that area. Will that define you? I believe so. Oh, is that all? Now, now. Aww. It's not a really saying you know, well, you know, we're actively playing with and having a lot of fun with the book. You have any comments on that? Right on. With that R-I-G-H-T or W-R-I-T-E-I. Ah, infinite potential. Up to you. Exactly. The idea is, any way that any of you chooses to express yourself in empowered terms can only add the, what you call momentum, the, what you call influence, if you will, understanding these terms loosely of empowerment, of transformation. And so any way that you are so moved to express the transformation, by all means, will be conducive at least for yourself, if not for many others as well, which often will be the case. So when in that sense we speak about finding the things that excite you and acting upon them with integrity, this would apply to any project that you have as well. And your criteria of using your excitement even in the project, understanding paradoxically that when you're not excited about the project, it is time to temporarily do something else. The excitement will come back when the timing is, in that sense, most conducive, can allow the process in and of itself to be a joyful reflection, a joyful expression, and not, as you say, glorious and effortful. Therefore, in that sense, let excitement be your guide, and let your guide be your excitement. That's what we've been doing, and it just floats all effort from place. I'm thrilled. From my perspective, in the way that we orchestrate information you are doing just fine. Great. I didn't listen to that. Right? Shooting. Hey. It's my first time speaking with you. It's my first time as well. It's my pleasure. I have a question. Oh, I am. Working with the idea that as children on the planet, if they're perhaps unconsciously creating their own experience, or not conscious that that is how we're functioning here, why do violent things occur to children, perhaps with adults, but I'm not understanding how experiences can come about if there's an innocent begin with. I understood, but do understand that you are, in that sense, multi-dimensional, infinite, and eternal beings. And what you call life is one of an infinite number of lives that you have led. So in that sense, from the perspective of linear reality, there is the transparency of innocence and freshness and newness. From the perspective of yourself as an infinite soul, there is in that sense a preexisting consciousness that accompanies what you call an incarnation. The idea that you refer to society as karma, by the way, in the way that you choose to express it, perhaps unknowingly, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, is self-imposed. The idea of balance is automatic. When you put out something, you get something back immediately. You always get the reality you are the vibrational. But needing to experience that balance in such what you call tit-for-tat terms is a societal and individual choice. And so therefore, when individuals strongly buy into what you call karma, very often that will be the explanation for those types of setups. Another idea is that individuals who are in that sense what you call infant, child, are very receptive and very able in that sense to mimic the vibration, to sympathetically vibrate to those around them. So often in that sense it can also be a function of co-creating a life, a reality, a situation, a circumstance with those parents and what those parents are creating as well. But the idea is that you can begin in any moment in realizing who you are consciously to have things from this moment forward or the moment forward from making that decision be more of a conscious result and less of the idea of coming from quote unquote karma and from what you call path tendencies. Does that answer the question? Yes. It says children then are, or you're coming from a premise that we are being incarnated from another form. Well, the idea is that you live many lives in many different realities, but you live a series of many, many, many consecutive lives upon your planet as well. And so therefore what you are calling an innocent child was in the not too distant path, a fully formed grown up, died as you say reincarnated. That is not my exact understanding of the mechanism, but I understand in linear terms reincarnated will do as an explanation. That helps. Thank you. Now that is in no way to rationalize such behavior. The perpetrator in a victim perpetrator situation still has full responsibilities for their action and will create full results which generally seem to manifest themselves in what you call consequences for these types of actions. The other individuals, the children who may play in that sense victim can choose to use that victimhood as an excuse to continue to perpetrate other things on other individuals in what you call their future or in that sense can function as a very strong reflection of an unwillingness to tolerate that type of perpetrator hood and in that sense refuse to be the victim. There is opportunity in that sense for many types of experience which can be used in a positive way, though they are inherently seem to be negative results. And you will find many of your most motivated grownups in making great change upon your planet have done so using those very victim situations as a motivation. So there is an example of how such a thing which would seem on the surface who have absolutely no positive value would actually have a great value for many, many, many, many individuals. Does that help? Yes. Thank you. Thank you. I have a very dear friend who had a real tragic situation happen to one of the children. And I have such and her many times and find that when, oftentimes when I am speaking about these things that you have nearer to us to her, I get a flash of the situation and somehow I can't make the connection directly to it because it is so tragic. And there is still. It has to do with her husband without realizing it in her stroke, backed over her son, when he was three and she'll tell him. And so I really, are you saying that that child incarnated knowing perhaps that that sort of thing or? In that type of instance it can be the situation where the individual is in that sense conscious. There are instances where they would not be and instances where they would. But at this point all that can be had from the situation is using it as either a negative reflection or a positive reflection. You think the parents an opportunity to exercise forgiveness and that sort of thing? Perhaps as you say, a very large bowl of wax, but yes. Does allow them to look at many issues of unconditional loves, health love, forgiveness, judgment. You know, I think our children, you know, they are just and they don't really belong to us because. Well also understanding that the individual, the child, does not cease to exist simply is in that form no longer physical. And that in a sense can be very helpful to understand in maintaining a more balanced perspective in understanding you are all infinite beings as well. It is challenging for the parents to understand that. But nothing like that. I would imagine that it would be. And this is an example of something which I would have no personal experience with. At this timing allow us to pause for what you call a break and resume contact after that timing.
