 I see some great potential and I just want to see it develop. I feel exactly the same way. What can we do? Questioning. I can answer. Okay. We can allow the process to be perpetuated and disseminated to each of you. For in practice we get the scientific information and present itself. For channeling is a old science of sorts but newly activated and it is in practice, genius emerges. You may throw seeds upon the earth and some will not come to fruition. The more seeds you throw, the more possibility of flowers. Of those flowers, many are beautiful. Beauty, however, is in the eyes of the beholder. The sign of the omic, which decorates the top of the sarcosic is the sign of life. It is in reality a mirror. You may see it displayed thus. The mirror is purposely placed in the sign of life to represent your ability to reflect and to transmit. The more you reflect and transmit, the less the veil of forgetfulness. And so what we can each do is allow the energy that we naturally channel as daughter of Pharaoh to shine. And that is my answer to you. My answer is proof of fact or two different things. No, for the most part, most of you assume the truth is fact. And what you have to understand when you are dealing with a channeling situation is that you are dealing with an emotional body or emotional vehicle of physical flesh that interprets an energy to the best against capable and its ability. The truth is a resonance. Everybody's truth is different. The facts might be facts, but everybody's truth about those facts is something different. And so your biggest problem is that you are working with an emotional vehicle, a body. And so as a feeling or energy comes into that body for translation and interpretation, the pictures are going to be drawn from the emotions of the vehicle and that has to paint a picture that as far as that vehicle is concerned, that is true. Because they are interpreting and painting a picture holographically for what they feel. And so the feeling is deep and so forth. The interpretation of that becomes their truth. The facts are another thing. The facts because everybody's truth changes the facts. For example, your president, your candidate, nobody's going to survive that type of bullet wound to the head. He's dead. Facts. True to many people, as he would live on some island, he was vegetable. It was his twin. It was somebody else. Look at your truth and facts about Elvis Presley. He's in some place down there and some mistake nobody knows. He's dead. True is relative to the individual. And that is why you're going to have a difficult time when you work with a physical body of a channel because what comes up for interpretation is going to have to be true according to their emotional body of knowledge. And it may be void of fact. Therefore, in most cases, childs are best used for emotional truths and their pursuit and stimulation of helping you create your own emotional truth. And the facts are not always going to be there and they're not always going to be accurate. Thank you. Well done. I would like to ask you a further question. How do I feel about accessing the way it sounds? I don't really have any problem with it. I'm very comfortable with it. I'm mostly associated with Susan and I have studied other channels. I just know that I have glimpsed a genius that I want to see developed and come forth. And it's been very exciting to me. How do you like to see it in relation to you? It doesn't have to come through me. I can try and develop it that way. It's not necessary for me to. I'd rather understand the channeling process enough to contribute in a positive way to any channeling experience to bring that forward. So it doesn't have to be me. It's not sound. I'm not looking for personal validation from the process. I've glanced at that sometimes even, of channeling is for some kind of cheat or Idaho. It's tagged as random maybe technologies? I'm describe it as a human accident for us. Why does a person of steel get it up to you? Because what I understand is most often identify in my mind based on customization. I think geared forward a hundred percent into everything in my mind. frustration that I mean I think it's really a helping thing. You want Ston just know how to use the mind? Yes and my question is why not use your mind? Well I think I am. I'm not looking for an entity to come through and tell me everything's okay and I'm great have a nice day. I want to understand the that there's some genius in all of you here and I want to understand why is it there how can it be used? How can we improve? The way that you will understand it openly is through tapping into the genius that is present to you. Oh it's lovely. Yes. But it's nice that a little. Whatever the vehicle is that gets you there is perfect. Yes whatever the vehicle is perfect. Yes. Cool. Thank you. Thank you. Good question. I have a question. Okay. You use the term universe. You know I heard you refer to the multi-mercy. Could you explain that and also the defibrillation of multi-dimensional? I need some clarification on term. I don't come to terms with your term. You have all forms of universals. You can say your body is a universe. You have universals within universals within universals. So it depends. Everybody's metaphors going to be different. One person's going to say dimensions. One person's going to say frequencies. Look at it as universe is big. A universe means that a set of things that are also working, moving, functioning inside of it. And so everybody you talk to is going to have different terminology on that universe. The universe is a different way to do all that for a reason. Is that the only universe? No. That is the only universe you will perceive while vibrating at the level of that universe. But because as you change your vibration, your experience and perception of what you call universe changes entirely, we utilize the terminology multi-verse. But again, this is all quite linguistic and arbitrary. Yeah. One more question is about the pyramid. We're going to touch the one there tomorrow. And we're going to have this great event inside the pyramid. What does it mean to have that? What is it? It means send out. It's more than that if you send out or that the method can be the pyramid, we're going to touch the one there tomorrow. And we're going to have this great event inside the pyramid. What does it mean to have that? What is it? It means send out. So if you click in it, it's more than that if you send out or that the method can be the pyramid, we're going to touch the one there tomorrow. And we're going to have this great event inside the pyramid. What does it mean to have that? What is it? It means send out. So if you click in it, it's more than that if you send out or that the method can be the method to be the pyramid. We're going to touch the one there tomorrow. And we're going to have this great event inside the pyramid. What does it mean to have that? What is it? It means send out. So if you click in it, it's more than that if you send out or that the method can be the method to be the solution. What is it? I have just demonstrated that I absolutely have. By creating new event. I'm looking at it to reflect it by energy from the pyramid. And we're going to be putting hands on the pyramid. We're going to have a ceremony to decide in this chamber. Maybe I just don't know why we're doing all that. Maybe. I picture going in there and sending out a method. Then go right ahead. If you're sensitive, you can send, you can receive, you are a transceiver and both enemies. But the message is that you are sending, you are sending to yourself, the message is that you are receiving. You are receiving to yourself. It is both, you are the universe. Physicality exists within you and not the other way around. So you can word it, play with it any way you wish. It is all one thing. Do you prefer breathing in or breathing out? Both are completely silent. Good enough. Can you conceive of entities who can conceive of you sending a message? Oh. You have great sweetness in asking the question. And it was as though we had a wondrous joy, contemplating that you would be sending a message. And then, decided a little later that the message might not have anywhere to go. That's the answer. Yes. Yes. Yes. We are sending a message. The message is out there. The message I like to send out there is two. The message is to be the outer strategy. And the energy that is coming in so we can reflect the sounds to our thoughts. Yes. What is the message? Unconditional love. Let's take it now. Everybody, stand up. Come on. Stand up. Yes. It will be specific receiving. Are you ready? Yes. Everybody take a deep breath. Let it out. Close your eye. And focus your energy right into the heart. Reading in and out of your heart center. And feel the love that lives in your very own heart. And you might perhaps notice that there is a heart next to you and another. And collectively, we feel quite a heart space here. And you might perhaps send your hands up first so that through the palms you might radiate that heart energy. And send it as white light anywhere you choose. No. If you are very desired to return to the source, it is the act of giving the energy. And you are doing well. Thank you. Thank you. Before we ask you to be very still for our channels to come out of transit, let's show them how much we appreciate it. And now if we could just have a moment or two without moving around, without leaving a tent, and just send your love and clear intention to our channels as they return to this room. You may. Good evening. I love you, too. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
