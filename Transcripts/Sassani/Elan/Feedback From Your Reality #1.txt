 I will not ask you how you are before I know that you are all perfect. A perfect reflection of whatever it is you are exploring in any given moment. Allow me to entitle this interaction if you will feedback from your reality. As we have discussed many times in many forms you are pure consciousness expressing yourself in linear terms, expressing yourself as a physical being, doing so so convincingly you actually believe it. We create it. In doing so there is standardly or shall I say most usually a particular mechanism through which you focus your consciousness that allows you to experience yourself as a physical being seemingly in a physical world having a so-called experience. Understand from our perspective that you are all these things and they actually exist within you but the apparent is that you exist within a reality. In that light you focus your consciousness to express and experience what you call your physical life, your physical experience in each and every moment right now which is truly the only time that exists perhaps you can say in the most fundamental terms. In each and every moment generally in what you consider an automatic scene in fashion you focus your consciousness in a series of steps that then result in your life and your reality in your experience having a certain flavor, a certain meaning, certain parameters if you will. In each and every given moment you decide who you are. That is perhaps you can say step one of the mechanism. Step two is you trust or you invest a consistency in having that decision stick you trust in that decision and again perhaps step three is the idea that you then act which is shall I say your most accepted notion of what creates physically in the physical world your actions as it were. When you decide who you are you automatically create yourself in the moment you are deciding to be that person across the board no matter what and when you change that decision this is why many times your reality seems to fluctuate seems to change but when you make that decision in the moment that you decide you are that person you are being that decision what you choose what your decision is is what you are being what you subsequently trust in and then if you remain focused if you remain conscious about it your actions then reflect that decision and therefore your actions produce an effect that is consistent with that decision in the way that you create your physical life what we would now like to direct if you will your attention to is the idea that your reality although it is you although it actually comes from you as is an expression of you still to some degree can have the apparent of being external to allow for the idea of reflection of knowing of mentality and therefore one of the ways that you can perceive that your reality reflects back to you any idea and any given moment is as feedback in a sense the way we use the term reflection in first that what comes back to you is always reflective representation of what you have put out who you are being who you have decided that you are and so therefore what you perceive as coming back so to speak in the way that you separate out yourself in this way is the feedback from your reality generally speaking as a simplification individuals will interpret the feedback in one of two ways now there are an infinite number of ways that you may actually interpret it but to illustrate the point we will simply narrow it down to two one you trust that the feedback reinforces your decision or two you trust that the feedback negates or shows evidence contrary to your decision how you interpret that feedback ultimately is what allows you to either maintain a preferred desirable decision or seem to allow yourself to be strayed back although that is an illusion to perhaps a more disempowered older decision so it all boils down to your willingness to use whatever you perceive as coming back to you in the form of feedback as a reinforcement as evidence for why your decision has stuck is in fact registered and is who you are and this can take shall I say a bit of persistence a bit of consistency before you actually seem to prove to yourself that all feedback no matter what it appears to be always reinforces your decision if your decision is now conscious in other words rather than randomly allowing circumstances to dictate who you are and then saying well I must be this person you're still making the decision but using the circumstances as your rationale you can allow your decision by trusting that your decision has indeed registered across the board to have the feedback that comes back to you always reinforcing the decision no matter what it looks like now where the ingenuity the creativity and the persistence comes in is your willingness in a moment where feedback would come to you having made a decision to perhaps change to perhaps transform whereby that feedback would appear on the surface to be contrary to your decision at that point you can as you say make or break your decision if it seems to be contrary to your decision you always have the option to simply remind yourself that all those it appears to run contrary your circumstance your experience relationships apply this to anything that it has to be a direct feedback of the positive decision and therefore the aspect that you are noticing about that feedback is not the reason it is there is not the proof of the reinforcement all feedback has the ability to be always interpreted from the entire perspective of ranging all the way from the most negative to the most positive for the situations themselves are fundamentally neutral with no built-in meaning they are a set of props if you will if you attach meaning that is inconsistent with your decision then it can seem to be evidence that your decision simply did not register or that perhaps you do not create your reality but if you choose to look further if you choose to go beyond the surface if you choose to dive into finding how even this particular feedback though it appears contrary has to be supportive of my decision you can begin to look at how the feedback serves you reinforces supports the decision as opposed to how it refuses or how it seems to nullify your decision and always will all situations all feedback contain the ability to either say why is this happening to me or how can this serve me how does this serve me exactly the way it is this will allow you to begin to use everything including the seeming negative evidence to reinforce your decision and to continue to support yourself to fortify the decision itself by being willing to not simply settle for what's on the surface if feedback seems negative and being willing to probe further into how that feedback is not only a reinforcement of your decision but essential to occur in order for you to fully express your decision that particular approach is the approach that allows you to very quickly transform even the appearance of the feedback for when you use all the feedback no matter what it appears to be on the surface to reinforce and support your positive decision then the feedback the nature of the feedback your relationship to the feedback changes and transforms and the result is when you are consistent never allowing the feedback to talk you out of your decision that you will begin to see the nature of the feedback change where the feedback will no longer even seem on the surface to refute your decision will no longer seem on the surface to prove to you that indeed you do not create your own reality and are fooling yourself and so the simple statement how does this serve me exactly the way it is is the beginning toward using all of yourself to express yourself more fully I say the first step because the second step is to truly act as though you really are committed to believing that and take the form listen up of actually appreciating feeling gratification at the feedback for coming in the form that it has allowing you to look at whatever it is it is allowing you to look at to reinforce your decision and when you are willing not facetiously not sarcastically but sincerely and honestly to thank the negative seeming feedback and feel that appreciation feel that gratitude then you are truly expressing in action the idea that you are no longer able to be talked out of who you are by anyone anything any circumstance any relationship period because it is a conscious decision that is generated for you by you and allows you to then express more of yourself another way to look at this is when you are simply willing upon deciding who you are to honor everything that comes your way and use it in a positive way you are literally using more of yourself and another way to put this is you are expressing yourself more fully you are understanding yourself as a creator choosing to create a physical experience which has certain parameters certain seeming limitations in terms of occurring before during after in terms of occurring in a time frame but truly the other limitations that you perceive hold you back from being who you are simply transform for nothing nothing nothing can hold you back from who you are except you and no matter what the reason you may have for finally agreeing I cannot be who I am you ultimately decide it you ultimately make that decision you assume that decision sticks well I can't be who I am you trust I can't be who I am you act like I can't be who I am and then the feedback comes back very blatantly to reinforce well you are wasting your time on the creating your own reality path to begin with and so therefore even then even should you choose the most disempowered path you are using your power you are using this same methodology way of focusing your consciousness and expressing yourself to actually prove to yourself that you have no power and irony however to remind yourself that you always are using that power even when you are expressing it as complete powerlessness can sometimes be the key that will allow you in any given moments to have a chuckle and realign to the idea that no matter what I do I'm going to do this anyway I'm going to decide I'm going to trust I'm going to act so if I have that be a conscious expression then my life will be a conscious state if I am willing to decide consciously then there is no idea of a subconscious that can have any effect on you for ultimately you designate yourself as the decision maker and so even if there were the idea of choices that came your way even if they seem to come from within it is still you the conscious self that decide yes I will buy into that or no I will not and so therefore you the conscious self are always the power the creation the experience the perception of the experience and more literally you as the observer the observed and all together the observer and the observed are one event all you so therefore perhaps you can say you can't really get away from yourself no matter who you talk to where you go what you do for it is all you reflecting back to yourself who you are in seemingly a given isolated moment of time I say seemingly because you also have an infinite expression of consciousness but we will go into that another time therefore the feedback from your reality always reinforces who you are who you have decided to be and if that decision is conscious purposeful and pointed then the feedback has a conscious purposeful and pointed reflection though not always on the surface and sometimes what is on the surface may seem to obscure the actual reinforcement and this is where we simply suggest that you take for granted that nothing is extraneous that everything is part of who you are and there is nothing that is outside or interrupting therefore whatever the circumstances has to contain within it a positive reinforcement that you can use to strengthen your resolve to strengthen your decision your trust and ultimately your action before we proceed to what you call the interaction allow me to also simply reiterate the following when you perceive the feedback from your reality to be negative and then you have an emotional response to that which is generally a negative emotion we have mentioned and suggested that you do not ask until you realign to your positive decision but I would like to reemphasize that by all means it is necessary to allow yourself to have whatever the most natural emotional response is in other words if your emotional response seems to run contrary to your decision allow it to run its course allow yourself to feel that way we have suggested to not act to not respond outwardly but by all means express it to yourself and allow yourself to express it fully for when you do it passes when you don't you have this sense that you are squelching yourself and you have the sense because you are so therefore it is all well and good to notice I am having a negative emotion alright I will have it or I understand I cannot deny anything this is part of my feedback and once I allow myself to have it rather than resist having it the emotion will pass and then I can realign and I will realign consciously not out of denial of the initial response or reaction that you have and so therefore by all means if feedback appears negative feel whatever you feel allowing yourself to feel it will generally have in that sense it resolve itself within what you call but a few of your minutes resisting it saying I shouldn't feel that way anyone who is enlightened does not feel that way will prolong it sometimes for a long time so the idea is you need not act allowing a negative emotion to dictate your outward response which will have an effect but by all means feel the response and do not deny it for the irony is even that negative emotional response are you listening okay even that negative emotional response reinforces the positive decision although there is a nuance of an old approach in there and by allowing yourself to feel it rather than avoiding it which would have been the older approach your reaction your reaction to that emotion will be different and by allowing it to play out and then acting after you have realigned to your decision will have all your actions being a reflection of the decision no matter what your reaction may be to a particular set of feedback and so again another way to put this is you can use it all nothing can talk you out of who you are until you fall perhaps you can say fall into agreement with it but ultimately that agreement is the very decision that we have discussed as the foundational consciousness focusing approach to how you create yourself in each and every given moment always starts with deciding I am this person in this moment whether you say it like that or whether it is automatic that goes on and by having it become conscious and living it to be conscious eventually there will not even be a tendency to need to even say these things to yourself for you will run on automatic and I understand this sounds paradoxical but consciously in other words it will simply be effortful effort less and automatic to maintain your positive decision particularly when you use any negative feedback allow it to transform and start to notice even the feedback is primarily even on the surface positive and that would be in that sense my promise to you if you are willing consistently it must be consistent because of the way you create yourself as a linear being to use all the feedback that comes back to you that you have formally labeled negative to see how it actually reinforces your decision then the nature of the feedback will change and the so-called things that seem negative that you need to relabel and look at will seem to recede in almost entirely disappear in your life will not generally entirely disappear and there is a specific reason for that as well therefore understanding this understanding that everything can be viewed as a reinforcement of your decision though sometimes you need to employ a little ingenuity to see how and why it supports it I thank you thank you for your willingness to continue to interact with me and members of my civilization in this way and thank you for your willingness to stand up tall and decide who you are rather than be dictated to and have your decision be reflective of someone else's idea or perhaps as you say they for there seems to be this generic way that you all think exists that actually is gang enough on you they are not it is simply you and therefore always is it up to you to choose who you are rather than have it be dictated seemingly to you who you are in return for your willingness to share aspects of your consciousness with me I thank you deeply for I get a lot out of these interactions as well and ask you how we may mutually be of service to each other through sharing information now not all in one hey how are you? How are you there? Recently about I say about three weeks ago I had made a decision that's surprising decision to start doing what I'm doing at my work and I found that before you proceed is or was your work bringing you joy and excitement on a consistent basis oh what do you proceed? I was so surprised so after that I made that decision I made another decision to take a proper option to focus on my family and my husband and as someone like now I'm really not knowing what to do but I'm getting a joy and excitement out of doing my medical wheel and really kind of just doing nothing but I'm also trusting and allowing and living in a very different way that whatever comes along I'll just ask and I'm going to enjoy I've never done this before oh well congratulations and welcome to what you generally refer to as the edge but it need not seem to be an edge for it is truly the middle of creation the idea is that if you have no real solid idea of specifically what it is that you are to be doing you can simply have the decision be that you will be happy that you are happy that you are blissful and by living that as the decision then whatever detail needs to come along in what you call a physical way to reinforce that it simply will automatically the idea generally speaking is that many of you do things to be happy and feel if I do this I will get this then I will be happy but if you start out with the idea of your decision incorporating I am happy I am blissful then it almost doesn't really matter what you do for you already have that and anything that you do is a reflection and an expression of that you do this anyway generally you decide societally I am not happy I am not fulfilled I am close but not quite and when I just have this relate with this person do that gain this then I will be happy the paradox being generally you do not allow yourself to have all these things and when you do if you are to you then make the decision in a moment well it is alright to be happy now I have these things and the irony is it is not the things that have made you happy it was in that moment even though you use the things as a rationale you then register that your decision includes the idea of happiness so the apparent is that the things that made you happy but the actuality is that you have decided to be happy and so therefore the decision I am this person can be I am this person that does this particular thing but it can be simply as general as what it is you wish to accomplish what it is is your end goal in how you feel what your experience is and how you feel support and so therefore one of these suggestions that the channel has allowed us to be aware of is the idea of simply choosing bliss excitement and abundance for the idea is if you are already blissful already excited engage motivated inspired and already understand I am supported no matter what I do I always have been no matter if a bill comes in or not then everything that you do winds up being a function or result of bliss excitement and abundance or whatever these parameters are for you so one thing I may suggest is for each and every one of you to ponder whenever you wish what it is you actually will be when you get there whatever there is for you and when you are able to word or phrase or synopsis side what that you will be begin to decide and buy into the qualities that you feel you will gain rather than the process in the details to get there and this saves you a lot of time if you are already blissful then what does it matter what happens what happens is simply an expression of that and if something would seem to run contrary to bliss but you maintain your blissful attitude that artificially but as a conscious decision then the way you interpret everything changes it is far easier from deciding to be blissful to look at feedback in a constructive way in a supportive way so therefore in your instance my suggestion would be to concentrate on what it is you would wind up being if you had a long process and became the person you wish to be and simply now begin to choose not a search not a firm not constantly say it to remind yourself but choose those things now and there is a distinction between affirmation and choice although affirmation can absolutely be used as the statement of choice generally it is not generally it is used as this is who I wish I was this is who I wish I was I know I'm this but this is who I wish I was and maybe if I say it enough I'll believe it now I am not criticizing the idea of affirmation simply saying that when used in that flavor it actually reinforces the very thing that is opposite of what you are affirming when you use it as a choice ah I forgot I choose bliss I choose excitement therefore I can't yell at this person because it's not consistent with that decision you begin to have your actions be reflective of the decision and obviously using that example you yell at someone or you do not you know the response will be completely polar opposite so therefore aligning to your decision and having your decision be the end product of what all of the struggle and transformation and evolution will get you can save you time and you can understand that every moment you haven't been blissful excitement and positively abundant you have been choosing the opposite of these ideas does that make sense oh wow have a good time can I ask a question you just did would you like another yes oh why is it better than that I have like herbs and flowers and all the necessities I've invited the exercise so they can live in the world is there a um plant that you would like to um suggest that I could put into my garden that the irreverence of simply perhaps a tree that you find most enjoy for that is symbolic of the idea of remaining grounded in fact enmeshing yourself as a grounded being while still being willing to branch out and reach toward the heavens symbolically exactly that I'm doing oh right and also functioning as a positive transformer as what you call trees and plants do I have made it a bit unique on the market the association of the world oh right do understand though that the key element is something that you resonate towards something that is exciting to you rather than me saying go plant this particular that would be in the service oh I've done nothing thank yourself shitting hey greetings and we good day if you are you are you flat on your back right now I thank you my what your projection takes hey I see in a horizontal position that would be flat yes although if you wish to get technical perhaps you will say horizontal in relationship to my spacecraft for in space there is shall we say changing relativity I am not horizontal to the surface of my planet necessarily what is the purpose of that protection table simply the utilization of technology for the fun of it or we do not simply need the table somehow I put you in touch to agree how do I say the Apache records is that correct we do not make the separation that there is a set of knowledge out there that is not an expression of who we are so we can use the idea of technology to seem to access things but we understand foundationally this is who we are but if you go back to your home planet somewhere there you have access to additional information of the whole universe there are places that we may go that could be perhaps referred to as meditative area this is very loose our approach is far different from your own but this will do as an analogy but this does not give us so much access to anything that we don't normally or naturally have access to as much as solitude by the way what you refer to as Akashic records it's simply you all knowledge all wisdom all consciousness exists within you when you decide when you assume and decide by an assumption that it is out there then you create the need to get to it as though it is separate from you but you need not look at it that way and were you too wish to access more of yourself my first suggestion would be to stop referring to it as an external thing record doubt either with the fancy name although I understand the connotation and simply understand I contain it all I know what I need to know when I need to know it here is what I desire to know and then you trust what comes that is a mechanism for ushering in things that might normally seem not to you aware of it so does that information in every cell in our body absolutely in fact all information is in every cell of your body for your body physically speaking in consciousness why is this holographic where each point contains the totality of all creation hey let me shift the being the focus I want to put on being non-physical we don't have any cells in your body you're non-physical I'm asking you to tell us what's it like to be non-physical well first of all understand by choice I still express myself as a physical being so therefore it is not the focus of my experience and exploration perhaps for the purposes of simple explanation when you first express yourself as non-physical from being physical and as I have mentioned there are other gradations of physical before you would do so creating consciously creating purposefully and having your life being a statement of your creation is the next step in your consciousness evolution not becoming non-physical non-physical would be after that in the way that you create linear time but the idea is when you first begin to express yourself as non-physical there is still a seeming coagulation there is still perhaps you would say a seeming body it is referred to in many different ways by the many different cultures of your society one of them is the idea of light body but the idea is there still is an idea of a conglomeration or a focal concentration of yourself as being still seeming to a degree in the way that I can explain it to be somewhat finite or within boundaries although you understand these boundaries to be yourself more stronger as you begin to express yourself in more infinite terms then it becomes more difficult to explain for it is opposite of your chosen focus but the idea is that you can participate and experience yourself as many things simultaneously and make sense out of all of them if you do that to some degree now in fourth day in other words I can conduct many conversations at the same time and they are not confusing to me but when you are non-physical this takes on perhaps you can say a more expanded nuance they are not necessarily conversations you can experience yourself as having experiences simultaneously among other things does this make sense I think so but in non-physical situation what happens to my senses such as can I see can I hear can I feel smell you can create those focal separations but generally experience yourself perhaps you can say for lack of terminology as an isness as a pure being net and your perception of quote-unquote reality which is far different incorporates more than you perceive as your senses again did this translate I'm slowly trying to digest what you're what you can create what you refer to as your five senses but we'll not do so for your experience is more expanded your five senses are very fine funnels very physical fine funnels how are I know how are I recognize somebody or who's with me or who's around me these questions will simply be irrelevant you will simply know what you need to know if you perceive another being you will know them in the purest sense it is not a matter of needing to identify simply perceiving and understanding and knowing would I be much more aware that we are all connected we're all one far prior to that yes in other words what we are discussing one way to interpret what we are discussing is you can do that now but now it would appear as a choice against the backdrop of other choices then it will simply be perhaps you can say the only way to be we die or pass on I become non-physical then I become everything you just described when you are choosing to live a succession of lives your non-physical experience between lives has many of the qualities that I have shared with you but because of that choice of linear focus and continuity you will feel very strongly associate with the idea you call body although it would appear in that sense to be more of an imperial body and very strongly still associate with what you call the sociology of your plan so it is similar but your focus is different still focus still concentrated on what you call the physical experience almost as always I'm in a dream between lives it's like a dream perhaps not so much of the aspect of a dream where you dream you're walking down the street as the aspect of a dream that you wake up from and understand that you cannot remember what you have done but you have been quite busy does that make sense yes they did it's simple as we'll do as an analogy going along this has been very helpful thank you very much I thank you as well sharing a lot of my own well I recently read the book cosmic voyage by court and brown it sounds quite interesting are you able to comment on that at all for this time for the purposes of this discussion on anything that you wish to discuss do proceed okay great um to begin with there seems to be high probability that that is the first chance for human and extraterrestrial contact now why for the purposes of those present please define well in that of all the possibilities available to us it seems that contact with these Martian colonists who are presently occupying two locations on the planet have the high probability of occurring in the next couple of years hi actual physical interaction face-to-face interaction are you asking me or are you making a statement I'm asking what your perception of that time frame is it is not necessarily my perception that this will be settled and I am cryptic purposely and is that because of lack of a bog an attempt on our part to reach out to the populations in a sense perhaps more the idea of lack of cohesiveness of your mass conscious approach and inability to assimilate that type of reality at this present time that is one way to put it for apps though that can shift very quickly in any given sociological event a kind contact of course could occur on an individual level absolutely um are you able to discuss location at all specifically both Latin American or Central American location specifically no are you able to just to I am able to I am not willing to are you able to for that for the safety of the population or that would not be the way I would put it it is simply planting ideas from my end that would naturally occur to you and trusting that it is not my timing um also there is perhaps you will understand a system of cross verification that you wish to achieve in having this conversation and so therefore I purposely refrain to allow you to make your own decision across verification but you know latitudinal and latitudinal position I want to know if a venture into that part of the world would result in you know an actual interaction I'll bet you do now the question is do you need an external source to validate this feeling and perhaps you can say unfortunately if it is me you're out of luck um could you tell me something about the about the uh Indian population Central America are they aware of their lineage or are they so displaced from it that they are no longer in touch with their galactic heritage there are individuals who are aware there are individuals who are not they are individuals who are mistakenly aware all of these combinations exist there is what you would call quite a bit of this information though I will not comment on that as well now um bashar seems to indicate that there was a 96% accuracy in the cosmic voyage text would you concur or do you agree with that for the purposes of spicing up life a little bit and simply being who I am that is not my perception though you will generally find our perceptions to be quite similar this is an instance where it is not and the irony is that both realities can occur separately does that have to do with the interference of the channel or no though that has occurred from time to time not in this instance this is my statement in no uncertain terms that what you perceive to be the reality the way it is does not exist there is not the way it is there is what you decide it is and the experience that you create based on that decision there is no one history this is what happens there are an infinite number of history and then you create a meaning and attachment and then you act as though in the present that was your history and so therefore because your actions express it that was your history no matter whether it was the history of someone else or not so what I am commenting on what I am participating in in having this conversation with you is the reminder that nothing is etched nothing is the way it is and that what you do now who you are now will determine your expression and your perception will determine how you act and what you perceive or experience so your comments are then basically aimed at me individually in my perception of perhaps that loosening you up individual but also expressing to everyone present that it is completely up to you who you are it is completely up to you to define why you are the way that you are whether you use a history or not that history is always perhaps you can say 100% subjective even if there were an event that occurred as many individuals as you have perceiving that event is truly how many events occurred actually more events occurred than that but I will not go into that but the idea is nobody perceiving an event is any less correct than anyone else's perception unless someone talks them into the idea of deciding that there is less correct and so therefore even if there were one historical event if there are 100 people witnessing it there are 100 distinct different versions of the same one event and to make things even more interesting there is not one event there is an infinite number of events that occur along a spectrum and the individual's decision trust and action determines which one of this multiplicity they attract as an experience which they then interpret and the moment the interpretation enters in it becomes another experience the person projects that rather than perceives it as an event does that make sense so what I am doing is freeing your mind up should you decide to entertain what I am saying to understand that the future in no way is written and also to allow you to see in no uncertain terms that though my society functions in tandem though we are all in touch with each other in a way that you do not yet understand individuals we still have differences of opinions though they are not expressed in what you call tension oriented way we still have interpretations of events that are different from each other and rather than having that be as you call it a bone of contention we revel in this and generally speaking get a good laugh out of when we differ sometimes more so than when we agree to some degree to some degree yes to some degree it has to do with linear time differences between the channel between individuals that we in that sense interact with from the perspective of the channels perhaps one way you can put it is that from the perspective of Andrew's path at least for now to his decision shifts it is a different path than perhaps since you brought it up darrel and where they to compare their path they may appear to almost be on completely different earths I do not say this to confound confused and be federal simply to understand that there is really no excuse to be anything other than you are unless you create the need to rationalize that you are not who you are in that case were you able to discuss briefly the methodology of communication in that area between third density and fourth density reality which you spoke about in the past I think a couple of times specifically what do you mean well you've spoken about a dream basis of communication but you've also mentioned an ability to actually make an observation to simplify this and not have fourth density be this dangling carrot that you never quite reach understand that you are third transitional fourth density beings right now third being a very limited contracted view and approach and experience of reality fourth being a very expanded view approach and perception of your reality in any given moment that you are effortless and joyously expressing yourself no matter what it is walking down your street sitting in your chair no matter what it is you are in a fourth density consciousness you are expressing the natural participation of yourself with the reality that you have chosen to create consciously which is the definition perhaps you can say if you were to describe a definition of fourth density does that make sense so you communicate constantly when your decision waivers your most empowered decision will generally be a fourth density decision I am who I am and that's all that I am however when you waiver and say oh this circumstance tells me I'm not that person I'm this far more contracted less expanded person who is not able to affectually express their reality consciously then you are adapting a third density approach it's more of an emotional difference rather than a physical linear transformation it will express itself across the board of belief emotion thought and action not simply emotional when you decide I am who I am everything falls into that place you choose to express the empowered belief knowing you contain both beliefs and don't have to get rid of a disempowered belief but are simply choosing the empowered belief when you choose that empowered belief the emotions are generally supported and positive seeming emotions your thought patterns your thinking fall into pattern place from that fourth density decision and so do your action the difference between third and fourth density isn't one of an actual physical location but more of a way of looking at things or thinking of things or for the purposes of this explanation yes although there is something to what you are saying generally what you are saying is used as a distraction from what I am saying when you consistently just to explain what I mean express your positive decision and seeming that sense to be fourth density consistently then there are changes in your body there are changes in your reality there are changes in those around you and so one way to look at it one way to describe it is that you have changed your location in your entire reality but more accurately you shift and you seem to be in the same place with everything around you changing so you need not concentrate on getting anywhere as much as being here for the idea of focusing on getting to fourth density is a third density approach does that make sense or is this entirely confusing is that all I thank you I am reading my friend and being your you are still supine on your table I have a great half of the information I absolutely can I shall not perhaps later the idea is that I am maintaining a specific focus that I find most enjoyable therefore I will entertain your ideas at a later time in my time frame jumping jack one moment all right I can do that by definition that's great and the size and shape of my craft is not what you would consider to be consistent and can change this my craft is perhaps literally to you would seem to express itself as a living entity though it is in a crystalline structure great we think good for you as far as feedback in my reality I think it is really wonderful feedback in my creations it all is wonderful though and that is the point I am making so should something come along that would appear to be discontinuous with those joyful feedbacks my point is that that is no less joyful simply that you are not looking at it necessarily from the perspective of the new decision and not assuming that no matter how you are looking at it it contains something very important that reinforces the decision but by all means enjoy your continuous ecstasy well it seems like there is a shift that has gone on with me that my ability to take action and completely trust me trust in my decisions seems to have just pretty much magically on some level appeared in my life and you know a series of events I guess and as I create time along the timeline it is here now you all make your decision about who you are and simply the easiest way to have that be most natural is to trust yourself to know who you are or even if you decide you are someone else because someone else said you make that decision you know yourself the best though you have the expression I know you better than you know yourself that is not possible an individual can know their version of you better than you know yourself but it is not your version of yourself and it is irrelevant many times many aspects of it are irrelevant to who you say you are so it all boils down to in making the decision being willing to trust yourself even if that decision seems to be unconventional even if you are closing up your business everyone knows you shouldn't do that everyone doesn't know anything but what they know and if you buy into everyone knows you should not do that you are not trusting yourself if that is what you know you need to do and only can you explore the fruits of yourself trust by being willing to commit to it and be that you want to be back to the beginning most others are reflections in nature which has been one of my strongholds I love nature a great deal and one thing I wanted to ask you about is the idea of feathers and first of all you have feathers when you are birds if you are not precisely know though we have observed them upon your planet yeah you have physically we have seen what you say are called birds yes we are not completely oblivious however the symbol is simply a reinforcement of your willingness to literally trust yourself and take flight as that bird for that idea of a feather though it can mean as many different things as there are individuals deciding what does this mean generally speaking is a symbol that enables you to ride to fly to soar that's what's been asked for your perception of feathers I know that you know in our native american cultures they recognize this is a great deal and they find a lot of power in it and that is generally most literally the symbol they use to fly to soar to ride each specific bird we break down or animal is what's called totems they specifically have different functions to us different reflections in our lives well you may agree societally that this is consistent but it is not each individual has a different relationship if you read the books discuss with other individuals and agree this means this means this means that there can seem to be a common meaning but it is as what you call the interpretation of your dream there is only a common meaning when you agree that there is it means to you whatever it is that it means to you and perhaps using it to inspire different aspects of yourself is one of the more constructive uses of identifying it in that way personally right and okay I still believe at least on my planet that there's a collective similar idea with some of these animals absolutely again buy a green and I found I came upon a hawk wing that was just the wing and it was really an amazing moment and it was a gift to me and I was wondering your perception how this hawk died and you see that or doesn't it's not apparent to me right it was very unusual to explain it and it felt really pretty good do you find what you call the hawk to be a stronger more abrupt symbol of rising soaring flying? well when I found it I had this last of eagle I thought it was an eagle that I thought it was an eagle that I thought it was an eagle that I thought I went with that for about a day it was an eagle so it was a service to me through the eagle to me the hawk is a messenger and perhaps this hawk was bringing the message to the eagle it was a combination of a lot of different symbols oh since you brought it up and I am here to learn and grow as well what would be your symbolic interpretation of the eagle and the hawk? each step well the eagle to me is the idea of spirit itself that it can soar even higher than the hawk and I said the hawk to me is the message bringing about waiting for something to happen being aware of bringing awareness to my reality to something to a friend so an intermediary if you will eagle is also more of an international carrier to me along with the crow it wants a different species that can come to you so to me I get a reflection of that I am ready even more to get another step in my reality oh wait revel in the unexpected but the idea is to be from the definition that you have shared with me the eagle to assume the posture if you will the orientation of the eagle will assist you to skip an intermediate step and simply be who you are which you are already doing to some degree in terms of consciously it feels right now it feels right now that's one more small question proceed it's about our dream reality I mean we were talking about different feedback in our waking dream yet in our sleeping dream of course we get to be back there too but specifically Ellie and I had a similar dream and the first time it's ever happened we woke up and she heard did the lights just go out in your dream and they did it we both had the same instantaneous scenario where the lights went out oh there is fascinating this is more common than you might imagine and why it is generally obscured in terms of recognizing it is that your level of interpretation individual interpretation in dreams may seem a bit higher than in this perhaps you would call it waking dream reality in that were there to be a single event while you are awake you would generally agree about what it is that you had both observed when you get into the dream reality you diverge farther away from that for your attention is on more in terms of a more expanded perception and therefore when you find areas of commonality you can often realize we did have very much the same experience but we came at it from our slightly different interpretive mind does that make sense? that's exactly what we explained and what allows you to become more consciously aware of it is when you do find a blatant common symbol such as lights going out you simply discuss it and you will find by discussing it by having the feeling that comes along with the recognition that you have had this common experience you will begin to expand the experience though again you may come to the conversation both saying the lights went out but one would say on my side of the room it was blue and on your side of the room it was yellow and you will notice what you noticed on your side of the room where only for a fleeting moment was there a common occurrence that you both noticed does that make sense? well in fact there was no accident you were telling us to do it and tell us to do it and you say she liked she fell out of a guy in yellow and of course the right part of you told us in a way that we were ready to approach this individual and he was a yellow for her and for me it was like a blue light that was out the window but that is the idea you can interpret similar things in different ways but should you find a blatant symbol that you can both agree upon and you continue to discuss the interactions you will find certain things were similar for both ah there was a table here there was a chair there oh I didn't have that chair ah but we both had the table this idea will allow you to realize that that is how your waking dream actually is as well and that if you cut individual slack in their interpretation allow however they perceive their reality to be valid and simply converse and revel in the common perception that you need not invalidate people for their differences and can validate them across the board does that make sense? yes thank you thank you very much at this timing we will pause for a break the length of which to be determined by you and resume contact after that timing
