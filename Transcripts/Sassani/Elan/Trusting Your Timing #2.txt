 All right, I'll say, before we continue, allow me to say, though we have mentioned that perhaps on mass, perhaps in a global sense, it may be many years before you seem that all of your planet becomes oriented toward positive transformation. This by no means is meaning in any way to assume that you cannot immediately feel the effects of personal transformation and through your participation in personal transformation, you can literally accelerate the timing of the mass transformation. Now, there are many different forms that transformation will take. You will always fundamentally emanate or begin or initiate from your consciousness from within. But there are many different, shall I say, footprints, many different expressions of the transformation of consciousness. One of them is what you would call your weather, for your weather is simply an expression of the emotional body of your mass consciousness, so to speak, and very many other of what you would call the changes that occur upon your planet are not separate from you, are expression of transformation. Certain individuals will in that sense choose to transform smoothly, transform effortlessly. Other individuals, perhaps you can say, far more choose to live, perhaps in one way, an exciting type of tumultuous transformation. You may understand, though you are seeing the occurrence of many, shall I say, tumultuous occurrences upon your planet seemingly packed very densely into one's time frame. There are many different ways, as I have said, many different truths on how to interpret this. One of the ways of interpret it that we have become aware of through, again, members of your society, and particular points of view, is that you are going, as you say, to hell in a hand-vasket. Another way that individuals will choose to create this is the end is nigh. These individuals will possibly experience a version of this, for again, you always get the results of the reality you are creating. Whatever, there are other truths, other orientations, other ways to look at the exact same set of circumstances. You may understand that as you do shift and change, so does your planet. Your planet is alive. Your planet is not merely a hunk of rock floating in space, just happening to spin at a particular velocity, just happening to occupy an intelligent, orbital path, that is. You may understand that it too is a consciousness, is an expression. So therefore, you will see from time to time certain outbursts, certain types of physical results that occur. And if you will simply understand that as this occurs, obviously certain individuals are experiencing it by proxy, experiencing it at a distance, experiencing it, perhaps you can say colloquially on television. You may understand that there are many different ways to experience and explore these changes. Certain individuals needless to say choose to literally live on the edge. But these individuals are also creating their reality, many of them consciously as well as many of them unconsciously. One of the things that we discussed at the beginning of this interaction is that you only ever exist right here and right now. And what is right here and right now is really all there is. If you will define yourself from what is here, what is now, you will expand yourself to the many possibilities of what is available to you. If you define yourself in the here and now, according to the there and then your history, you can experience an effect that it seems right here and now that you are at, shall I say, the imprisonment of your history. However that is only a perspective. Anything that has occurred in your past has absolutely no effect on you right here and right now until you say that it does, act that way and then of course the evidence comes along that this seems to be so. Therefore on some level, as you create the many levels that you exist upon, individuals who will not consciously look at themselves as existing in the here and now and still strongly identify with the past, still know that they do exist right here and now, still sense that there is a transformation taking place and again perhaps on a more knowing level, understand that a quote unquote breaking of the shackles of the past is the only way they can drive themselves, force themselves into the here and now. This is one of the reasons that what you are calling some of your cataclysmic seeming events are having what you call minimal loss of life but maximum loss of belonging, maximum loss of vestiges and remnants of the past that many people use to continue to limit themselves in the present. So from an all knowing, all seeing perspective, individuals will actually force themselves to literally disintegrate, destroy as you say many of these and I will phrase this purposely this way excuses for moving on, excuses for living now. So this is just one of many of the overall general reasons that you are singing individuals seemingly losing their belongings, losing their heirloom, losing their chests, their memoirs, but keeping their lives and being very, very, very literally thrust into the here and now or all that stuff is no longer available. Now needless to say, at least at this timing, you are not creating your reality in forcing yourself to disavow a hold that your past may have upon you and one of the reasons for this is because you are giving yourself the choice to consciously do so rather than forcing yourself to see it in no uncertain terms. Your willingness to understand that though past events may seem to lead to a present event, but your present is no longer bound or a direct result of your past experientially allows you to stop using your path as an excuse. You are who you are right now. Whatever happened, quote back then, happened is over with. If it seems to enter into the now, it is because you let it in and you are not experiencing what happened then. You are recreating a version which is very often quite different from the original circumstance that applies to the things that you are exploring right now. Therefore along those lines, you may understand the present need not be a result of the past experientially. You can simply choose to create yourself how you prefer to be right now because the past is not an experience but only a notion, only a concept. You can even if you wish to play this game, create whatever past you would have needed to have to be the person you wish to be right now. And you would be doing nothing different from what you are already doing with quote unquote your real past. But again, I remind you what you are remembering is not precise. You are a different person. You have different knowledge. You have an expanded awareness. You know more. Therefore, who you were quote unquote back then could not have had the same experience you are having now dragging this past into the present. Therefore simply by seeing what's available, by sticking to the criteria we discussed at the beginning of this interaction, when a seeming past comes up, ask yourself, can I act upon this right now and if the answer is no, just like you pushed your clear intention aside, pushed the path aside, when you do you will again see you will unobstruct your vision as to what's right here and now, the unique advantage of the moment. Bigger dive throw that in. I thank you and once again, open up this interaction to sharing. Hey, Spiemail. Hi, Mom. Greetings. It was so wonderful. You connected to your again for a long time. Well, we have in that sense often stated that we connect on many levels. You consider this level that we are speaking, so to speak, to be the conscious level, but we exist and we shall I say experience the many other levels that we create as we expand and interact on you with you as well on those levels. So pleasant dreams. And I just had a dream about you. Right before I was thinking about this interaction. That's why I'm here. Oh, right. We figured we'd phone ahead. And this is a great topic, Tom. Oh, thank you. They all are. There's a lot of things that I want and I'm very excited about that have happened in this future. One is, remember, I was the first to Italy last summer and I'm supposed to be going to put someone in March and now I don't have changed my mind. I'm not going to finish the rest of the program, but now I want to go to Machu Picchu in August. Are you trusting the change? Yeah, I am. I mean, I already have my plane ticket purchase to go to Switzerland to finish the program and I'm going to pay the tuition. You don't remember that $10,000 I made it. And I don't want to know anymore. I've done what I needed to do. I'm not excited anymore. So I'm trusting. I want to go with the shaman to Machu Picchu. I really am very excited. So I'm going to do that. Now, as I have said, you wanted to go and now no longer want to go, so are you really missing anything? I guess I'm not, but I'm still having a little head to finish this. A little head to finish this. Should. All right. You should finish this. According to who? I don't know. According to everyone knows you shouldn't leave loose and dangling. Or according to who you know yourself to be. Right. Right. Let's see. Oh. Therefore, you have allowed me to illustrate. And very important point. If your excitement shifts, if something no longer excites you, that is because whatever you have done because you were excited about it has already delivered to you everything you need. So as well as I am asking you or suggesting that you may trust your excitement, trust when the excitement shifts. You need not feel in that sense that it is loose and sometimes that's how a stepping stone will fall. And by in that sense, not concentrating on what no longer excites you, but now seeing what now excites you, you're back on, shall I say, the path that you are? So to speak. Right. Then we got that shift in my consciousness. By the way, again, the everyone knows this and that is simply assuming that there is an everyone out there. But everything's within you. Do proceed. So that's in the future. And then I want to, my intention is to move to Atlanta, Georgia with my boyfriend. And that's often the future. So I'm not excited about being in this present moment right now. Why not? Because it's boring. So you are not assuming the perspective of exploring, of examining the unique opportunities and advantages of the moment. How is that to you? It's true. I'm not. I don't see that. Do you wish to continue to do that? No. It's just concerning. Do you understand that it is simple and as simple as reminding yourself, wait a minute. This moment perhaps is not the only extraneous moment in my life. Perhaps there is a unique advantage in this moment. A matter of fact, that is my foundation that there is a unique advantage in each moment. So rather than looking at what is not there, push that aside. What is there? It can seem from time to time, like of the options. These options are all quite mundane. Well, I could take a walk. I could watch TV down to that level. But if you even choose from those options the most exciting one, which may in the scheme of your excitement not seem that exciting, but is the most exciting from what's available. Then you will begin to roll back into being able to see and appreciate each moment. It's simply again a matter of taking that step, taking that leap, trusting that here are very relatively unexciting things, but one still stands out as being more exciting. I will trust that degree and then taking the step, not just the mentalizing, but taking the step, acting according to the most exciting one. Are you willing to take that step? This is where you are quote unquote hanging up. Right. Yeah. All right. Does the moment seem a little bit more exciting? Yeah. Do you experience a delicious anticipation now that you are willing to not let one moment slip by? Yeah. Oh, not as sure. All right. Frustration is not being in the moment. That is all it is. It is assuming something is better than the moment. The posture of assuming that something is better in the moment is just the same thing as putting a blindfold onto that moment. So that is a perspective that you are actively participating in. There is something better. Push that aside. Then you will find that blindfold perhaps become sunglasses, eventually prescription lenses. Do you understand the analogy? Yeah. Oh. I have to take that long but it has to go from sunglasses. No, no, no. Simply being cute as you said. The idea is it can be quite quick. But it does effectually seem to put on blinders to assume there is something better. Assuming something better is the action is the orientation of not looking at what's there. What is out there that you like is just as good as what is there. It is simply operating from an assumption. And then chucking the timing when it doesn't feel like the right timing gets to move down to that moment. Now understanding that and knowing it will occur beyond the shadow of a doubt, do you choose to mope around from now till then or do you choose to drink deeply from what's there? It is boiling down to that. All right. Okay. Does this help? Yes, it does and I knew this. I just knew it. Thank you for marrying me. Oh, is there anything else that you wish to expand upon? Yes, one thing is, I guess it's on the subject, but remember my future self, Aliyota? No. No kidding. Your future self would correspond to one of my present contemporaries, of course. Before you proceed. Timing, timing. You always know what you need to know when you need to know it. You always have everything you need when you need it. Therefore, if something is not present, that is just as much an answer than if it is. If you are interacting with me and for some reason, I were not to give you an answer, that is your answer. So you can act as your mean answer. The idea is you will find as you actively engage in your moment to moment reality, that connection will be more realized because that is her perspective. You identify more strongly with her by acting as her, while still maintaining your own unique version. Does that make sense and does that answer the question? Yes. Oh, you think so? No, you have to say. Oh my. Thank you. Mail. I'm a little confused about past confusion. Very healthy. I worked with a fellow today and he had a guilt about something that happened in a past life. Well, if you say so, he is recreating an emotion that he is ascribing to a once or twice removed source, but he is creating any guilt that he is experiencing in the moment and can only experience the creation of guilt if right here, right now, he is not unconditionally loving himself. Regardless of any label he ascribes to it. Exactly what I came up with. Thank you. That's great. Thank you. Perhaps you will sit up here next time. In the session, we did address that. Unconditional love for himself. And the letting go of the judgments that he had about the past. Now you hit, as you say, the nail on the head, what an archaic reference, letting go, which implies that he is holding on. Judgment does not hold on to you, has no power over you. You, not you personally, but you know what I mean? When you do so, hold on with clutching death grip to your own judgment and therefore, releasing is far simpler than having to bat it away. Letting go through the reaffirmation of your unconditional self love through your insistence that you will accept nothing less from yourself. You proceed. So he had this recurring dream of something that happened in this past and he kept bringing it back in dream form at night, night sleeping dream. So my question is, isn't that dream? Is that something that says teaching him something? Well, ultimately, anything you experience has a left in place into it. Whether an individual is willing to act upon it will always be up to the individual. One of the options in anything that you refer to as recurring in the dream state always allows the individual the option to approach that seemingly recurring situation in another way. So therefore, as your ancient American Indians will say, when you have a recurring dream of a bear chasing you, when you decide to turn around and face that bear, you have done something different and therefore will often find that what is staring you in the face is not a bear but is a notion from within you, a child from within you allowing you to identify something that you are now willing to reconcile. Do you understand? Yes. Therefore, can you be more specific in sharing the symbology of the recurring dream? What is the dream? The dream he was in, he was in the war and they attacked his ship and a lot of ships and there were flames and he had to abandon ship and who was on a raft and others were in the water and were burnt and were killed and he felt guilty. Why? He got to the back. He did burn them or kill them. Well, some of them they had to push off the raft, I guess, in his dream. I mean, he was pretty graphic about it. They had to push some off the raft because they had died or they wouldn't make it or whatever. But he felt guilty that he survived and they did. Oh, one. Do understand that this is the imposition of conditions. Obviously, he survived. Obviously, they did not. Now, his willingness to be responsible for himself will simply allow him to see that this occurs in your world. His insistence on needing to be responsible for them, which is truly not even possible, for they have their choices and their reality, is perhaps where he is hanging up. Now another way to look at this is given a similar set of circumstances. What would he do now? That in questioning him to this degree, you may find that certain shall I say choices that he would make would differ now. That is all that he can be responsible for. What he would do now, not what was done then. So allow him to explore how he would handle that now. Does that make sense? Yes. Oh, does that assist you? Yes. Now, he has an illness. He has a liver disease. It is my opinion that that disease drew him to me. We had this session. In this session, of course, I asked him to forgive himself and to allow the people that died to be okay if they chose to die. There was nothing that he could do about it and after learning that, he could now heal the liver disease. And what occurred? Well, he did a meditation and he felt like that. That's just what he did. The thing now is, of course, how you get off the medicine. That's up to him and his doctors. Well, that is up to him, his doctors and any other feedback that he will attract. So it's a very rewarding and it's funny that you brought up this about. Oh, it's not fun. You do it all the time. Thank you. Bring it up tonight about letting go of those fears. For being in a now, one of the mechanisms with which you can act on releasing judgment, self-judgment, judgment toward others, which is a form of self-judgment, is what you call forgiveness, which as your literature says, is divine in the aspect that it takes into consideration that the reality exists within you, that everything is a valid exploration that all truths are true. Always gets back to these concepts. They can always be used in this way. I see the connection. Now use them if you wish. I do not insist that you have too much fun or have too much of an ecstatic life. It is up to you. Don't share them. Be responsible to him and not for him. Then you will be an example of that mechanism as well. He will make his choices and you can interact and assist to whatever degree you are able, but you cannot make his choices for him just as he was not able to make the choices of the others in the aforementioned circumstance. So show him an example of that in your own interaction with him, if you wish. One more question. I had my hands smashed in a door and a car door. I said, I set the door and my hands smashed all my fingers. Something told me that it is okay. I just pulled the fingers out, shook it off and it was done. Did you picture broken fingers or fixed ones? Ah, you will often find when individuals create pain, they then assign that portion of their body with a vision or view of that portion in a dis-ease state. And in a sense, this is one of the initiating forces to create the dis-ease state. I suggest, as you have demonstrated, that when you feel physical pain, when you feel a unpleasant sensation, that that is an opportunity. Well, how is that an opportunity, you ask? I'll tell you. Because that allows you to direct very specifically your intention to that area, but you have the option of doing so by picturing that area in whatever your version of that portion, so to speak, of your being as perfect, and you will find when you ascribe to pain a dis-ease counterpart, you will create a dis-ease counterpart. When you use pain to pinpoint where to picture perfection, where to picture a perfectly functioning organ, for instance, then you can create that effect very specifically guided to that area. And this is one of the mechanisms that individuals create what you call this ease through, what you call visualizing, taking for granted that the part is this ease, simply using pain as the evidence. And do you understand the difference? Yes. Therefore, if it hurts, picture it well. If it still hurts, go to the doctor. Now I say this jokingly, but understand that you will function through your most bought into belief system. And often if you believe that that is the only way that you will reconcile a particular situation, attracting that symbol can allow you to reconcile it and then take back the power and begin to take the steps to understand that even the doctor is only a symbol. The doctor says, do this, do this, do that, and it will get better. You believe him. You give the power or her. You give the power to that symbol, but you do the healing, basically using that as an excuse. But at least acknowledge what your strongest belief system is. You will often find in doing what I have shared in terms of picturing the part, again, colloquially part of your body as perfection, that the pain will subside, that the sensation will immediately decide and the going to the doctor, so to speak, option will not be necessary. But continue to acknowledge what you do believe that is the only way to change any belief or express a difference belief is to acknowledge the belief you already have. So thank you for allowing me to illustrate that. It works so much on a broken bone in the body. Well, yes. You understand and express the belief that it does, but this is a belief that many individuals will agree upon is unlikely. And so you, in that sense, get the opportunity to get in touch with if you believe it or not. Something like on Star Trek? What do you mean? I do not watch Star Trek. The new generation, he broke a bone and she puts a machine on it and just a little bit of light. Next thing you know, it is all fine. One moment. Allow me to access this from another point of view. From my perspective, yes, that light instrument would be the symbol in which the individual used to heal themselves. So that is possible. Absolutely. Anything is? Well, thank you. But the question is what will you choose from the multiplicity, the infinity of possibility? Choice enters in. This is creatorhood. Creatorhood is no longer saying life happens to me. Creatorhood is accepting and embodying and insisting that life happens through me and from me. And that is a choice. One. Another last question. Proceed. It is okay. It is transforming itself. Will I go through more? Body changes or the word I am thinking of is pain. Why would you say? Transformation does not result in what you call physical pain. Resistance to transformation done. So simply look at where you are resisting your change and dive into it. And you will also find that to be a perspective in transforming pain. You don't get rid of pain anyway, you transform it. You can't get rid of it. Where will you put it? You're everything. It's not so much pain. Vibrations are the heartbeat almost. You understand what I am saying. It is the fear of pain ultimately. Ivan? Thank you. I am. Greetings. And to you, good day. You know, on last August, the United States Space Agency, NASA, claimed to have lost communications for the $1 billion space craft and Mars Observer. Hi. And they didn't really offer much of an explanation in the ensuing days. They are not really sure. And there was one researcher who was a former NASA consultant who appeared on the cable news network which televised millions of people around the world. And he claimed that insiders told him that NASA pulled a plug on it in the project because the Mars Observer, whether it was high resolution cameras that could photograph objects as small as a Volkswagen from orbit, photograph unnatural formations in detail such as the face and pyramids that resemble pyramids in Egypt. And others that are not existed upon your planet. Right. And so it's his contention that the government is covering up their knowledge that extraterrests you like, definitely exist. Allow me to save a following on it. No about it. The idea is not so much too laid blame, but the idea is once again to trust the timing. What I will share that from my perspective, such structures they exist. And such structures then bring along with them certain expanded ideas about perhaps you can understand as your place in the cosmos, your place in the galactic family. But it is a matter of timing and it is unimportant as to who did what is more again trusting your timing. This will come out. Can you give me some idea of what happened to it? Well ultimately it would fall under what you call malfunction, I will say no more. The idea is it is not the timing for the masses at this time. There's no one on this planet. It would not serve the purpose that it could serve for individuals to find out on mass later. So are there any individuals on this planet still in communication with that space for a while? Do not mean to be vague or nebulous, but are respecting your choice societally of timing and are therefore answering the question in as direct a way as possible without adding anything else. Well apparently there was no problems at all with a spacecraft. You know we travel through space for millions of miles and it gets right in the orbit of Mars and then all of a sudden they lose communications with it. It just seems to be more than enough. Well how intriguing and you get to look at this, but you understand that there are some time unexpected shall I say gravimetric phenomenon that could account for it and I will simply say no more. Thank you. Is there something else you wish to ask? Is there something else you wish to ask? I wasn't going to ask this, but I guess I will. What extent have extraterrestrials played a role in the evolution of man on this planet? Humans shall I say. What I will share is that there is a direct connection. There is a direct interaction in what you call your ancient history. But from that point on it is still up to the consciousness to the individual incarnating in this society to completely create their own reality. So it has no effect upon who you are now, but does explain certain phenomenon of what you are referring to as your evolution. Thank you. Thank you. And it has nothing to do with our society, which would far more represent a future expression than a past. However we have connections peripherally to that phenomenon, which I will not explain now. You are? All right. Thank you. Hey Steve. Hello. Greetings. Wonderful to meet you. This is my first time with you and I'm very excited about it. Thank you, but it is my first time as well and I am ecstatic. Thank you very much. I want to find out from you how I can reach that part of my consciousness that is holding on to a series of blood clots in my feet and my lower legs where I have very core circulation. And I understand what you said earlier about picturing how you like your physical body to work. Now you understand this, but what have you been doing? Do you not have a strong definition of vision of these clots? Yes, I do. That is what perpetuates it. And I'd like to know why I have that perpetual vision of the slots. Well simply because no one has told you there is an alternative first of all, and now you are attracting a mirror to allow yourself to reflect that there is first of all second of all, though you may appear to be a collection of parts. You are truly a whole integrated being. Your willingness to acknowledge yourself as one whole being rather than a collection of parts allows you access to your wholeness and does not cut off the flow once you create parts you then create a responsibility to have to connect to all these parts as though they are separate. So first of all envisioning yourself as a whole in your meditative state and visually yourself as one complete sphere of energy non-differentiated. And secondly when you feel a sensation that you have heretofore ascribed as a clock, as a block, to understand that you can now create your version of healthy vessel, healthy artery, healthy vein and replace that you will immediately, immediately begin to feel things you have not felt in a long time and to understand how nothing is holding you. You are perpetuating something. You need not partition yourself off while making yourself into parts and then ascribe that a part has control over you. Simply release it and think in terms of flow rather than stoppage. Thank you very much. Oh thank you. All your timing. Hi. Mayo. My interaction that I was at last springtime, you spoke of a major UFO event that would happen in October of 93. I spoke of a major event that would happen. Individuals ascribe many labels, UFO, this and that. However what occurred occurred on many minute levels rather than one overall level and facilitated again the release of the information that your government does have. You will begin to find evidence of this in the upcoming months. I never actually defined a specific event, perhaps was a little vague as individuals groped around to their ideas of what might occur. But what I will say is that there are portions of your planet where there were increased mass sightings, one of the areas you would call Mexico City. There were also certain direct interactions that I cannot at this time go into more detail upon. But things did occur that now allow more information to begin to filter out. I also have another question concerning using the Ouija board. Oh. Can you talk about that a little bit as far as influencing my through and how safe it actually is to you? Anything is as safe as you ascribe. Setting up a protection in that sense is the assumption of an imminent attack. So what is the same as staying, you believe an attack would be most likely. You can simply transform this attitude into understanding the following. You can only by definition experience a reality that you are the vibration of. Therefore if you are unconditionally loving, if you express that love and life, only can you experience that particular reality. And what you call negative circumstance becomes somewhat blind to that. Especially with an absolute insistence on maintaining it and labeling anything no matter what somebody's intention is first as neutral and then as how it serves you rather than what is happening to you. So understand there need not be a protection. There is no imminent attack. You will only attract through whatever symbol that particular symbol simply being one removed symbol that individuals will trust to allow others forms of consciousness to communicate to come through. Simply clarify your intention and what you would call safety becomes a new point. Do you understand? Yes I understand. I feel that the participation on that would not, I wouldn't have a problem with that in any way. But no matter what comes through simply accept it to the degree that it serves you and to the degree that it does not assume that it has the right and reason to exist for someone else. Okay. And have a good time. And finally could you discuss the interaction with aliens during the times of Atlantis? All we can share in this regard is that there was more of the widespread understanding of the existence of extraterrestrial. So from time to time this would be an open occurrence. However, as individuals began to submerge interestingly enough their consciousness and began to become oblivious of these realities that began a cycle that you are now perhaps you can say transforming or emerging from. In terms of the specifics, the society, this is not yet the timing to discuss it. In terms of the fact that prior to their sub-mergence there was an awareness, yes I will confirm that. Okay. Thank you. Oh thank you. Over there. Finale. Hello. I want to have some. Speak up so that all may share. Go again. Now I'm in a position at work where I feel to stay would be to condone another person's truth other than mine. Oh. But the struggle I'm having is that if I leave it's I don't know if I'm giving up or creating a situation that will have to be replayed or something. It was part of me to saying that. All right. So I'm going to see why would you need to replay it? Are you avoiding something or are you simply moving towards something more representative of who you choose to be? Well there's nothing beyond this. If I let go of this I don't see anything beyond it. Is what you're doing exciting you? No. Is it supporting you? No. Oh wait. What do you have to lose? Okay. What does excite you? By the way that is what is the honor? You get to honor and begin to explore what does excite you? What moves you? If you had a magic lamp and rubbed it and got a wish what would you do? And it's what? Oh. Very exciting. Yes. Very holistic. Very honoring of the energy in each and every individual. Have a good time. Thank you. Do you sense that this can support you? No. Ah. Perhaps then you would not have a good time. Why not? No. What you are doing now does it in some sense support your lifestyle? Yes. So doing what does not excite you has supported you? Yes. Yes. Does it make sense that something more representative of who you are would be less likely to support you or more likely to support you in proportion to the degree of that it is an expression of who you are? What makes sense? Intellectually it makes sense to do what excites me would. Ah. Collection of parts again. You know. Imagine what it would feel like if you were doing what it is you say you wish to do and it was supporting you. Make believe. It would be joy. Can you feel that? Imagine what it would feel like and describe it to me. I feel it to my whole body. Is it pleasant? Yes. Very pleasant. Ah. Now you have done two things. Oh. Intellectually you understand that and emotionally you have created that particular understanding as well. Yes. I will share a little secret with you. That is no secret at all. The only way you were able to feel it was that you must in that moment have been it. And that was very simple was it not? That is all there is to it. So it's okay to just let go of this. Well again if there is something you are seeming to avoid look at it by all means nothing can destroy you. What is it? They don't know. It is not obvious that you are avoiding something. You assume you are not. Do not create layers of complexity. If you are avoiding something it will be completely obvious. Oh wonderful. Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you. You have done it all. I am simply sitting here. So to speak. Hello. Hey. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Try that again. Hello. Hello. Hello. We want a little bit. Hi. Hi. I want to respect yourself. Greeting a being from another planet. How do you sound? Greetings my dear friend. Oh thanks. And I wanted to start out by thanking you for that little exercise or that visualization or suggestion that you gave me of imagining how to meet it loves myself would act because by imagining that and then acting that way I significantly improved the fulfillment that I get in the interactions with my mother and other family members. You mean to tell me that this stuff works? It works. Now prior to doing this you perform as action. Did we not in your discussion did you not assume that no matter what your perspective is your for instance mother would continue to berate you as your sibling. Yes. Yes I did. Did you not prove to yourself that you could not change them but by shifting your perspective they interact with the shift in you. It's true. Did they not seem to change miraculously? They did change and all the same miraculous. Was it hard or simple? No it was really pleasurable. I found a lot of love more satisfaction than I've ever found there before. And now I'm looking forward to seeing her which is something new. Thank you. Thank you for your willingness not to do something that I have said but to honor yourself and allow others the gifts of who you are. Now proceed with the buck. I know this one quite well. There are two general areas women and a career. Both of which we've discussed but do proceed. Okay. I'm in a last year I briefly dated this woman who when we separated I felt a much higher level anxiety than I would have expected from someone that I did you know I felt we wouldn't be together in a long term way. Oh right now. When was this? Last May. Oh my god. This was perhaps a different year. Yeah. Oh my god. Then we got together again last weekend and knowing just as friends but even after I left her I felt it was really I didn't really quite understand it's just so sad. It's like someone really important had been taken away from me but taken away. Whatever. Who you desire to interact with this individual. I don't. Yes or no. Maybe. Right. The thing that what I do desire is to have a fulfilling relationship or a marriage with a woman and I want to get through all the remaining beliefs in that area that don't serve me and I thought this might have been indicating some kind of belief in there about my inadequacy without a woman or something like that. It's still indicated to you that in that moment you are not completely being the you that loves yourself or what you have expressed as a law. Presumes that you are not complete and that something can be lost. Simply a tap on the shoulder a reminder. Now the you that love yourself. Placing that you I understand this is hypothetical and we do not generally do this. Well placing you in that situation what does that you experience when that individually. Peace because I trust that I'll have to have everything I want. Do you really feel that as I am suggesting it. Well it has to work on that a little. You have to work on it you are not expressing the you that loves you you are hypothesizing. The you that already loves you feel that you imbue yourself with that you and describe to me again how that you feel when that individual leaves boldly with conviction. I feel that. I do feel that not I would you are still removing and creating the you that loves you as being separate from the you you are. I do feel that she's my sister and whether or whether or not we're together that we'll both have everything that we need. How does that feel when you are saying. It feels better because you know I think it makes me realize part of the underlying fear was that I might not have what I want in terms of her relationship. You get what you want if you say so. Now how does that feel. It feels better. It feels better. Oh think of the years of psychotherapy that you have to say. All that groping for the hidden beliefs behind every door. The you that loves you releases these beliefs does not assume there is something in the way. There are no interruptions you are the path you cannot be off yourself. Well I really want that to have that relationship and it's beautiful to feel that I'll have it I just kind of maybe feel a little bit like it's not happening fast enough. Oh not trusting the timing. All right that's one of the reasons you are here. In this instance utilize the reminder that you get what you want. See how that feels and then push it aside. Dive back into the moment. That is all I can say in terms of direct approach. But when you do that you will continue to create the you that loves you. For the you that loves you will settle for nothing less. My concern is that in bringing this relationship about I may have to go through some more painful interactions with women to surface police that I'm not aware of. Does the you that loves you choose this route? No but why do you assume that you must do so? Why are you imposing a no pain no gain philosophy? It's just something you are choosing to do. It is the imposition of a condition. You love yourself you get what you want what excites me from what's available act on it with integrity period. Well there's a woman I dated four years ago that I loved and I haven't called back. She broke up with me I haven't called back because I was afraid she would reject me. But I have some guidance the other last week that I should learn to enjoy my life now because if I can enjoy it now the way it is I'll never learn to enjoy it. So I was thinking well she's someone I still care for so maybe I should give her a call. Well by all means however no matter what another individual intends for or toward you in terms of acceptance and rejection as you say only will you feel rejected when you match that rejection when you reject yourself. So when you call her remember that one that loves you calling her will perhaps have more success regardless of the outcome than any other version of the you that you create. So that model that referential preferential you is completely applicable in any situation not only. And one said use this with a family all right oh work marvelously over here what do I do apply the referential preferential you across the board you will feel differently you will present differently you will listen different responses and no matter what that response is you will love yourself anyway thereby not being able to lose anything only being able to share and interact and co-create but still never winding up with anything less than yourself. What about this old belief that I'm incomplete without a woman is that a block is to me having that relationship. Allow me to use this as an example you contain the belief that you are incomplete without someone else yes yes you contain the belief that you are complete without someone else yes yes it is not a matter of disbelief that belief I have this one this one is in some other person's closet you have them both when you express that I am a person who can be incomplete however you act one completely disempowering way when you express the person who believes you are complete you hold your head differently you breathe differently you lunge forward into your reality differently so the only thing that determines one or the other is your actions by using the referential preferential you that loves yourself as what would that me do you will always have the empowering action you do not contain one belief and not the other you contain both now choose the one you wish to express you're at that point in your exploration. That is one way to put it absolutely the fastest most accelerated way. Okay in terms of career four months ago I tried a seminar based mostly on the stuff I've learned from you and I really enjoyed it I got a lot of positive feedback from it went well since then a lady who has a lot more experience in teaching seminars but I really respect his asking to put seminars on with them. Well you do so. Well I'll get to that. Are you there? No. Come on. Come check it. And I put on a I taught her class she teaches a normal class two nights ago and I have been I'm used to speaking in AA meetings and stuff about my story and spiritual growth and stuff and I feel very comfortable doing that usually and it goes well but I thought I would feel so bad about myself because I I realized afterwards I think I was trying to act rather than help others but I really I felt I did a bad job. Now is that a format there for allowing that situation to be a service to you that you will wish to interact in or was the original format that you set up far more conducive to express these ideas. There's much more to do. Or use again if you're going to create a history and chain yourself to it use the lessons in that sense that it brings with it and schedule your next interaction as an excite to you. Just like you did before. Do you think it makes sense to work with this woman? Do you in light of what we have just discussed and the ideas that you have just derived. Yes it's an opportunity to share something that excites me. But perhaps on a limited basis at first. Yes exactly because my what I really want to do with my career is I'm more of a hands on management economic reform kind of person and I'm looking for ways to do that. One another the stuff that you have that I've learned from you has allowed me to create a space of time now where I don't have to work for a while because I have some money so I can look into other things but I've been getting down on myself a little bit because I don't seem to be taking the kind of actions that will bring about more preferred work and if I don't act I'm going to wind up doing stuff that isn't really exciting to me. Alright bottom line will you or won't you act? Well I. Yes or no? No. No Wendy's we all were needed that one. Alright then schedule your next seminar. That is an action. Perform it see where it leads you and in a moment to moment consideration what's right in front of you what excites you with integrity act and things will become more apparent. You mean it. Not sit still. You mean stuff in addition to the seminar because I only see the seminar as a small part of my career. Perhaps that will expand but yes I mean in addition to. In any given moment you get what you want there is a unique advantage in that moment find it act upon it that is all nothing to be bored of frustrated about. Alright yes I thank you. I say so. Thank you. As who you. What is the future of crime in this country over the next 10 to 20 years. Again a prediction is simply a sensing of energy it is nothing etched in stone there are infinite number of probable future. But in this moment sensing to directly answer your question you may find what you call escalation you will find what you generally will refer to as public reaction you will then find public taking back of responsibility you will find unity in action and eventually begin to see a transformation due to the mass intolerance of this type of expression. But also will you then begin to introduce empowering philosophy because individuals who so choose these types of violence and crime as you say do so from the sense of helplessness always no exceptions no matter what they say no matter how big the gun this is from a disempowered perspective. So in an overall viewpoint your willingness to walk as an empowered being gives that many more examples that many more opportunities for disempowered individuals to see that it is possible beginning to institute this into your educational system will eventually level this off and it will transform all together. You are your government and when you get in touch with that fact and act that way perhaps that will be one of the vehicles through which the answer will come but not the only one. Of course there will be involvement you will be just as key. You see a big change in our media and I guess for a moment TV as far as the violence that appears on TV. Absolutely. Hey we will find this to begin to tone down but not through a forcing through a choice through an understanding through having played out much of this idea and allow it to come to a conclusion. It will still be available as an option peripherally. That is one of the explorations in a world containing polarity positivity, negativism but it will become more and more peripheral. The second question now that the Hubble telescope has been apparently successfully prepared. What made your insight and changes about our view of the universe? Can you wait come out of that in the next five or ten years? Well one of the most shall I say more forthcoming observations will be the verification of phenomena you refer to as black hole. Perhaps in a more expanded point of view you will also begin to realize I will say this in a non-judgmental way. I am prefacing it this way on purpose. The absurdity of any boundary of a universe that is infinite. Perhaps there will seem to be an edge to the collection of individual galaxies but whereas there is perhaps you can say a notion that there is an end to space that particular notion will begin to dissolve. Infinity is truly infinity and finite expression exists within infinity not the other way around. Let me make a bold statement. Oh please do. We will the Hubble enable our assignment to come to the conclusion that our universe is no longer expanding but is indeed contracting. Not necessarily. You will find more of an eddy and flow rather than a uniform idea and perhaps though not through this particular instrument find there are other universes altogether. So you are seeking of a localized idea. Ultimately it would consider to be a localized effect. The expansion and contracting idea would not yet appear to be contracting though many individuals will say that it is. It will still seem as though an expansion is taking place because that is the nature of your consciousness. It is expanding. Where I heard all of that. You will also through shall I say the verification of the phenomena of black hole begin to make leaps and bounds in the field you know as quantum physics and vibrational mechanics. If you recall it was over at the Great Pyramid I believe a year ago that Philip put forth the idea that the universe is now contracting. That is again only observable in a localized way and is not ultimately perhaps in the way that you mean the asking of the question accurate. There are two ways to look at it. You are expanding your consciousness and therefore the physical expression also expands. On the other point of view you are also beginning to pull yourself back to understanding yourself as a singular source and being. So there will seem to be a contracted element to this. But what I am sharing would appear in your universe to be two completely opposite effects occurring and in your universe is the notion well it must be this or that. Most accurately both are recurring but it becomes impossible in that sense through the terminology available through the channel to explain how this is so. So perhaps you have approached one of the boundaries of our ability to translate and simply if you will envision to whatever degree you are able what I am saying you will have an intuitive understanding of it rather than an analytical one which presupposes again finite thought. Just to wrap this up then will the humble enable our scientists maybe to reach some drastically different views of the universe than they have now. Absolutely and this was one of the reasons for what you would call again the self-imposed obstruction of its vision because as is similar to your Mars probe example when it was quote unquote launched was not the timing. All right. Thank you very much. Andrew you as well. There will be but a few moments remaining to this interaction. Male. In the last session you said that you can communicate with us for the certain stances of our lives. Well communications from me may take place through certain circumstances not that I consciously say you will look here you will do that you have your complete free will but if there is something I wish to communicate if it is not received by you as a discrete thought communication you may experience the understanding or glean the intention that I have through the synchronicity of your circumstance. Does that make sense? Yes. Another question you said that what we call doubt is an unswording belief in something we don't prefer. Well in general doubt is not a lack of trust it is it's trust in the thing that you say you do not prefer in that situation that is one way to look at it. Okay I think of a lot of my doubt as being a belief that something I don't prefer might happen might possibly happen for example when I locked my doors at night I think that maybe there is a 1% chance that somebody will try and break in if I don't. I just wanted to sort of reconcile that view that I have of doubt to your statement that is a belief that something actually will happen. Well perhaps you can say might happen in a sense we are seeking semantics. It is the idea that a reality that you could prefer would even be possible to occur in your life and that is something that would occur in your life would be extraneous rather than absolutely that which would serve you. Now if you are positively oriented you will draw positive experiences as the reflection of that surface not negative. If you are beginning to view the possibility of the negative that gives you the opportunity to hone in on where you may still be vibrating and shall I say expressing negative. It is all a mivol. To be honest with you I live in a certain parts of the country I definitely locked my doors. But would you not in expressing who you are allow yourself to in that sense attract yourself to an area that would be reflective of who you are. So why would you then find yourself in such an area. Alright. A couple of quick questions. Would you say that you have mentioned tumultuousness natural to the others and what not. Would you say that there are more of them occurring now than at other times in the past. I have always sort of muted as being sure there is plenty of bad stuff happening but there are many cycles which would seem to be cyclical and take place on a certain timeframe because they are all asynchronous or not exactly in concert. There are portions in a physical timeline where many of them will seem to overlap again from a cyclical explanation in one concentrated area of time or period of timing. But again it is nothing that has not been happening the reason that it would seem fundamentally to be occurring in the same timeframe has to do again with the transformation of consciousness. So it is all interlaced you cannot remove one from the other unless you wish. My last question is if one were to form intentions that another person would change would that be would want to be successful in having that come about. It would be taking responsibility for them. It would be insisting that somehow though you wish to be who you are they should be someone else. They are who they are. Now in changing yourself you interact with them as the change so to speak the new choices self and any other individual that you are interacting with when you interact with them differently you get a different response. So there may be the effect that they change when you change but you cannot literally know change them nor would that even be the point nor would it even be a goal unless again you were assuming that they did not have the right and reason to be who they are. If you are assuming that they do not have the right and reason to be who they are in order for that concept to exist in your universe on some level you must believe that about yourself. So affording yourself again the unconditional love and the right and reason to exist as who you are will automatically have the effect of granting that to them as well. Does that make sense? Is it usable? Yes let's say thank you. Nice man. First of all welcome. And who you? You get your communication and I hope you communicate with you more often than excuse me. No need to hope. It will occur. You mentioned about 18 months ago that our national election would be our last national election. I mentioned the possibility that this may occur due to the fact that as individuals take responsibility you will no longer societally feel the need to relegate responsibility upon one individual. However, as I often share in terms of that a prediction is a sensing and that the prediction itself can actually alter due to the people being aware of it the outcome it would appear that the likelihood is that this no longer will occur yet. That we may want someone to do way of governing our child's trust and what we think is. Well this is fairly inevitable but in the timeframe again that has occurred it was not the timing at that point and we also by the way consider this to be quite positive. Tell me what you would do if we make confidence. Well eventually you will create what you call a global society but it will be again by the granting of the validity to the diversity not by the absorption and standing out of all unlike view points. As Sasani seems to have sort of a homogeneous society how long will it take it to get? Well again what we are saying as a 30 to 50 of your year shall I say timeframe is what we are referring to much of that. Now under Sasani we are only homogeneous in that we are synchronized to each other that we understand each other that we are linked perhaps what you could say telepathically but we are still quite individual to believe me when I tell you. So you do not lose your individuality by granting validity to the diversity you reinforce it and many times it is the fear of the loss of individuality that does not allow individuals to grant that diversity but it strengthens your individuality. Thank you very much. Thank you and lastly over there male. You're mine? No. Robert. As we agree to. I don't have a specific question I just wanted to tell you that I am beginning to live in the teachings and with incredible results. Oh first of all you are beginning to live what you know to be true for you with quite credible results. Thank you. Oh thank you. Particularly in work you mentioned something before several months ago. As you said again tonight and I wanted to reinforce that for anyone else who is not familiar with it the fact that the time you are the fact that you cannot if it's not happening the way you expected to because you can't appreciate how much better it can be for you. Well put. It's very much wanted to thank you. On that note there is nothing to be added however I understand that there are individuals out there who still have communications to make. This will not be our last interaction but it need not be that your particular perspectives are addressed in an interaction touches you may allow it to be if you wish but understand because you have the ability to understand anything I am saying if you are hearing words come out of the mouth of the channel and making sense of them. You are only doing so because you contain all this information. I am simply reflecting back what you wish to now begin to entertain and wish to express. But if it were new if you didn't contain it you would not understand it the channel's mouth would be moving and you would hear no words coming out that made any sense. What I am saying is you have the ability to access this information within you. For again I remind you I am simply a reflection from within you. Ask yourself these questions allow yourself to answer them to whatever degree you are willing from the most empowered perspective. If you still find you have a question then we will discuss it with you on whatever level is necessary but you contain it all trust your timing. If you wish I thank you for your willingness to co-create your reality with me this evening of your time I remain forever in what you call your dream reality I remain forever an unconditionally loving posture to you and your society and I thank you for the honor of representing me and my society. Boom!
