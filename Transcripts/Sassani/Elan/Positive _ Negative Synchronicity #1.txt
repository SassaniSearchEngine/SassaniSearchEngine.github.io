 Greetings this evening of your time as you create time, how are you? Oh, thank you very much. Allow me to begin this interaction with the entitlement, positive and negative synchronous instances. All right. All right. Thank you. Allow me to begin with the following idea which you may or may not have heard. Although you perceive yourself as the stink single being separate from your surroundings and within a reality. We again remind you that this is a self created appearance that perhaps you can say in fact the reality exists within you. And although there is the efficiency of all these separate ideas, everything fundamentally foundationally is all one thing. Many many facets of one expression, many many aspects of one event. And by the immutable nature and fact that this is one unbroken, continuous, singular event, everything within that one event that you call your reality is interwoven, is in that sense, in mesh. What you call coincidence is not accident or accidental, but it is all of the various incidences occurring at the same time. Same call, incident, incident says coincidence. Understand that because everything is all one expression, everything is related to everything else. From your point of view, there may be varying degrees of significance to you of any particular meaning. However, from the overall point of view, everything is all one thing. And because the definition of synchronicity is that everything is all one thing, an interwoven expression. Everything is synchronicity itself. Everything, no matter what. Therefore, synchronicity, the interwovenness of all creation is, in a sense, you may say, the rule, not the exception within it. Now your experience of the synchronicity, of everything as belonging, of everything as having a reason of everything as reinforcing your point of view, will depend solely on your particular choice of interpretation. The only thing that you need to do to realize positive synchronicity, which is a positive outcome, and perhaps an outcome you say you wish in that sense to experience, is very simply to allow yourself to be aware that everything is synchronicity. When you allow yourself access to this awareness, then you allow yourself a tool of realignment in any given moment. For if in a moment you say, why is this happening to me, you are in that sense affirming that your reality is a series of broken events rather than one expression. And therefore you get that effect. When you say, why is this happening to me, it continues to seem as though it is happening to you. But when you remind yourself that it is happening from you, it is you, and ask yourself how it is of service to you. You then take the synchronicity and interpreting it in a positive way, giving yourself the opportunity that synchronicity brings. For in every given moment there is a reason for absolutely everything within your perception, no exception, down to the dust on the leaf on the tree. In terms of you needing to be consciously aware of each and every meaning, this is not always so. And this is what I mean by relative degree of significance. Things which may not seem to have a direct obvious meaning to you do have a direct obvious meaning to someone else who is also creating through synchronicity the similar circumstance and the similar proximity to the event that you are beholding. So very simply this can be applied by first of all in any situation realizing that everything is synchronicity. Everything fits, everything has a reason, everything is there to be observant. And that again one step so to speak will align you to the positive synchronicity in the situation. The two very simply is act that way. If you truly say I understand that this is synchronicity then look at what actions that you can take with integrity because of the circumstance that the synchronicity has delivered to you. Okay, the very event that you may have before said why is this happening to me and now understanding that it is happening from you realize that there is something you can do because that circumstance has showed up. There is some action that you can take that you would not have been able to take without that particular circumstance popping up. That is in the same exact instance giving you the opportunity to either get a negative effect with the negative interpretation or a positive effect from the positive interpretation and subsequent positive action. Therefore everything is synchronicity. When you interpret that synchronicity through negative means as though it is happening to you your experience of that synchronicity will be negative synchronicity. And sometimes perhaps you can say one of the ways your society will define the perpetuation of negative synchronicity in your life is with the nomenclature you seem to refer to as bad luck which there is no such thing as. But when you accept synchronicity in that way and in fact then imbue it as a momentum imbue it also predicting that perhaps this is what you may continue to expect you create that negative synchronicity. You create the synchronicity that already exists and experience it through negative terminology. However you can always turn this around quite simply with a simple reminder that everything is synchronicity it is there for a reason. Now when you look for the reason either it will be immediately obvious because you have given yourself the opportunity to look at it or it may in that sense not be that obvious. That in and of itself tells you whether the meaning in that moment is relatively significant to you. If you say alright this would seem like a bummer and I understand it to be synchronicity what is this positive meaning what does it mean to me in a positive way and that meaning comes along then you needed to know the specific meaning but if it does not that as well as an indication tells you in that moment that you need not know that specific reason and perhaps it will become apparent later if you need to know it at all. But the point is if there is not a meaning forthcoming in a given moment you need not fixate upon obtaining one. You may understand that is the answer to the question that the meaning the specific meaning of that symbol is not at that moment in port and to you or it will be completely obvious is this clear. So therefore you need not struggle with these meanings they will either be completely apparent and then be of service through you through that apparently or it will not be that apparent but you can still align with the positive action to take in that moment understanding that you know that it has a meaning because you create yourself in linear terms whereby you do unroll your knowingness rather than having it all at once it seems as though you unroll it according to a timeline according to the particular coincidences current in that moment there are certain things which simply would not be who you to know the meaning of and knowing the meaning of it in that moment would actually be a distraction rather than an aid. So while that feedback to be completely obvious is there a meaning yes all right is there a meaning no all right no meaning I will keep my eye out in case the meaning pops up but I will not fixate upon that meaning for that then locks you into a loop where thereby you can create the appearance of negative synchronicity from fixating upon something and again assuming it to be extraneous not knowing something is just as meaningful as knowing it it is not if I know it it is perfect if I do not I'm flubbing it up it's extraneous no your reality is so obvious that if you do not need to know something that will be completely obvious and this is not always well understood if again you feel well it is something I would wish to know the meaning of then maintain as a clear intention I intend to discover that meaning and move on move on meaning act in that moment from what is available but to the degree that you are willing to begin to recognize synchronicity you then begin to be able to marvel in the splendor of your creatorhood for you literally do create it down to the sub atomic article and perhaps you can say even further and the complexity through which you create is in fact again the splendor of the life you call your reality so therefore nothing within that reality is extremely everything has a reason everything has a meaning and if you simply realign to that idea and act that way everything that we have shared with you simply falls into place perhaps you can say in many ways that most of what we have ever shared with you boils down to number one everything is synchronicity and number two act with integrity on the opportunities that synchronicity brings you therefore you can look at the many different interpretations that you have within your life in any given moment if you are in that sense interpreting through fear through anger through jealousy through ache then you are interpreting your reality through negative synchronistic terms if you interpret your reality through excitement through joy through unconditional love through willingness in that sense to be of service and be served you are then interpreting your reality through positive synchronous terms and this is the only change or shift in your perspective from your point of view that then allows you to experience one or the other now I remind you negative does not mean bad and positive means good that is one way to look at it but they are very general terms and again from our perspective negative is simply the energy of separation and positive is the energy of integration and in order to remain physical beings you must maintain some degree of separation so negative energy is part and parcel of what allows you to experience yourself as discrete and separate beings so there is nothing wrong with negative and in fact you can only be experiencing the very reality are creating right now through the use of that type and style of energy but what gives you negative or positive experience negative or positive happenings in your life can in that sense be altered by your actions for you can in that sense perform separative actions actions which do not in that sense take into consideration that everything is all one thing and then get the reinforcement of that idea which you will call negative synchronicity or you can simply understand again the one that the positive idea and upon assigning the positive label and the positive interpretation the positive orientation you will then perform the positive action and again it is the actions that you perform that will determine what you get the experience in your physical life so you need not forsake the negative and you may find in your synchronous exploration that you will find many other individuals who are exploring negativity what will allow them to enjoy their exploration and you to enjoy yours is your willingness to validate without condoning through your own actions their negativity they have the right just as much as you have the right to experience and explore anything you wish they have the right to explore negativity and as you expand you will become more aware of both but if you allow the awareness of negativity to simply be through the experience of others and allow the awareness of positivity to be your direct experience well why not that certainly is an option and many of you are beginning in that sense to delve into this idea therefore you may understand that doing what excites you the most from what is available in any given moment and acting on that excitement with integrity is in one sense you may say the ultimate acknowledgement of positive synchronicity and the ultimate acknowledgement of your willingness to act on that synchronicity and nice touch have a good time along the way for do understand that you do not have from this moment forward to continue to experience misery in your mind that also being an emotion is the result of a belief that you hold and your willingness to use your emotions not deny them not attempt to escape them which is impossible as you stand right now but use them to trace back the belief will allow you in that sense to transform that same belief and therefore the effect of that belief the so-called misery I want to stand also that what you call misery many times and also is simply the choice perhaps unconsciously but no left a choice of in that moment negative interpretation and you may experience what you call sadness or misery simply by in a given moment interpreting according to negative means interpreting things through in that sense a negative perception that belief that a negative thing can manifest in your life can in that sense in and of itself bring along the feeling that you call misery but your willingness to realign in a given moment reassign that everything is synchronicity and perhaps this is not the one exception in the universe will allow you in that moment to do something different it is when in the similar situation you do the same thing that that similar situation has the same effect or you have the same experience from it but the moment you do one thing differently even if you've already interpreted it negatively you cannot and not get the same effect it is impossible it is not the interpretation that gives you the experiential effect in your life the interpretation may give you the emotion but what gives you the experience in your life is the perspective that you act from is the perspective that you move or do from so even if you initially through perhaps old habits if you will interpret something as negative if you do not act in that moment if you allow yourself to remind yourself everything is synchronicity again perhaps this is not the only exception perhaps this is synchronicity too initially I had assigned it a negative label and I can see how I was about to do something that would definitely yield a negative effect however I am now in reminding myself that this is also synchronicity searching other options before I act what can I do that would be positive in my imagination what would the preferred me do not the me who just negatively interpreted this and was then about to react from that negative interpretation but the preferred me who did not even interpret it that way to begin with use your imagination along with the concept of synchronicity bring forth the referential preferential you the preferred you in your imagination and hand the situation over understanding that that preferred you that new you so to see is looking at it as synchronicity watch what that you does do that new thing rather than the quote unquote old approach and you cannot help no matter what but get a positive result across the board simply there is no such thing as an accident which is something that was not meant to be there may be the idea of having a particular intention and having that intention not quite play out the way that you would have perceived that it would and then you label it accidental but ultimately everything is co incident incident is occurring at the same time interwoven and one thing has absolutely everything to do with everything else nothing is unrelated so therefore it is no accident in that way that you are here this evening of your time interacting with us in this way it is no accident whatever it is that you will do next when you leave this interaction everything has a reason allow yourself to begin to be aware of the reasons where and when they present themselves and again if it is not completely obvious do not create paralysis but continue to move continue to move with excitement continue to move with the knowledge that even though I do not know the meaning I am reminded that this is synchronicity and therefore it is an opportunity a blessing in disguise for your willingness in that sense to interact with us in this way and for your willingness to allow us to express to you what you already know I thank you and ask you how I may be of service to you shut it hey female then may I when you were just talking about blessings in disguise I have been having a really hard time the last couple of months peeling away a lot of layers of hurt and anger and I have a lot of physical difficulties I have had headaches I have had intestinal grips and I have been getting really annoyed at this whole process both but I am beginning to see how it serves me and I come all the way back to two words and one of them one time you said the opposite of love is not hate but yes total self-invalidation what about shame the shame start a similar expression it is in that sense in general not the idea that you are aware that you have done something that you no longer prefer only but that you have done something that you no longer prefer and are in full judgment of yourself about so in a sense in a sense for this purpose they are interchangeable terms but the idea is this once you have done something understood and realized it is not something that you any longer wish to do that can be in and of itself the end of the process your resolve I will no longer do this particularly knowing how it then has you feeling we'll give you at some point perhaps an opportunity to create similar circumstances whereby you will have the opportunity to do that thing again and then the opportunity to subsequently choose not to do policy I have one more question we're planning to take a trip from Calgary Canada down to San Francisco from July 8th through about the 24th are there going to be any earthquake or I've been listening to a lot of predictions lately you know coming up for this summer will there be anything from Canada down to San Francisco on the California coast within that time from our particular understanding right now and do understand that this can change that will be a relatively quiet and I have one more question oh a while back it's taken me a long time to ask you about this because I didn't I wasn't sure well do understand it is the perfect time but you proceed about three months ago back before Christmas I woke up in the middle of the night and there was this bright white light in the room with me and I felt like I remembered what you said about any time I hear something or see something to open my eyes this time and see what I saw and the white light to stay there I didn't have any particular forum was about three feet long and about a foot wide and it felt I felt very safe with the light but from my waist down it felt like I was totally paralyzed tingling and electrified and I couldn't move at all but there are reasons to be needing to move no well maybe maybe I was trying to stay in the situation and run away at the same time that's what it felt like and so I watched it and I had to be for about 10 minutes and I thought well shut my eyes and see if it's still there and when I shut my eyes I could see like zeta faces with the black eyes you know all all in front of my face and when I opened them it's like all these little heads were looking at me right in my right in my face about six inches away but very friendly I mean they seem like I had invited them there or something oh which I would like I intend to do that today I would really like to be able to reach out and invite them instead of just being so scared and hoping they won't show up when I can't handle that kind of thing was that something that I just created in my higher self to test my own self to see if I was ready yet well it was a co-creation therefore it would be perhaps you can say an accurate to say that they were not involved but in many ways perhaps you would define it as being more of a mental projection than the physical presence so in that sense that is their form of allowing you to get your little away they know this is the time to do what I'm dreaming I remember in my dream I was concentrating on doing something very hard and there was a huge head of a dog right next to me snarling and growling and I remember thinking to myself I can't do this if you're watching me I have to I have to be by myself and that's when I woke up and I saw the white light in all the little faces so I just wondered how am I attracting them to me or well it is a co-creation of timing it is subsequently yours and their timing at the same time then it occurs the dog in the dream which is very strongly the symbol of service itself in a sense was nudging you in that direction a wake-up call of thought okay thank you very much oh thank you ma'am and who you cave dwellers thank you happy birthday oh that's on level and you all that's one yeah okay all right um I have some uh a small example of uh song for this negative synchronous thing oh no example too small yeah right but it's interesting because I got in my my truck tonight and I turned the lights on and it didn't come on and I've been driving around with a single headlight for the past week or so you know and I thought oh god you know I'm not supposed to go tonight or you know this is some sort of a message to me that I should stay at home but um as I turn the high beams on one single light would come on as a high beam so uh I continue to drive here and uh you know I decided to uh change it into more of a positive idea that I'm a single bright light more and that's uh I'll take it at that and I'll get a fix you know that's your perseverance was part of the point as well yeah not allowing your external reality to talk you out and remaining at all times in light I have a few question comments how many about allow us you can find it to one or two and then we will return okay well well it's about the birth experience that I've experienced in the past few weeks oh and uh it was a beautiful birth right thank you and uh I'm uh the sharing is of course too much to share at this point right now but it was a beautiful experience and I was blown away by the Christ like spirit that was there well hope you are an expression each and every one of you of that mind therefore its brilliance cannot overcome you simply illuminate more of yourself and again I remind you that that individual did not come down and say anything about follow me and everyone else is in the garbage you know that you are all sons and daughters of God as well I am simply a living example and should you choose to embody that so will you be do proceed that's exactly what I got you're not mean to rain on the parade you know that's that's why I should definitely receive you know I it's I was saying I am Christ you know basically I don't even wake up at those but I am I was saying that I concluded the idea is you need not say it and then exclude that everyone else is as well one of the fullest expressions of understanding the Christ within each and every individual is the willingness to reflect that Christ in each and every individual one of the shall I say part and part will tell tale signs of any true master is that they are only willing to treat you as a master as well not take your power for a master needs no power they understand they have their own power so a true master will be the first to reflect back to you that you are a master as well thereby enabling your headlight to become a beacon as well so all of us here are the heart of the second coming and that is what we have shared that it would not be through a single individual but the emergence of that spirit which was the purpose of what you call the life of Jesus within each and every individual and one of the expressions paradoxically of this emergence in each and every individual is the willingness to accept every other individual's taste rate and timing which may in that sense also mean accepting those who choose not to express any portion of that and remain completely steep in negativity that is their choice your job so to speak is not to change anyone's mind it is to simply live what you know to be true and attract the individuals who will also benefit from that and then hand them the whole thing not a withhold not putting them in a dependent situation and along those lines I had visions of the earth and far far away I saw the earth I saw this moving blue veil around the earth it was a protective veil well it is the electromagnetic field of the earth it need not be thought of in terms of protection from the perspective that you need to be protected since there is no outside there is nothing out there to protect yourself from and the mentality of setting up a protection is the same thing as setting up the attack remember you are all one thing there is not a protection in here and an attack out here everything's within you so setting up protection is the same as saying I believe an attack is imminent yes I I say protection but obviously choice of words yeah simply utilizing the advantage of bringing that and I became aware and concluded that that I am the earth that I am such a part of mother earth and that we all are and that Christ consciousness exists in the embodiment of the earth absolutely beautiful it also will seem to exist what you call enveloping the earth as well what you call your mass consciousness will in that sense seem to be both enveloping the earth and at the same time encompassing it and within it one expression every planetary body no matter where no matter when is in some way linked to consciousness there is no such thing as an completely unconscious planetary body they are expressions of consciousness different definitions than what you define yourself to be but understand again from our perspective everything is consciousness different density or densification but consciousness no less down to a rock right and and it's interesting how Kim and I asked for assistance with many others to be there and and I sense that there was someone missing and I had to truly find that that missing part and it then it dawned on me it was Christ well no interesting no no it is the Christ within you and in a sense you may say perhaps more appropriately it is you factor yourself in then nothing will ever be missing that's really interesting oh thanks beautiful and then real quick I just your presence you as a sign presence there with very moving and it was a celebration and I'm I'm still dabbling around as far as answers on how they were coming to they were coming in curiosity to see the newborn and I'm not real clear about that but I accepted it as a as a newborn on esosanis I'm not sure but that's how I accepted it and uh and also what according to what would happen after that but that was a beautiful it was very close to the in physical to me and we were in a we were flying at that point and what was happening well you have just told you are in that sense tapping in to what you would call probable future that can become definite future if you should in that way choose that future understand again that there are an infinite number of probable futures and it is not so much what is going to happen what is the future but which one will you choose through your interpretations and subsequent actions and when him left the room and I was there alone all the beings have left it was dark I felt the ground universe again which was a beautiful experience and uh really realizing that I have come home and um and then all of a sudden I felt a presence come in the room to my lower eyes towards my feet and uh I came up with Pira which are some sort of female I said sorry and I felt like she was there just to say thank you very quickly for my participation in the birth so what is that the idea that will be in that sense most useful is to understand that conceptually no matter what you experience what you created was a birth within your present physical self use that childness use that reborn freshness in the actions of your life from this point forward and then you will be creating through your life through your deeds the actions that will reflect a vibration that will attract you to that literal future for now that will be is that understood yes oh I really understand all of it uh bring it back home as you think although it is all well and good perhaps a bit fun perhaps a bit romantic to explore the heaven through your consciousness as we have always shared keep your feet on the ground bring it here do not theorize about a heaven to go to create that heaven on the earth with your feet firmly on the ground that's exactly what has happened thanks and that is what will continue to happen if you continue to allow yeah and it's been beautiful i feel empowered i feel it's action i need action i want to take action i'm really ready to go and to move and and it has been so balanced and smooth oh a quick review then if a circumstance should come along from this point forward which would seem to not jive with the new you what will be your new attitude based on what you have learned in this interaction nothing can defeat me that's how i used to look at how about everything is synchronicity this is perhaps not the only exception therefore i will act upon this opportunity that synchronicity has brought i don't see how negative synchronously can be in my life anymore oh then it will not or it will not have that effect and any effect that you have gotten from negative actions in the quote unquote past now that you are willing to even interpret those effects as positive changes or turns them right around from this point forward you create a new moment we thank you yeah sure hey three minutes so what Jim was sharing i have a question because i would deal with him when he was and i knew that my experience of it was that his soul and his cries that he was coming in and that was merging into the era but i at the same time also was on the ship with him and me and i felt and i didn't think and everybody didn't know if i was making it up but i thought all the essence on the side your higher self is making up your physical self your life is the result of the imagination of your higher self to begin that is why in that sense i said that you proceed um so i experienced the esophonic being all around and i experienced that going on the ship and i saw a baby being born and i experienced a big party and everybody was on the right and i saw you and from the shore and um aliosa and um and kira and it was wonderful but like he said it it was there but it was also here it was to be here on the earth it wasn't just about going to esophonic but it well since you did in that way create that discrete co-creation experience with us allow me to ask you a few questions did you first of all notice and by the way for those of you who may be new to these interactions esosani would be the nomenclature of the planet that i come from and they are speaking about interacting in meditative states with various beings from my society did you notice upon the birth upon the physical birth that there was not what is called pain to the mother during the birth process there wasn't an option very awake and there and part of it and did you experience the joy the flowingness the allowing yes the lack of resistance the lack of friction did you notice in that sense what you may call the lucidity of the newborn not in that sense held upside down and stanked on the bus not in that sense into the world crying though there was the process of breathing initiated did you also notice in that sense lack of what you would call umbilical cord well we no longer in that sense have that expression for the exchange in what you call colloquially the wound is by direct electromagnetic transport and not by a light electrochemical means therefore that particular symbol no longer exists upon our planet and we therefore do not enjoy what you call belly bacham is there anything else yeah well i had but it was very beautiful when he asked me that did you that he'll know i just said yes i'm i'm supposed to be here with you with very synchronous oh perhaps a midwife of course yeah it felt like but more for his benefit for you will understand that that symbol in that individual choosing to create the birth process upon our planet is completely self-empowered is not necessary there are no hospitals there are no doctors one of the reasons i asked you these questions was to share with the many of you who are synchronistically attending this interaction that you too can experience the birth process in this way and it is what you have been taught to expect and the investment that you make in fulfilling that expectation that creates what you consider to be the pain during the birth process and subsequently sometimes the need to actually surgically extract the fetus rather than in that sense the natural process but as you begin to get in touch with this process as being natural as you begin to view it as an allowance rather than a forcing and perhaps a slightly new perspective to many of you as you begin to understand that the soul that you will be midwifeing into physical reality has as you have all led many other lives and is not a quote unquote infant mentality you may understand that you can begin direct communication with the soul to be born prior to the birth process and when you do this and literally enlist the aid assistance and help of the child itself you can experience painless birth therefore thank you for the opportunity to expect that you can't get the right answer to that question. Oh, what? Well, I wanted to share I went to Atlanta and I was going to go and I had a great time and I know you mean to tell me you actually went and had a great time. Oh my. What a surprise. I was concerned about making money there or seeing clients and I ended up seeing 16 people and had a term, 60 people away. Oh, how about the other thing or person that you were concerned about? Well, I'm in love. All right. I mean, it was great. It was great. I never felt this way in my life and that's sort of another person. What you call the doubt or the negative trust what did you learn about that? Well, in going down there wasn't that term? What you call some negative anticipate? Yeah, there was and I keep having I keep I had to keep clearing that constantly it would even when I was there it would come up and I'd have to ask myself what am I choosing to believe and I was seeing some veils in the past and I'd have to keep reminding myself of what you know I said before about that the president was an experientially of the past so that I kept clearing it and when I'd clear it then I'd be present and then I'd be happy. All right, so what's happening now that since I've come back is I've seen this going into a very big contraption and I've been crying a lot and and you know I don't like my life and said you know I had a move you know and I know you know I know like I've talked to him a lot and and I wanted to go back down there and I'm afraid again you know I've got just another special at the airline. All right. Well you can pay as much as you wish. I thought that. So special at the airline. So I'm going to call him up and I guess I'm again I'm going back to the fear holding back again and I'm it's causing me a lot of pain again. Well do understand that you are showing yourself in no uncertain terms just how much power you have for even knowing all that you know you will always have the choice and opportunity to choose the negative. This may on the surface seem like a curse. It is in fact a blessing for it shows you that no matter what you will always have 100% complete choice. Simply understand that you are now seeing a pattern to the positive outcomes of your willingness to act in the positive way and allow that momentum to continue to reinforce itself through your willingness to do these things. Yeah I guess the fear keeps coming up and the negative beliefs keep coming up. I have been to not to let them be and not act on them and I keep doing the positive but it's really I'm tired. Well question when the negative comes up do you say not now which effectively pushes it back into the closet or do you say all right negative emotions have your way really have your way with me. I will express you go on give me all you got. This is key allowing yourself to feel what you have created a belief creates an emotion allowing yourself to have that emotion allows you to access the belief. Squelching that emotion and acting on the opposite may temporarily give you a different effect but that squelching does not allow the allow yourself to dive into the feeling. You will get to the point where you do say now what I have done it it is done now what then ask yourself what must I have deleted. Then when the belief comes forth say I do believe that it is not something I prefer but I believe it then give yourself the alternative giving yourself the alternative in complete acknowledgement is slow and choice giving yourself the alternative in complete denial is exhausted. You only resist yourself so the minute that you decide or the second or microsecond that you decide to allow yourself there is no exhaust. Exhausted tiredness that type of idea is only and perhaps again this will be an assistive reminder from resistance of your flow and resistance of your ecstasy it is exhausting to be through you or not therefore through the whole time. I would just say if I really went into the feeling that I can't lock it feels so overwhelming. They ask you a question so what where are you going to go there is no outside there is no inside there is nowhere to go if you get lost and you are the only thing left you are not lost. Therefore understand again that there is nothing nothing nothing that you can create within your reality that can overcome you and the timing for having created something is blatant evidence that that is the perfect timing for the doing of that thing otherwise you would be creating things which were extremely which had no meaning which had no reason and as we have discussed everything has a meaning and we oh have a good time have a strange thank you. Over there. One moment ma'am. Does the economy have one or two degrees of a different laboratory rate against the disease and the medicine that the planet will act as custodians of the planet where we are within the planet what I would call planet data. Excellent understand that in certain sense I do not mean decor wise or layout wise in many ways as a sunny our planet would be the grand central station of our region we in that sense have a germane population we are also perhaps you can say in contact with many of the quote unquote forces that you have discussed but we also have a plethora a portion perhaps you can say of our population that is made up of both individuals from other planetary societies visiting and individuals from many other societies in car nading and for rarely sometimes for a full lifetime sometimes for several full lifetimes and sometimes for several hours days or weeks so therefore there is a very transient idea within our society our permanent six population colloquially speaking would be between perhaps 200 and 250 million and the many other millions would be comprised of these other beings it's my experience that this planet has two beings who dwell within the planet of a different entities in ours well actually there is an infinite number when you speak of discrete beings on your wavelength in the vibratory reality that you define as your reality were we from our spacecraft to scan your planet yes we would find two sentient populations one of them is your land you man the other would be your water the station's dolphin wave our perspective they possess a similar type of sentient as you do with the ability of self reflection with what you sometimes call telepathic ability and with the ability to in many ways though they are more emotionally based reason to a certain degree I am talking about it being the complete the different density like a being in the sun a being in the sun is a being has a consciousness the moon has a consciousness the earth itself has a consciousness that is comprised of a single female and single male asset that are maybe perhaps I don't know the density levels the density five or seven or six a completely different density level then the two and the two species that you were discussing they act as as it were as custodians of the planet and caretakers of the planet as you can see in the sun where the sun has a being existed a different density or different vibratory level than the humans do or you like the sun is how we understand can you verify that are there beings like that on the planet of exisciences you know well there is a similar idea there is less separation drawn from us in how we relate to it for instance in my interacting with you I would understand what you are calling your earth consciousness to also be part and parcel of your own consciousness simultaneously both and in matter facts all consciousnesses of all living things upon your planet and at the same time a discrete self-aware being as you are similar to what you call all that is all that is or god is everything all at the same time and can perceive as everything simultaneously but at the same time it can perceive itself as a singular discrete individual for as you are made in perhaps you can say the image and likeness of god since you possess the quality of self-awareness and individuality that has to in that sense the equality of all that is so therefore there are similar relationships from planet to planet perhaps we do not necessarily break it down as discreetly as you do in terms of separating it out into literal beings we more would look at it from the overall consciousness standpoint with which again there is not truly a separation even between your own consciousness but from the perspective that you are sharing what you are saying I understand and there is that effect yet so in the evolution of a soul for example I mean a soul is my experience this soul walking around in the human body of absurd entities or whatever the moment lecture is could have been and in some cases have been the soul of a star the being in the sun or could have been on this planet there are souls walking around that have experienced lives and other entities lives that other vibratory rates very vastly different vibratory rates than the third and the third and the third and the third and now and have come back to exist within the third level of density to relate back to that level from a different point of view that is absolutely one way to look at it and and something that I'm growing with is you mentioned that um your your planet being like a grandfist or station um the the council the council of the ascended masters this is a white brotherhood the blue the council that complies with different colors that work on different levels that all come together to be um the white brotherhood of the ascended masters or that level of functioning uh that on this planet when this planet first awakened when soul first came to this planet uh to engage in this experiment and in free will and total choice and and lack of direct connection to the the whole universe where we were separated we lost our connection from the universe to experience this this kind of free choice that we have and disconnected it um that there were there was a council an original council circle was wide to tend here to awaken on this planet and that and that this council needs to reconvene that there needs to be a reconnection of these ancient souls who have been here for the duration uh in awakening on this planet that's going on right now does this make any sense to me well again that is one way to look at it but again doesn't play certain degrees of separation now what you consider to be these councils which would appear from your point of view to be a hierarchical structure first of all in general would represent a regulating frequency or pulse more than an actual council and from their perspective there absolutely is no hierarchy there is a complete equality so sometimes in using the verbiage that you have chosen there are certain connotations which we will not necessarily agree with it is far shall i say more loose than you might imagine there is no this or that that needs to happen in order for there to be a complete transformation what in general will occur is as that happens that will simultaneously just automatically occur any of the regrouping any of the reunions any of the checking in in order to in that sense again perhaps you can say overseas but because you do have complete will there is no shepherding going on real you actually are your own free will soul so these are statements and expressions and to some degree do occur but nothing is necessitated on their recurrence does that make sense it's beautiful for the scientists to be um we started to talk about this uh the first time we communicated um the idea that as at this time third entity souls existing in third entity bodies as we live on the planet of the density of planet exists you indicated that um we can be free of other activity and i think you also indicated that we can be free of the mass consciousness that as as souls as individuals we can be free of the mass consciousness that we exist with well you can be free from any your main seeming negative experiential reality that you would feel is part and parcel of the mass consciousness you will be in contact with it but it contains the complete plethora of negative and the complete plethora of positive so from within that soup should you choose in that sense to embody the positive then the negative portion of the mass consciousness will still be there but that will not be the portion that you seem to interact with and it will make little or no sense to vow those choosing to experience and to create positive so in other words again as you expand you are more aware of negative and positive how is this possible one may ask it is possible that your actions will choose what you experience but you will still be aware of all the rest so if you choose positive actions positive interpretation you then get positive experience in 100 proportion but your expanding awareness of negativity for instance it does exist within its reality as an option will be through observing others who are choosing to experience that negativity so you do not escape the mass consciousness you are still in that sense connected to it but you are embodying one portion of it thereby having another portion be somewhat irrelevant to your experience so there's not getting rid of it is a shifting of empathy a shifting of perspective okay there's one so this is the my life to explore you touched on this before when we talked about protection it seems to me that what's going on the planet in my connection with the custodians of the planet and with all of the species that live on the planet is that there is in some kind of sense i don't understand a loss of protection that whole species are no longer able to cope with their environment and the things that they were harmless to them before have wiped them out that the earth has the ozone layer the earth has the soil the earth has the water and all of these things are are losing their their their vital strength because of the of the pollutants and the things that are affecting chemicals the things that are affecting the planet and that there is in some sense a protective mechanism that is weakening the aid is you know the immune system of people is being attached and and this this understanding this you know i don't you know in light of what you said about you know there is no protection of we don't need protection that we are all one which i understand i don't understand this phenomenon it is my experience that this planet is under duress well do understand again that everything will be in your experience the product of your interpretation now one way to look at what you call diminishing ozone is yes there is less of the protective aspect of the atmosphere another way to look at diminishing ozone is that you are now ready and able as a society to absorb that much more energy directly from your central gun the individuals who decide my protection is gone again create the attack and create in fact their protection being gone they get that prophecy fulfilled those who understand that the opening of your ozone can also be likened utilizing again the analogy of the consciousness of your planet as the opening of the crown chakra of your planet itself and therefore the timing of it meaning that that must be the timing whereby you can now in that way interact with that much more of the energy of your son that person who makes that designation has a completely different attitude walks around differently interact with the sun differently get a different effect all of these things exist and it is simply a matter of what you emphasize in here in the whole species has been going on throughout your history prior to what you call humans upon your planet in roughly the same proportion as is occurring now do you have any data or information on a possible major shift in the oblique routine of our planet other planets in our solar system go through major shift in their angle towards towards the sun and we are we don't do that our planet doesn't do that because well it has it has its own has but in the reasons have the moon has held the planet stable right but there is what you call a particular wobble to the spin of your earth you refer to as percessions which actually along approximately a 26 000 your cycle will actually slightly change the tilt of that angle if what you are asking is will there be a polar physical shift no not in your foreseeable future there are from time to time electromagnetic shift which in that sense maintain the position physically of the planet and simply are a reversal of what you call the pole which then result in a plethora of shall I say phenomena if we were to look at this as a being and we were to assign a density to that being that the sun has our thumb in our solar system then you would only be interacting with the portion of that being in that density for it is transcendental and exist within all the density simultaneously you would simply be singling out as a prism one way for as we all do however we are we we get mostly inhabit these bodies well not technically speaking from your point of view but from the point of view of your higher self this is but a mere wink in the eye of the life of yourself oh thank you you created it all okay at this time we will pause for a short break to be determined the length by you and resume contact at that point
