 Greetings, this evening, how are you? Fine, feeling, feeling good and I'm happy to be here. And as well, it is always our dearest pleasure in that sense to interact with individuals in your society, not only as a collective, but also individually. As you do create in this reality the unique perspective of your version or style of individuality. And as we in that sense become more aware of just that many more ways that what you call God and we call all that is, expresses itself throughout the multiverse. That expands us, or we understand that we contain it all. Therefore, in a sense you can say that our motives are in that way somewhat selfish. But it is our pleasure in the process to share with you what has worked for us, never once again with in insistence that it is any better than what you are doing. But as an alternative, sensing that you both again collectively and individually are beginning to request this style of forthcoming from within you. Again, I remind you as always that you can only perceive a reality at all if you first contain the definition within you to make sense of what is happening. So therefore anything that you perceive you already contain, anything that you feel in that sense has come to you as a revelation or a flash of awareness still could only have done so if you first contain it. So understand that my job as you call it, we do not have jobs in that way, but is literally as a mirror, a reflector. And therefore it is my pleasure to reflect back to you whatever is determined by me to be of assistance to you. I simply ask that where you already know something that you share it as fully as you are with it, for understand, telepathy or what we call telepathy functions along the path of least resistance. And if in that sense you know something, there is really no need for me to know it necessarily. You already have the information, it has already been delivered in the path of least resistance. So if you are willing to share the totality of how far you have come regarding a certain issue or perhaps question in this format. Then should there be other information from within you which again would be moved you to look at, then it is available for us to reflect in that way. But if you already know it once again, then it is not necessary necessarily for me to know it. Sometimes I will, sometimes though I simply will not. Very often in your reality you will find that your scientific community in that sense will endeavor to quote unquote test psychic ability. But understand when they do so in the form of asking for instance a particular psychic what they had for breakfast that morning and then in that sense assuming the psychic will know what the ask or add for breakfast. The asker already knows what they have and it simply is not important for the psychic to know that. So very often the test that seems to invalidate psychic functioning simply do not take into consideration the actual mechanism. We thank you for your willingness in this sense to interact with us on a one to one or perhaps you can say one to many or there are shall we say the availability of many others on my end and ask you in that way to allow your imagination to provide the format for the unfoldment of this interaction for it will never fail you. And as you are willing to exercise so to speak your imagination you strengthen a tool that you can never lose and in that sense will always function for you no matter whether someone else is around to reflect or assist you or not. So therefore allow that imagination to be valid and trust not only the repurrential prepurrential you that in that sense will show you but also trust methodologies or processes which would seem in that sense to fulfill your exploration and enable you to begin once again to unfold according to preference. We thank you. What do you wish to discuss? I thought I would make it easy on myself and kind of draw down things. Oh, you may wish also to allow for some sponge today as he as well. Therefore you will get what you see. I started writing I feel privileged and much honored for this opportunity and then I said and I want to express my desire for friendship. I have I mean friendship I have heard an idea about friendship but one thing that this was it most is no matter what friendship I use that word to have friendship on earth or with human beings but maybe that's something that I want to see and I have few questions written down in certain order and if we go through those words maybe you can change the format if you wish for. But we will allow it to unfold and you can use your own parameters as you wish. Also understand again from our point of view that you are our friend and do understand that in that sense we endear and feel endearment from all that we interact with in a sense consider all to be friends so that will simply be automatic. And in that sense completely perhaps somewhat sometimes unlike many of your human relationships but completely unconditional you cannot lose that therefore proceed and we can. Before anything else I kind of want you to express the feeling maybe it's just my feeling but I still want to get that out of the way. Well you need that prayer that is just my little feeling for it is something to you therefore it is something to us for we have attracted to interact with you. In any sense at all is there any karma between us do you have any heart feelings against me I mean I know you are beyond it all but I always say you were anxious to end your answer to me as if you rather not speak to me or were not interested in conversing with me much. Is there anything more to it than my perseverance that way. Now from my perspective absolutely nothing to it at all. It is simply your perspective it is my joy to interact with you but I have found in interacting with many individuals from your society that regardless of my intention in the interaction that they will interpret to some degree the interaction from their perspective. So therefore understand it is again an honor and joy to interact with you and we never in that sense provide any more or any less than we feel in a given moment would appropriately address the question as asked and understand very often individuals will have the need for clarification but not then ask for it. So to the degree that you are willing to explore and be specific with the acting of the questions that is a degree to which we can answer them. Also you will find in general and this is particularly more due to the channels mentality than my own is that the interaction will function more efficiently. If you ask questions shall we say one at a time rather than one question containing many questions for you will find again in a sense a degree sometimes of this connection through the channel and therefore perhaps not get what you perceive to be a complete answer. So therefore be succinct in that way and allow each question to stand on its own. So I want to ask you something that is quite frustrating as far as communicating with you is concerned so it kind of connects with what you just said. So please tell me how this can be helped. I asked you before if you could read my mind. Usually much is behind that one question and it's difficult to put everything in words so I was wondering if it were possible that we could just communicate tele-particularly instead or if you could read my mind and take the whole thought process into consideration while giving an answer. That's the problem. Well there is a possibility perhaps you can say in due time for that amount of trust to be developed between you and again to some degree the channel for he is for all intents and purposes a middle man and therefore perhaps you can say whatever limitations he will choose to express will bind me to some degree. However if you are willing in that sense to share what you can in words which he as a human understands that I can then translate the meaning from that the intentions behind your words will be quite evident too. But at this point you're still talking about going through the channel not how about doing it. Well I have in that sense perhaps invited you to do so but that will be in your own time in your own states and your own meditative space. We can absolutely connect directly in that one. I want to use an analogy to describe the journey of any one soul and just kind of share it with you. Oh how excited please do. I have been with beats representing each lifetime and then something that I have realized recently is that just like the stream goes through all these there is this internal travel that happens. So any one beat has access to the wisdom gained in any other lifetime is that true. With some degree though from our perspective you would have many parallels strands of bees also then connecting shall we say horizontally and that would explain why some particular bees have connections that seem to not occur with other particular It is shall we say a bit more complex than the single string of big theory but you may understand that each of the beads in that sense is as a shiny mirror or ball bearing and therefore contained on the reflective surface there of does contain all other So if I'm trying to get in touch with my higher self I don't know what other words to use but to do that is it possible that I don't know how it is. Well perhaps we can assist you for understanding the way you are speaking of it the way you are concepting it draws from the point of view that you are separated from your higher self and need to re establish a connection and a connection in and of itself is a bridge between two separate points and you need not in that sense define yourself as separate from your higher self but understand you are an expression of your higher self and then consult you within that corresponds to that expression without drawing the distinction. You need that connect to it you are it and when you are it and say you must connect to it you create a seeming gap that then needs to be bridged. Does that make sense. I know this is in theory but okay now the next question is going to make sense but understand what you think in theory but the separation. I would like to ask you help in understanding a major conflict or a reason man I mean this is really strong I have been struggling with this for the last three years. This reason man I have over the issue of higher self choosing certain life experiences and then the way I see this on the lower self having to go through them kind of being a victim. That is only one way to look at it however for what you are perhaps speaking of is the free will of the higher self which perhaps decides in the most general of terms that you will explore certain overall ideas. It does not in that sense plan for you to experience those general ideas and either positive or negative terms so one analogy that we have used is perhaps with the hall I am speaking of representing an event and not an actual hallway or place but perhaps your higher self will say well you will walk down this particular hall meaning you will have this particular exploration come to your awareness but how you walk down that hall is completely up to you. You can slink or mop down the hall with your head hung low or you can skip or run or ride down the hall or get created put on roller skates fill the hall with water swim down the hall freeze the water ice gate down the hall. The experience of the positive expression or negative expression of the overall exploration is the free will of the physical self therefore should you choose from your physical perspective to only interpret and therefore then feel think and act according to your positive interpretation then no matter what the specifics are you will never sense it as a negative you will never sense it as something having happened to you and then perhaps need to trace something that you have quote unquote done either earlier in this life or in another life to justify why such a negative experience is happening all the while assigning that you are within a cycle that is beyond your meaning karma is completely self-imposed and when you impose it yet it had the effect you are sharing but there is no overall shall we say counsel or judge that sits in judgment of you all that it is completely unconditional where the conditional love comes in is your society love of self you impose the conditions and then when you do not meet them you judge yourself and when you judge yourself you create a particular action which then usually creates an effect which you then say well see I got what I deserve but had you when you realize perhaps that you have done something that you did not prefer rather than judge yourself about it cut yourself the same slack or respect that all that is does and say this must serve me and look at how it serves me your actions will be different you will not get the what you consider to be retribution style of karma for the idea of perhaps karma most overall is that simply balance there will be but the assignment of what constitutes balance or the imposition that balance must come retribution style is completely up to you and many of your religions as they create a hierarchy within them will simply withhold this one minor fact and I say that perhaps you can say facetiously until perhaps you can say one reaches what they consider to be the higher levels of awareness but it is our perception that any of your society could plainly handle now the idea that you create the cycle that was a form perhaps you can say of control that they intended in that sense to inflict upon the masses do you understand? okay so this gap I know I shouldn't feel any gap and I don't sometimes I don't but I don't like the fact that I don't know why things are happening in certain way and what was the lesson I was supposed to learn and the worst feeling is the lesson is not for master but for the higher again I know all you what you said but it's as if it is using me or without letting me in on the plan that well one of two things will occur either it will when you ask and you must pass you must decide to take back your power how does this serve me exactly as it is either something will come up and you can look at that or perhaps and not very often but sometimes nothing will come up then but that does not mean that you then must lose your trust that you will find out why sometimes it is in folded within the timing to not know at that moment and then certain things play out you change your actions because of something that happened and then you see then why thank goodness that it happened but also understand as you begin to assign positive meaning and clean how it is of service to you and when it isn't obviously a parent still be in willing to trust in it and keep acting from that center you no longer act in a way that generates more of the quote unquote negatively you change the life you are not constantly going through life redefining things according to preference which perhaps on the surface truly are not preferable it is only a first when you shift your perspective away from perhaps you can say creating half consciously and half unconsciously that you begin to replace the negative seeming effects with positive effects but it takes your decision in a moment to say enough is enough from this moment forward I will only clean positive meaning if it is not immediately obvious I will assume that something will turn up it did not happen for no reason I do not know the reason now alright put that aside what is right in front of me these things which excites me this one can I act on it with integrity yes and you are once again back into motion and the reason if again you do not know it immediately which most of the time you will will become obvious and when you allow this to happen then perhaps you can have the evidence that will reinforce the trust that you always will find out at some point it seems like such a basic common sense but individuals allow themselves to be pushed off center anytime they finally say well I will not accept my full power and I am using this external situation as the excuse or reason but you need not to understand also this the most profound the most profound expansive changes will occur from the simplest of notion if you enter it saying that so simple that I should consider myself an idiot for not having thought of it then you are missing the point the point is that thank goodness perhaps you can say you have finally realized just how simple it is for reality or shall I say the creation of reality consciously is simple though the reality that you create within has richness diversity and complexity the mechanisms for being met are extremely simple because all you have to do is be and trust and see what's there and act upon the one that excites you the most with integrity and every other thing that we have sharing all falls into place from merely that right and this time of just saying and maybe that kind of cancels out my question but still I want to talk about this because you'll see why maybe would you have any comments about what lesson I'm supposed to have learned from the fact that I was given this need that's how it feels like this place need to be loved and the reality that it didn't seem to happen I understand about self-love well not really last time the point is if you really understood about self-love you would understand that you bought into a package or a set of beliefs at a young age perhaps partially due to perhaps you can say the approach of your particular nationality in that sense did you feel you are in a loving and nurturing environment I think you'd have to do with my mother not my nationality my mother doesn't like me and I think I've been really unblowing to go to for me but can you now realize your value despite whatever her opinion is and this is the issue of self-love what I am telling you is that no matter what she said or felt she was wrong now are you willing to adopt that attitude and paradoxically perhaps when you do you will feel what I am saying rather than simply have it be an analytical concept that sounds good but you need not buy into what you perceive she felt she felt that is simply one neutral set of props but you then buying into it believing it is the other set of props and if an individual truly feels that the only way they can have love is externally and they're perhaps initial primary source of that was lacking then it explains what you have bought into it do you understand? yes I've thought a lot about it and I feel like I have a lot of self-confidence and I know that you understand that she was wrong yes I really went around now can you go one step further and have it be alright that she felt that if she is going to invalidate you all well and good but you are going to go one step further and not invalidate do what you perhaps wish she had done with you then you will really feel good about yourself perhaps the ultimate form that this can take is actually being willing to thank her for having done that for what it has allowed you to discover within yourself the strength that it has forced you to come to terms with within yourself and the self-love which you will grant yourself completely unconditionally has come directly from that interaction I think I have done that around the age of 30 or whatever I forgot but now I did realize and I changed and I feel good about myself and all but that's the thing that is this question I just want it about but this is not about self-love it's about sharing life with somebody else and about a want to share my life with a mutually loving and a right person which I know would enhance my life and I would enhance it why did I always since I was very young wanted it so badly and never found everything else again that I am going to do by myself seems like a second best situation I also understand about changing my attitude but can you enlighten me regarding why I am going through this experience why did my heart set to this experience so first of all if you understood about changing your attitude why are you still expressing the old attitude because I feel lonely without some other person to share my life well you have friends and you are attracting new individuals all the time so are you not willing to accept how the universe is delivering it for perhaps you can say one person need not be all things to one person and as you accept that from the universe in lieu of the fact that perhaps you have feel in the path to shift from the universe with the mother by allowing the form that it does take now and understand that the universe is delivering it to you perhaps not as you expect at first and interacting with what the universe does deliver you then become open and receptive for that particular manifestation but again when you say it the way you are saying it you are not necessarily locking it in vibratorily by maintaining it as a clear intention and that again was one of the reasons for your presence in that interaction last evening in this particular location for the idea is if it is not immediately available you have the choice to say well it's not here right now either I intend for it to occur or well since it's not here right now I can assume this is evidence that it's not going to happen and one sets up a vibratory distinction from the other so do you intend for this to happen knowing that you deserve it and desire it yes or no? I would like it to happen but I'm on that point of giving up you are a creator and if you give up you will get back I am asking you what it is you want do you intend to happen? that gives me tools to add that is like can I ask that and again I ask that and this is the point you nearly or nearly need desire something realizing that the obtaining it is within your integrity will not harm you will not harm anyone else will perhaps create something that you designed gives you the entire right to design with it and in desiring something and realizing that you deserve it you then only need in that then state it as an intention I intend to do so very loosely I have no idea how it will play out I have no idea how long it will take but I will not stop intending for that to happen for that is who I am now how does that feel? okay to say it rightly I don't even have to go through all that it's already there that intention is already there but when you say I am willing to accept that it has not occurred up till now as evidence that it will not occur that in that moment it is not a clear intention anymore it is a surrender intent the mere fact that it is still there in spite of everything that happened is a proof that I am well proof that you desire it now if you feel that you deserve it and you have a definition of what it is all that is left is clear intention and where applicable clear action that is it if the other three things are in place the desire the definition of what it is the desirability of the three things then clear intention locks in the vibration and clear action from what is available in a given moment moves you or steers you directly toward the vibration of that intention but if you set your course in a sense toward that vibration and along the way understanding that saying well I will accept that it hasn't happened as evidence that it won't you and that sense are no longer on a straight course you veer off to the left or right and it takes in that much longer to actually get there unless you are willing to once again re-establish course the clear intention does this make sense a creator simply can invoke or intend for something to happen and once again if it is within integrity why not what would even be a reason you don't deserve it if it is within integrity and what you are requesting is within your integrity a lot of that to sink in and proceed yeah almost I'm not sure if I just want to mention and then go on to the next but my mother had this habit of denying even the thing because she had to say that I should get used to this appointment and I feel like it is that that is a gift that she is offering you which you can choose to accept and have it then be your particular expression or you may understand that you do not have to accept every gift that is offered if you look at it that way you can simply use that as an incomplete alignment of what you do not prefer and therefore do not intend to set up this appointment you are the creator you do the appointing therefore only you can this appointment by allowing your trust to stray or again doubt is not a lack of trust it is a complete trust in the thing you don't prefer so it is not a matter of getting good at trusting simply seeing where you are trusting deciding if that's where you wish to be trusting and shifting your trust and intention to where you prefer simply because you deserve it because you say so yeah okay so now I am going to explore getting to on my past and future life I am aware of some of my past life is there any other information that I can receive from you that I need to know I can't? is there something that stands out that you wish some clarification about? I guess basically about relationships with people who have strongly affected me and who came out of nowhere this is just a curiosity question actually that did we have something to do with accounts to settle or they just were doing me favor I like to think in that way that even if they were harsh to me I think in a way they were they did me some favor but not necessarily I know I don't know not necessarily I know what the favor was but I am sure they were trying to help me because they didn't have a strong affect on me but perhaps if you wish you can rather than considering it in that way consider it as a dance and individuals getting perhaps caught up in the music many times will automatically perform certain function but once you are willing to become conscious rather than automatic the whole effect will change but yes you can perhaps say loosely that there are certain connections that have resulted in certain things that have allowed for certain things but that allows you to learn to decide what you wish to do from this point forward and that is the main point anything that you would glean from a past life a power of life an altered life a probable life is only as useful as you can apply it right now so if there's some issue that comes up now that you feel a connection with from somewhere else not really at one point I used to be very anxious to find out and then I lost interest and I have no interest in finding out are you taught that you lived thousands of lives? well the point is that it is that many and why they do not all stand out is only the ones relevant to what you are exploring now have any reason to come to the forefront so as you begin to consciously dive into your exploration yes from time to time there will be enhancements bleed throughs if you will of some of the other lives whereby you had similar explorations but many are perhaps most of them are simply irrelevant for they were lives chosen in limitation and now you are beginning to explore limit lessness so there are less lives in that sense that apply to this life some of the ones which strongly do would be in what you consider and perhaps some individuals do not even believe in this idea about what you call active lenses for there were many of the individuals that are present in these interactions that were strongly associated and related in that timing in the timing you call Egyptian communities in the timing you call ancient Mayan communities in certain as you say Native American Indian cultures as well as the culture that you are presently within there are a plethora of ties and connections what can you tell me about my future life from here to the point in time where you are am I going to incarnate on earth or anywhere else? there is a degree of likelihood that you will choose for you are now in a very unique life perhaps you can say many of the lives prior to this were again steep in limitation this is the life where both exist you have perhaps at linearly speaking the beginning of the life limitation and separation then perhaps again loosely speaking in the middle of the life beginning to entertain the ideas of integration and at the end of the life the actual experience or perhaps you can say from this point forward the actual experience of the limitlessness all in one life span but very often after such a transformation individuals will choose to reincarnate to perhaps you can say share the spoils of the victory of your consciousness in other words when you transform to the more limitless society you will wish to then be within it and enjoy what you have created so there was the possibility in that sense and strong likelihood of perhaps one to several more lives in this particular realm or playing but understand it is completely up to you and this is also not always taught in your religion but what you believe to be most true for you is what you will experience at the time of death so therefore knowing this you can begin to look at what you believe and decide if what you believe is what you prefer if what you truly prefer is to die in a very conscious way knowing that you have transformed and being shall we say existing in the transformed state with complete choice in front of you then that will be your option do you see me on e-prophyny in any comments about that life or if I'm going to be there then who I will be doing understand in general we will not reveal this if you have not made a decision however I will make an exception you are strongly connected to our society and there is in all likelihood the idea of life or lives to be led here I never even had thought about all this but I hear other people talking about meeting their future self on research and you know well once you make the determination that you wish to then you will increase your accessibility to your future self understanding again that you have an infinite number of future selves and that will merely represent for the you three seconds from now is a future self as well I'm really interested in knowing if Basha and yourself lived on earth around this time and it's so what are you doing now and who are you where are you and then of course how is it possible to be at two places physically or am I missing? well you are simultaneous being expressing an infinite multitude of expressions one of the ideas of this human expression is to have the seeming shall we say amnesia or lack of knowledge about the rest but when you begin to extend you can become more aware of the simultaneity of things there are what would loosely correspond to the life led on this planet by Basha is the individual known as Darryl Anka the individual channel and my and lans shall we say one life led upon your planet is in azure form so if there is me living on earth now maybe she or he would contact me if you would in that sense desire and take the steps to initiate but understand nothing is being breached from the overall again perspective of the over soul not through the physical self all these things exist simultaneously from my point of view I am who I am and Andrew is a factor from Andrew's point of view he is who he is and I am a future self so at the same time that we are one being there is due to this particular shall we say complexity of your reality a seeming separation at the same time I know that seems confusing perhaps we can answer more questions than I was in a way it's not confusing I call I like to call myself 1948 that's when I was born so in that sense suppose I am doing born in I don't know but suppose 55 so he would be 1965 he would be 24 something that makes sense to me the same idea of being on a string and maybe fifth beat so allow us for this analogy picture a ladder or many ladders side by side and the wrongs on the ladder represent the lives and sometimes a wrong will in that sense extend from one ladder to another thereby creating a common alley I would perceive that my one earth life was Andrew in a sense I am this ladder over here Andrew is this ladder over here and there is one wrong between us however what he proceeds to be his path earth lives are not my earth life this is the only common life that we have so once again the string of beads also has other parallel strings of the and other strings from time to time going across that creates certain relationships that exist across the beads but not down the beads again this may be confusing in translation I never thought of this I think I am going to say I will have a job in having this conversation okay now this is about evolution I feel like I should just maybe say how I used to feel and that will make sense I hope it will interest you just as a process for what happens I used to think I thought a soul goes upwards or beyond so to speak it's further evolved it is each reincarnation of the analogy I was starting with kinder than it then goes to grade school and college and so on some people around me I thought had even few PhDs they seem to be so advanced and some still in grade school I also thought that it was possible to skip grades and advance faster absolute and that at one point one became nothing didn't exist anymore or stop being this was well not real this was there is perhaps where the theory breaks down that used to be my understanding I always always felt very strongly that this was very selfish of any soul being interested in just once own liberation was not a very nice thing to do I thought I used to think and then I understood about spirit guides I thought I thought I thought all three guys are liberated souls in a sense generally they will assume a point of focus which will seem more limited than the overall over soul and seem more akin to your own human style of consciousness but this can value and the most recent addition to this knowledge and only since I saw your tape on TV last September couple of months back and it was interesting to know about the seven dimensions and I still haven't heard all the tapes but I will actually had read the mention of seven levels or seven worlds in a book but I am sure there's some description or information regarding these books in India and I will surprise about such advanced life size exist on other planets I knew that they were life on other planets but the idea of their being in fourth and fifth dimension that is really interesting well sixth and seventh as well and that only comprises your one octave beyond which things become so uncran later will add to make those sense but understand when the notion that the universe which by the way is a multi-verse is infinite this is one concept that generally gets watered down and it's a very important concept that is one concept that generally gets watered down for your languages where you are finite beings exploring finity and infinity doesn't have a beginning doesn't have a middle has no reference point have no time has no limitation of the amount of dimensions that it can express that question going back to the way it happens instead of just going further do so travel backwards also well they can do they will choose to be animals again well not really or you have not in that sense truly in the way that you are perhaps supposing work up through the animal kingdom but perhaps when your consciousness infused into a humanity form style of body in that sense so to speak encoded within that body is the sum total of the knowledge and experience of the other species now I do not again know how this transverse but it is more accurate than to believe that your own individual sentient soul as you know it has evolved quote unquote up from the bottom that is the most important thing to do with that is not quote up from the bottom that is not mechanically precise also evolution of gender decline does it happen on its own without anybody engineering it things to make it up and again do other things shall we say strongly are inclined to believe that genetics in that sense cause the consciousness and our complete understanding is that your genetics or any aspect of your physicality is a reflection of your consciousness so yes the tendency of things affecting your genetics but what ultimately affects it is whatever corresponding shift or interpretation within your consciousness then corresponds to that change and a change in your mentality in your consciousness's point of view does shift the literal genetics down to the set of down to the atom the superstring as you say are you in that sense more comfortable with how this interaction is transpiring enough feeling that you are being rushed? seems to me that bodies are like machines any kind of machine can you can be imagined and then designed and then particular souls go and give that machine a life is that so well in a sense again you are still coming from the perspective that you are within the body or in having it and the body is within the consciousness so on some level it may appear to be machine life but it is an expression of consciousness itself which so does deep sets it apart from the technical description of a machine your body is within your consciousness as an expression of not that your soul is within your body now that is an transparency and I understand where the notion arises from but it is not technically accurate I just think of old people and I forgot the main teacher they got together and the people on isha-sanis are children of I'm not good with the names I don't know how to teach you are speaking of the reticulum society what is it you wish to know so the bodies are the order of these two are these and the soul can come from anywhere once a style of body exists then it is an option for consciousness to partake so once a particular reality is created it will attract many different soul expressions for many different styles of reality who simply say well look I can try this I will do it now and since they are already in four dimensions of the source would have to be that much advance to be able to live there well the idea is that when you begin to express that aspect of yourself you transform the reality around you it is not literally that there are entrance requirements you change you transform the reality as you begin being a third transitional fourth density expression to embody and to act from fourth density perspectives you create fourth density effects in your mind and this is what then transforms it when there is enough of them occurring that momentum literally will seem to replace the third density moment and it is a gradual smooth transition always will you also feel at the same being seemingly that the reality around you is changing that is one of the aspects perhaps you can say of soul you always know who you are individuals will perhaps imagine that again the end product of the expansion of consciousness is emerging into perhaps you can say some type of void but this is not literally true and in that sense never would you merge with all that is which is anything but a void by the way until you decide to and even when deciding to you can then change your mind now I know again that this perhaps may not translate very adequately but perhaps allows you to see how much more leeway you have within the mechanism that is taught individuals will explore this type of reality simply because it exists and it is a style of being this not to necessarily accomplish anything but to simply be that way explore it try it on because it's there it's been okay to have my success but who would want to come as a child you know I believe in family and be abused that seems to me well there are very many reasons for this and again you are invalidating that exploration and assuming that it does not have the right and reason to exist now that may not be your reasoning but those individuals are expressing that many times not knowing they have an alternative but then finally coming to terms with that growing through that and then expressing the power making the transformation and truly appreciating what had happened to them from a different perspective not from the perspective of victim but from the perspective of create or having created and explored victimhood and then chosen something else there is a great joy in this now I understand while you are exploring the victimhood it is not that evident you want to ask you about the bluetooth I think right here and you talked about months back to mention about the seven days you can do everything to it because of realm and Krishna both incarnations have supposed to have had blue skin or a compilation this in a sense was one of the reasons for the assignment of the godlike quality students they would in a sense represent what we are speaking of and that's something interesting because when you say they are raised then how come not everybody was broken only they were here? well understand first of all that the areas that you are speaking of were not the areas that they existed strongly within and that those were individuals what you call Lemoria which would loosely correspond to the area of your Hawaiian island and Pacific islands did in that sense house a particular perhaps you can say island or continent which they existed on mass upon basically when that particular expression ended so did the race but there were shall we say individuals still around in a sense have a look good question imagine if only were I can think of but maybe they were switched or something with us who knows how big big god into the womb of mother who was like everybody else whatever maybe because they were god they could do it I can't think of any other explanation only with Krishna there is this story that it was I'm sure it was possible that he was switched the babies were switched but I don't know how it could have happened but they were not bored in the way that you have been left to do it I want to switch completely so different topic and I would bring to ask you what my daughters do daughters can you say anything about our past and futures I mean life what is the focus of your connection in this line? my older one is not interested at all in all this and the younger one is waking to know more about it and she knows spiritual and well in a sense reincarnation you may understand that they had played similar roles perhaps you can say to some degree and I mean this in the slang and devil's advocate versus someone who would advocate your point of view and in that sense allowing them for an open exchange and the validation of ideas that you do not necessarily agree with which will then have the overall effect of allowing the daughter who does not in that sense buy into it to still validate what you are doing I was just wondering if you know of anything that my younger daughter is going to be involved in or is she going to? I don't know I'm just again curious if that type of question which I will have asked I think and I already know that you don't say anything that I don't need to know once we will stand there is a strong propensity for what you would call music in this individual is it yet evident? she learns and is to make very quick labor she didn't have the opportunity to do the lesson so it's not happening now she's just doing 17 and she had a very good voice for me now well we do perceive some involvement of that but perhaps the overall idea is expression for she desires to express us now we are talking about choosing an experience she has a serious case of a prevention and a way that's all before you proceed therefore having a desire to express us now can you see some way in which she feels she is prevented or that she is actually prevented from expressing no she's I was spoken I don't know why we suggest in that sense that you explore this where she is squelched either from herself from others that perhaps you are not aware of or perhaps in some way from yourself but when she is allowed to express something which has been shall we say denied and suppressed then there will not be the shall we say outer symbol of the bursting force onto the physical body from within she was born with it and I lived through it with her and I am crying I kind of separated myself now she's going to her therapist social worker because she likes to talk to somebody she can we all know that it's the reason behind it is I'm glad you're stressed and well we get to introduce to her what you are word in terms of intention in terms of excitement in terms of integrity for when she in that sense is allowed to identify what truly moves her it will give her again somewhere to aim whatever applies to you and share it across the board and we both the both girls and then they will take whatever they need to do and the more that you are willing to not insist the stronger will be the possibility that they will exist can you tell me in your specifics about my near future purpose in this life or long term now that is not our department I know I mean I knew that you say that but I was wondering if you could kind of give me any direction because as I tell I think there is a strong degree of likelihood that you will continue to unfold and perhaps apply much of the information that you attract from the many sources that you attracted as you begin to display within your life success in utilizing principles of self empowerment you will then thereby take tenfold one hundredfold increase your ability to express and share that with many individuals which is our strongest perception of one of your stronger desires therefore that is available and the strongest way to do so is to simply begin with yourself and on whatever level is available then expand out as I was saying I knew that you wouldn't have been retired so I wouldn't have asked the question except I've been always asked by the way I had to ask something because I've been feeling so lost and so empty and so deep person all that and that's not me and well have you not in a sense established a new direction a new desire of something you wish to do and that is the exciting I don't feel tired or anything when I do that so I know I want to do that I don't want to take it to as many people as I can and I always thought about all that but that's on one level that's one part of it and the other part that's still way shy and all that maybe this will take over this part would take over the other part and I would forget about the sadness or I would bet on vice versa well that is what happens as you begin to realize that these are not parts playing of a war with you they are choices within you and when you choose to believe the negative choice you get those feelings when you choose to believe the positive choice you get those feelings and you are more now inclined in perhaps knowing that it is a possibility to choose the positive which then makes the negative choice within you less and less relevant and therefore seeming to have less and less effect does that make sense and at the same time if there are other things that I really wish are going to happen they would still happen if you maintain it as a clear intention and act upon what is right there everything that you have as a clear intention will always occur this is the degree of power that you have so perhaps you may wish to begin looking at why you may be hesitant to even state certain thing as an intention which perhaps again to something which may tie back to that you feel that you or one does not deserve such a thing which you do again the same thing two parts one part doesn't even feel its noise that once again do not say parts you kind of you wish but if you wish to transform the safe choices within you for you know they are choices you know you believe them both it would be an accurate to say you believe one or the other so once you put them in perspective of them being choices that word choices rather than part which again sets up a paralysis in the middle of the parts choices always keys you back into that you are the choosin and then you can look at all right obviously I believe both things and obviously I am choosing to express the negative belief do I wish to do that no what would I be doing if I were expressing the positive and this is where the repurrential you comes in and it is funny I mean most of the things I kind of I knew myself but still knowing it is one thing but applying it is quite different well knowing it is one thing from my perspective applying it is simpler than knowing and that is my definition therefore I offer it to you as well you talked about different people are bringing happen as one person I always thought of this idea of a quilt a factual and whatever and is not one person is going to bring it to me but many people are going to contribute towards the whole big place but that does not mean that when you begin to accept this from all directions that you will not create an expression of one individual who will seem to meet most of them but the idea is to allow what is created in your life to meet these needs so that you can display to the universe that I mean I really desire this and look when I get it I use it as an example I don't think of any other things except if I'm trying to get in touch with my again I started to ask you this before and I know what you said about me not being separated for herself and all that but this is how it happened I went to a psychic prayer and went to a class or a workshop and just laid it all about pendulum using pendulum to get in touch with your higher self and I did that and I did get in touch with I don't know what you created something that you trusted and therefore got the effect of being your higher self in the guys of having gotten in touch with it if it possible that these are either are or age I don't know the number but entities from either the planets or they just must be carried so is it part of me my conscious that are speaking to me communicating with me you are having internal conversations but there is perhaps you can say another separate from yourself also speaking to that would correspond to your extra terrestrial connection that we have to some degree discuss and all one to take it a step further is very strongly connected to my society for now that it is far as I can go with that now understand one other thing have you ever looked in what you call a periscope that is a device which one will look into which then as a long to with a mirror and an eye out the top so to speak so that you can look over something have you seen what you call submarina do you understand that if you wish to have an exercise so to speak pretend as you say that you are looking in a periscope that rather than facing up goes down through the floor and is facing down and out picture your perspective as you turn your head of looking through this then open your eyes look around as though what you are seeing from your eyes is an extension of that reflection from down and do you understand in other words as though you are looking from one perspective into a periscope going down and seeing out your physical eyes so that makes sense not others but I am that will give you some sense of the connection of your higher sense so it is possible for my I don't know what I would use what word I would lower cells of my past life is it possible to connect with them that they would come in communitivity and tell me try to teach them it is possible if it would serve your purpose without taking away your power though in general that will simply come as a flash of something else you have done similar to what you are doing that will generally be the form of it you can consciously reach back to your past cells as the future self that you are now and perhaps at times where things they have seen a little rough urge them on nudge them on pat them on the back and say you will turn out all right see look at me that is possible without my asking would they contact me and communicate me and try to if it was necessary but in general again that would generally be a distraction and many of them are not as aware in the sense that you are speaking to me of and are in that sense involved physically in their minds so it would not occur to them to stop what they are doing and speak to a future self so to speak so I guess then that was a long theory and trying to make well you are exploring things with in you and perhaps clothing as past life tell me for some reason and I'm kind of having a conflict I have decided to let it go at that and just have trust but still when you say I have decided to have trust and then say but still you are contradicting because I had a big struggle and I had to deal with that struggle does your trust have a time limit or is trust something with no limit and if it does have a time limit when that time limit is over can you really say it was trust or conditions it's not time limit but it's really affecting me well if you understood beyond the shadow of a doubt that when you need to know you will know would that satisfy you? if you really believed it could you then be patient and allow it to unfold? yeah I think that means no offense well all I can do in that sense is reflect but that is the case therefore you have the choice now to understand everything will become apparent trust the timing in which it does if it is not happening that is your strong feedback that that is not the point right now that's something else is and the more you are willing to dive into what is the point the closer you paradoxically come to making sense out of these things so ground yourself to the moment if it's available fine use it do it if not trust and do what you can do the doing of what you can do shows demonstrates that trust rather than rather than wallowing the other side of that one is if I do that if I just let them have the control of when they want to tell me then it's like it's opposite of self-improvement well let me ask you this this is how I function through the channel only allowing certain information out at certain time there is a vast degree of information you never hear it is perhaps likely that you will but it is simply not the timing and would not serve you or the channel or any of you were I to in that sense share this before there was a foundation to appreciate it so am I disempowering the channel by doing so or am I being mindful and compassionate of his requirements so to speak and time it is the same thing it is the world not I with holding but a time yes that's as far as I'm going to take it at this time or you should because I am willing to go as far as you wish the good side of it I did learn a lot of good things and I did and I thought I understand so much about communicating without any language that was to be something but you have chosen to be physical in a world where the prime method of communication is language so also in addition to the appreciation of that remain grounded to the use of language as expression as well which is one again of the reason that we in this interaction are for now imposing that it be done in language or that is the main form of communication on your planet which will appeal and assist most people right now yes I do believe my language to be really good and full of vocabulary and all that because I plan to write and that's how I want to communicate to other people so I understand the importance of language also but at the same time I'm going to say my friends whatever they are they actually train me in using the thought process not what shall I call it in your language but not in lieu of but in addition to and I know that they the purpose to all this but except that I'm not being told what's happening well you are expanding your perspective aware you are expanding your ability to receive and deliver communication within your reality and also extra dimensionally as well you are getting your feet being acclimated in that sense and what you are there not thing to me I should just drop it and not be angry about it or not ask too many questions well they will not in that sense tell you you should do anything very similar as to the approach you get from you very similar they love you they trust even when your trust is in the things you don't prefer they still trust that you will explore expand and work through it so the trust is on both of us and we do have a lot of fun and the sense of humor and all that that is all that is very nice and I enjoy that part and I have this company that brings both sides of joy that is a commonality of experience in a joyful way we also in that sense maintain a degree of humor for that is how we act that is how we think and express ourselves I want to talk about this during the general interaction because it's kind of personal and I've thought a lot about it and I guess I decided to talk to you about this but I feel like it's a private thing between him or them and me but for some reason I thought you would understand so I'm trying to explore with you what is always in your life well you are getting acquainted and while that is occurring perhaps it will be quite private and individual if there is a reason for it to expand it will simply become obvious and feel right so allow the feedback of what is going on to be incorporated into your trust whatever it is at any given moment is perfect and you need not project what it will be or what it was just enjoy it for what it is and it will continually transform for change is one of the only constant costumes anything else you want to tell me? quite a bit has been said and we do refer to you to again at whatever timing and whatever rate is comfortable for you to listen back upon the recording that you have made or understand that much is involved within these interactions and you can literally listen to them and then listen to them down the line when you have affected changes shift your point of view and here perhaps almost an completely different interaction such is the degree of layering in the information and it will stand out in relief as each point becomes more relevant to what you are exploring in any given moment quite a bit has been there and orchestration of information is there anything else you wish to share? oh yes it is part of something the poetry I write is it possible that something else or somebody else sometimes writes to me? it is something that will be possible up till now you may take full credit they are about three or four or whatever number you are feeling the lines opening up so to speak to that possibility it will find its own signature when it is discreetly and distinctly something else and I am not talking about automatic writing I am through my head I mean through my mind if I am a tool in other words I tell anybody I am just a tool for a translation perhaps not it is all poetic but some of it and I know that because I did not understand what it meant and it took me a long time to understand that again maybe perhaps musings from your higher self that will again become more apparent as you begin to expand and express yourself in that way okay in short I feel like a clear of a pond of clear water with nothing empty and maybe that is a good idea to be completely empty because now I can be filled with whatever well as you create the board you will always have it again filled according to the vibration that you now are so as you shift that vibration perhaps you may wish to drain the pond sometimes and then allow it to refill but also understand that your impact is far and the dropping of a stone or pebble into the center of that pond does create ripples that literally shall we say begin to encompass the entire pond every difference is a difference oh no need to work is having a good time I will however once again ask do you feel more comfortable now in knowing that my communications with you are meant in nothing but a completely attentive and unconditionally loving way or is there still some of the sense in that sense of being as you have said rushed I think what happened was I had this bad habit of comparing and I felt like some people had a better time with your you spend more time with them and I am a quiet person I don't push and maybe that came into the room well perhaps you have hit as you say the nail on the head for the individuals that would perhaps seem that we will go more into you will find are willing to continue the interaction and never do we cut you off or perhaps you stop so you need not be so quiet if there is something you have to share remember we will only always interpret it as a gift and nothing else and we also wish being that we do not speak your language and there is a degree again of translation going on that you are fully clarified with what we are saying only can you tell us in that sense if something requires clarification thereby allowing us the opportunity to expect and only can you say well that isn't what I was asking or settle for the answer that you got if you feel that it did not address what you were asking so as willing as you are to participate you will find us then reflecting back and perhaps the definition of our interactions will begin to expand according to that all right okay one last question that's it just like the channels that I have this complex about my language and I speak a different my mother tongue is different and I speak my language and my language and my way from our interaction with you in this particular shall we say space of time we must say that you have an excellent command of the English language I write better than I speak because I have time to think when I write anyway my question was because of language that's one reason but instead of channeling like I do that is it and because I have been getting training or whatever about this self- I think that in the future is that there or you can always utilize any of the things that you love to use as an expression and channel for all channeling is is in effect doing that thing with no hesitation no doubt as a full commitment to who you are so you can express it in your art you can express it in your music you can express it in your poetry there is simply no limitation in terms of allowing your imagination to come up with many ways to express it but I'm talking about specific channeling that is what we mean like I do that but instead of being a channel like him is it possible that I will be channeling absolutely in a sense you may understand you get to choose so begin now we touch in with what truly excites you in terms of how you wish to express it as a laying down of that as a clear intention clarifies the agreement and allows them from their end to then be more specific for you are being more specific in how you wish to express it so I'm waiting for what happened but I have well decide have an intention and then perhaps allow it to happen and trust the time if I if I really want to do that I think that's an indication that it's supposed to happen it's a desire the excitement is not yet what we think it has been our joy I assume this to be the first of perhaps more interactions of this format with you and also in that sense understand that you can access our stream directly by simply in a meditative state allowing yourself to conjure up in your heart how it feels when you interact with then you will dial our phone number so to speak you will perhaps you can say ring up our vibration and you can get direct communication in this way to the degree that you are willing to trust and validate what you get understanding our style all right then I thank you and visually most fun and mother has you true
