 Welcome and greetings this evening of your time as you create time to exist. How are you all? Oh, thank you. Perfect as well. Allow me, as we have discussed, to entitle this interaction, definition and deserved ability. I will begin by reminding you that we have laid down the format that this particular interaction will comprise, perhaps you can say, part two of a three-part intensive. Part one, last month of your time, was clarifying your vision. This particular interaction, again, will be on definition and deserved ability, which we will discuss. And next month of your time, action, understand what we are doing in creating the intensive in three parts as it is covering the basics, shall I say, and perhaps you can say a slightly more advanced passion of creating your own reality consciously, conscious, creativity. Last month of your time, we discussed your vision or your clear intention as we have already to some degree covered, your intention locks in your reality, allows you to have say, allows you to decide, using whatever criteria that you will, what will occur in your reality. The criteria of preference allows your vision to be aligned to your passion, to your excitement, to some degree we have discussed this, and led an exercise to allow you to get in touch with what it is that truly excites you. Therefore we will now expand upon this idea, explain certain aspects that now that you have crystallized, now that you have created your vision, you can now utilize what you already have created in your reality to a positive advantage. And through this approach, transform whatever it is that you do not prefer presently about your reality to a preferred manifestation. So first of all, we will then discuss with you the idea of definitions for your definitions literally are how you define your reality. And perhaps you can say another way of saying what you believe about your reality. The definitions that you assign to your reality are part and parcel of the beliefs about that reality. So therefore allow us to start in the following way. Then you have clarified, established and clarified your vision. There will be certain definitions that you may still hold which may run contrary to the fulfillment in a positive way of that vision. Therefore this will now be the timing upon the establishment of your clear intention, your clear vision for many of these definitions to come up. You will see as they come up, if you allow them to deliver to you the message that they have that you can very quickly transform any definitions that you hold about your vision which again run contrary to the manifestation of that vision in your life as your reality. So therefore there are perhaps particular definitions that you have bought into and if they are contrary to your clear vision, they will come up. Step one is allow them to come up. We have discussed allowance. Allowance is the mechanism of true creatorhood. It is the way that you already create your reality through allowance. So therefore allowing the definitions to come up as they will, again perhaps the ones that run contrary to the fulfillment of your vision and allowing yourself to acknowledge that you hold those definitions is always the first step to redefining those definitions. I remind you when you believe something you then feel that way. You then think that way. You then act that way and it is ultimately those actions which then create physically into your life the manifestation that you prefer. When you establish your vision in whatever way you find is easiest for you whether it be mentally through dialogue, mentally through meditation on your paper and pencil, whatever way you find that you organize your thinking at this point, utilize it in the following way. Once you have established your clear vision, your clear intention, make note of what definitions a person who is already doing that thing would have. As you begin to do this you begin to allow yourself to see the definitions necessary to begin to manifest your clear vision in the path of least resistance. Often as you do so again in whatever way your organizational skills allow. You will also through the process of elimination find which definitions perhaps you can say you would need have to establish your clear vision in reality and then also that will be an opportunity to allow whatever definitions that you have that run contrary to that vision to come up. You can find yourself to define the vision locks in the vision allowing yourself to understand what definitions a person already accomplished in that vision would have allows you to define still further how it is in your consciousness that you can reorient yourself toward in that sense your vision is this clear so far. Or again in whatever way you find most efficient whether you write it whether it is merely a dialogue whether it is through your meditative state establish make the time to establish what definitions one would need hold that is already doing the thing you say you wish to do. And allowing any definitions that you already express that run contrary to that particular definition to come out acknowledge it allow yourself to see as you acknowledge it that it has had you feeling a certain way has had you thinking a certain way and ultimately has had you acting a certain way those actions are the actions in your life that still run contrary to what you say you prefer. When you establish the new definition that the preferred you perhaps you could say would have you can also extrapolate in your imagination how would a person already believing this feel and feel that allow yourself to physically feel it before then moving on to the step of establishing how a person who already believes that would think once you allow yourself to feel that belief the thoughts of a person with that belief will come quite clearly quite quickly and then allow yourself to see the actions that that you would in that sense perform now perhaps it will be obvious to some of you that to some degree we have already discussed a tool a methodology through which much of what we are discussing is simply automatic that is what you call the referential preferential you for in the creation of the you in your imagination and handing situations over to that you that you have the definitions that you would prefer the definitions that reinforce the clear vision. So going about it through the referential preferential you is one very powerful very accessible way to get in touch with your definition and to transform them to definitions that you already prefer. But again even the listing of the definitions the willingness to define clearly for yourself the definitions that your vision would necessitate simply speed along the process you can go at it from either way you can do both the referential preferential you again is a tool that is part and parcel of you you can never lose that tool and therefore that tool will always provide the definition that are most conducive to do anything that you wish. If your reality appears to run contrary to your clear vision I again remind you that a person who believes in their clear vision would contain the definition that you call persistence. Persistence is simply a matter of understanding that you are going you intend to create this reality and simply nothing in the external world can stop that intention perhaps it may not go according to the timing perhaps it will but if it does not your unwillingness to give up on the idea means you can never fail. So if your reality appears contrary to what it is that you say you desire maintain that clear vision and drum up or allow to come to the surface any definitions that would suggest otherwise for your definitions will either reinforce your clear vision or they may seem at times to be at odds with it if those definitions are not the most conducive definitions for that vision again your life will let you know. If you always remember that you can trace back to your definitions through how you feel through how you think and through how you act your life will always be your barometer either you can as you say catch it as an emotion that perhaps you do not prefer but if you find yourself still to some degree seemingly automatically performing non-preferred actions which we will discuss in more detail understand that those actions in and of themselves also can be used to trace back to the most expressed definition in that moment you truly act as though you are the person who believes whatever it is you believe so you can use your emotions your thoughts and your actions to define what you must be believing in that moment. Now allow me to draw a distinction which again we will expand on in a future interaction when you say I believe this and I do not believe perhaps it's opposite understand you contain both beliefs otherwise you would not be able to draw the distinction any belief that you do not prefer and do not wish to express your ability to even think of it means you contain it so it is not a matter of getting rid of this belief and having that belief you have all belief it is a matter of which belief are you expressing in your life everything that you believe and everything that you do not say you believe still exists within you I remind you there is no outside therefore you contain all belief the ones that are having an effect on your life in any given moment are the beliefs that you are expressing from all of the beliefs that exist within you so if you say well I must believe this I remind you you also contain the opposite belief and therefore it is nearly a matter of which belief do you express and I again remind you that you express your beliefs through your emotions thoughts and actions remembering this truly gives you back your power for you understand that you contain all definition it is not a matter of needing to get rid of the ones you do not prefer simply choosing and expressing the ones that you do not while not invalidating the beliefs you do not prefer expressing the beliefs you do prefer and not invalidating the beliefs that you do not whenever you create anything in your life you are expressing a belief but you also contain that opposite belief in every given moment I tell you this to simply allow you to see the degree to which you do have complete power to which you do contain it all and it is simply a matter of which beliefs you express as to which ones will have a result or an effect in your life so allow yourself to come to terms with what definitions would be who of your vision and allow your life to deliver any definition which is not in alignment with that vision and embrace embrace yourself for delivering the non preferred definition do not be right or judge yourself you are handing yourself back your power not showing yourself your shortcoming unless you label it that way therefore you can get either effect but if you understand that your reality is handing you back the keys to drive perhaps you can say the vehicle of your life in a preferred direction you may rejoice when something negative comes up not because you embrace the negative aspects of it not because you condone it but because only now is it back in your power to redefine any definition that you are achieving a result from is simply the definition you are expressing but I remind you again that you contain all definition now that you know this it is up to you to exercise your ability to respond your responsibility with the preferred definition or not and should an unpreferred definition come up embrace it and allow yourself to utilize its timing of presenting itself to you to be your perfect timing to replace it and express the new preferred definition or belief therefore again your reality on a silver platter will hand you any definition that is no longer representative of who you choose to be if you run in silk it will simply seem to be in that sense obstacles in your path if you embrace it allow yourself to feel it glean the definition choose a new definition allow yourself to feel that allow yourself to see how you would think with the new definition allow yourself to see how you would act with the new definition and act as a person with the new definition would act you are transforming your reality through exactly the same mechanism that you already for your entire life have created it therefore there are no new skills to bone up on simply the willingness to once again allow your reality to transform by presenting to you these various definitions which no longer serve you therefore that for the most part will cover the idea of definition allow us now to discuss another ability that you all have and that is one of the reasons that even in your language this is called deserve ability this is not something that you need to go get this is again a definition within you that I in that sense challenge you to express you have the ability to understand that you deserve to create the reality that you prefer particularly if that reality is with an integrity for then it will harm no one else will harm not you and everyone in that sense is served you exist this is one of your primary quality merely that you exist that brings along with it the automatic ability to know that you must obviously deserve to exist otherwise how did you get here did you slip in a crack of creation no you expressed the definition of the fact that you deserve to exist by taking the action of incarnating as this life and because you are an expression of all that is all that is which is not truly separate from you but you sometimes view it this way always bequeath that you deserve to exist the only one who ever in that sense entertain the reciprocal definition is each and every one of you for again because you contain all beliefs it is not accurate to say I only contain the belief that I do not deserve anything and it is not accurate to say I only contain the belief that I do deserve everything you contain both the least therefore you have the choice of which one to express and you can allow your reality through the feedback of your actions thoughts and emotions to allow you to know in any given moment if you are expressing that you deserve or if you are expressing that you do not deserve either way you are expressing one or the other there is no outside that judges you because all that is is 100% non-failingly unconditionally loving you simply cannot screw up in the eyes of all that is everything goes that is what unconditional love me therefore the only one who can assign that you do not deserve anything is you now you may perhaps say well others seem to very willingly in my society to find that I do not deserve this or that but understand when someone says that to you if you do not believe it simply is an empty statement with no effect if you feel an effect from it that is not them influencing you that is them providing a reflection that somewhere within you you still match that vibration you can only feel your matching of the vibration and in that moment you still contain the belief that you deserve it all you are simply expressing the belief that you do not do you understand the distinction therefore deserve ability your ability to deserve is simply a given and you can express or revoke that particular designation no one else nothing else can and again if you are expressing I deserve to exist I deserve to create a life of ecstasy with integrity then anything that anyone says to you will simply be thank you but no thank you I appreciate what you are saying I will take it under advisement if I feel in that sense that changes need be made I thank you if not I still thank you you have reflected to me flawlessly and not patronizingly but if you sincerely are willing to thank the messenger it is perhaps you can say a most integrated alternative to shooting the message and I mean this in any way that it will come any definition that is delivered to you in your life you can blame the definition shoot the messenger or you can understand that the messenger has served a purpose embrace the messenger perhaps catch the messenger off guard but that is all right that is what you will begin to express as you choose integration when you begin to express integration you will not only understand that your ability to deserve is up to you to express but you will also begin to see the deserve ability in others perhaps others that you had here to for judged for they to have the right and reason all that is obviously think so all that is loves them unconditionally now you can begin to exercise that same unconditionality now you can begin to once again recognize the divinity perhaps you can say it is an expression I will therefore use it in each individual and with that divinity comes unconditional love comes deserve ability and comes a set of express definition you can always use anything that is offered to you in any form in a positive way now many times you assume that perhaps there are a few things in your reality which simply have no way to assign a positive label to understand everything everything is synchronous and if you say you are willing to assign a positive meaning sometimes your reality will see if you are really serious about that and give you many opportunities to assign positive meaning this may seem like an obnoxious inconvenience it is one of your greatest opportunities for accelerated growth I in that sense reveled in communicating with a room full of third transitional fourth density being what will express more of the fourth density perspective the more unlimited physical perspective is to establish your vision clarify your definition be clear about expressing your ability to deserve and ultimately clear action which again we will delineate upon further later that is all when you feel you are in third shall I say density limited physical reality you still contain the definition of fourth and are simply expressing the limited point of view you are so limitless that you can impose extreme limitations upon yourself I understand the seems like a paradox seems like an irony but only could that be possible with the great power not that you have but the great power that you are you express that power in each and every given moment of your life so great is that power that you even have the ability to forget completely that it is your power and assign that power one piece at a time to persons places and things within your reality that is merely one definition it is happening to me is a definition you all contain but it is happening from me is also a definition that you all contain and are beginning to express more and more once you constantly express that that will be all you know experientially and you will be fourth density literally right here right now simply continue to grant yourself grant yourself deserved ability you have struggled hard enough long enough even if you buy into the dues paying mentality you're paid up therefore you need not use that definition to hold yourself back any longer everything is due now now is the only time you ever exist now is the time you can transform and I remind you to now be mindful of what you are expressing without invalidating at this timing I wish to thank you all for your willingness to continue to entertain communications from our stream and to entertain us as well you are all as you say in your colloquial slang a riot we are a light race we are a happy race and you have brought us great joy we thank you for it is a gift in that sense that means the universe to us in return for your willingness to function as my equal I thank you I express my unconditional love and ask you how we may mutually be of service to each other shutting then may I can't believe that I didn't know the definition of tonight is going to be but my whole little now yes you did but you can my sharing that I was going to share because right along with these lines and I just suddenly realized that not only am I the messenger but I am the message and in my dreams and I keep kind of running with this message to warn people I am the message I have to give back to myself well the people running from you are simply everything is you in the dream so therefore embrace deliver the message to yourself and I am only a victim of myself when you create that dichotomy but ultimately because you are the creator it is simply an elaborate shall I say game that you choose to play ultimately you are not a victim thank you very much thank you and as long as I get this out before my deserved ability run down now as a simple reminder before you then express the reciprocal it never runs out literally it is infinite literally your cop do flow it over therefore proceed well I would just like to share with you something that I have discovered along the deserve ability line I have been having a lot of trouble in the last six months with intestinal groups of one sort or another every time I eat I get into Justin right after it I have had a headache in my head and I just become pro frustrated because I thought to myself what must I be believing to be having all this difficulty and I came up with the belief that I really don't deserve to exist but I really don't love myself and what happens is I'm very fond of food I don't have to be hungry at all if food is in front of me I devour it and it's the pleasure of eating the food seems to get stuffed down onto the belief that I'm not all right in other words first of all I don't believe I deserve to exist and I don't love myself well I push down I remind you you believe what you have just said and you believe it's reciprocal that I am pointing this out emphatically for a reason to proceed so I've pushed down the feeling first then I put the food on top of it and both of them are very just crumbled inside of me and they're not doing their purpose one way or the other and so I'm resulting in all these things that are going wrong in my inside my body so then I feel guilty for having eaten the food to get rid of the feeling so the whole thing just keep recopically like recopitulating itself well not real you are participating it does not recapitulate itself allow me to ask you a simple question in regards to your deserved ability and listen to the wording what is it that you are still holding on to well not real allow it to be obvious if you feel comfortable that we share it seems stronger or more powerful to hang on to the fear or to try to control the fear then to allow my either my feelings to come out or other people's feelings to come toward me now why because when I was a little girl I had no choice ah when I was abused I had no power to come on I find myself trying to control that was the apparent thing however now you do even in a similar circumstance which is quite unlikely to come along now you do so what do you wish to express in this moment the obvious fact that you do or as you have continued to do recopitulate the fact that you do not now you contain both the least but you are now able to express the preferred belief and it is simply a matter of letting go and in the process are you listening forgiving yourself you have chosen to explore something it may not be completely obvious what although it had become more obvious you continue to ascribe blaring to yourself for exercising that degree of power to be willing to be brave enough to explore that particular idea if you are willing to forgive yourself and understand even if it is not completely obvious in this moment that you know what you're doing you will release what you are holding on to and you will feel the forgiveness seeming to also come exterior but at first in that sense must come from you are you willing to forgive yourself yes are you sure it seems like I had figured out in my mind that if all that is is perfectly creating at all times then all our little cells that are constantly renewing their cells inside our body in other words all that is no manifestation of disease or anything and if we were all that is does contain that expression as well but does not tend to choose it personally again this is quite colloquial but everything in creation is within all that is and is allowed literally particularly if it seems negative only through the unconditional love perhaps you can say all that is that I love you no matter what even if you do this to yourself even if you do this to yourself I still love you so it boils down to your willingness to grant yourself that same respect and what you are holding onto is self-blain and blaming an external perhaps you can say person as well but only will you even find within you any ability to forgive anyone else when you first forgive yourself forgiveness is expressing your divinity you are that beautiful and what you are feeling is you not me I am simply eliciting from you what you already contain feel it that is how the preferred definition feels and begin to see while you are feeling it subtle differences in how you might now act allow the cycles of your life to simply be natural not normal normal is a judgment call natural is who you are you feel like eating something eat it it excites you eat it don't bring along the baggage with it and you may find that it excites you to take the very walk that in that sense as you say burns the calories as an example but do not hang yourself up your willingness to forgive yourself and then in that sense by extension all others involved not condoning anything but simply letting go of the blame and taking back your ability from this point forward to respond taking back your responsibility from this point forward is all you need to to create the effect you prefer is this absurd yes it is but by blocking my emotions when you talk about our flow are you talking about our flow of all our emotions functioning in a nice smooth pattern nothing being out of sync is that what's causing the upset and the disease and people and well in general it is simply denial itself denial of ideas denial of certain beliefs that are denied for so long that they seem in that sense to bring on their own momentum anything you deny strives in that sense to come to your attention so that you can transform it and the more you continue to deny it the more shall I say power you actually imbue it with now this is again at the reasons for creating such a symbol are as numerous as the individuals that do but understand also that it is not an expression of weakness to create this is an expression of extreme power and this will also assist you in understanding where assisting individuals with this ease that it is a disservice to them to feel sorry for them for that matches their own sense of feeling helpless you can have compassion and in that sense reinforce at the same time their power that is truly compassion so therefore treat yourself with that respect it seems to me that as we are creating our body perfectly our body knows how to do that already if we are we harbor a lot of denial and guilt and all that kind of thing so that we have dysfunction going on then the genes and the and the little cells are not renewing themselves perfectly anymore but with this disease manifestation and I wondered if that's how disease came about but you just well understand that there can be these physically counterpart occurrences but understand because you exist fully always in the now no matter how much momentum that may seem to have no matter how much time you may have created to seem to have developed it you can cure yourself realign yourself immediately in any given moment and all those quote unquote physical shall I say echoes will simply seem to have quote unquote miraculously disappeared and there are many examples of this in your society therefore if you in that sense picture yourself at the picture of health begin to use the fact that we have pointed out and discussed that a person with that picture would have particular definitions allow yourself to dialogue and go through this for you will find your own specific significance in this regard allow your emotions to come up perhaps you may wish to sit if they are negative emotions alone in a room in a chair but allow them to come up only when you express your emotions do they deliver the message on their wings so allow them to power and denial is a contracted state of being acknowledgement is an open allowing state of being you have a physical counterpart to that closing down I just want to thank you so much for all the time's events and my questions oh I then repeat after this all right yeah I thank my son you're welcome if I were to give Andrew a hug right now would you feel it and would you feel my energy what I feel you are the idea is that that will be up to you but the sentiment has already been received and we understand the significance so the physical shall I say feedback is not not no I just wondered if if I would feel your energy you know again that would be completely up to you for I remind you that whenever you do you are simply matching it and creating your own version of it any perhaps you would choose that symbol to create it you can simply do so where you are saying thank you very much thank you shut up your eyes reading and I have to burn the press all that are earning the pulse perhaps you just your climate is in the previous intensive I entered that night with only one exciting career idea the water drill cell and you explained it it might be three to five years before it entered the marketplace and I had nothing to replace it as far as a currently available excitement not true but when I left that night I had one thank you very much I had one that came upon and happened and through Frank Dixon that was here that night and it has to do with the job in Washington DC working for every electric power research institute that serves the electric utility industry I am extremely interested in it extremely qualified in that position they're very very close to making their final choice to get that job I have not been able to last far to even get a face to face interview now you are not going to ask for another prediction no can you help me if I get a face to face interview I am confident I can convince him I am the right man for that job do understand when I say everything is synchronicity I truly mean that therefore should you in that sense have such an interview you will in that sense perhaps impress certain individuals but regardless of the outcome do not assume that to be any less synchronicity now I am not in that sense setting you up I am not saying that the outcome will be unpreferred simply that no matter what it is it is the result of certain actions taken through excitement through sincerity and allow anything that occurs to be interpreted positively and acted upon positively and you cannot fail to find what it is you are seeking I believe that that night it was no accident that happened that night and I went away with something that totally surprised me and feels so good but we have discussed with you perhaps in other instances allow it to be what it is not what you insist or assume it must be perhaps that capsulates the point that I am making do you understand I think so I will learn from this experience regardless of which way it goes but it feels so right well no matter what happens to go once that further it is needing you toward something very exciting no matter what happens nothing from this point forward is an interruption in the path that you are unless you assign that and then shall I say hang yourself up so be open acknowledge and allow what occurs to be perfect and keep your eyes open for any quote unquote peripheral opportunities that also exists good advice thank you for that my question number two burning questions as you probably know a couple weeks ago June 10th my brother died okay and I guess my first question is can you please tell me whatever you can about his status right now one more is in that sense what you would colloquially refer to as period of orientation is beginning to get shall I say the understanding that he has actually gone there was a degree of denial around this at first some of the information that we have shared in that sense was expressed and used by so there is a degree of orientation now occur a couple months ago I had an input that may be the emotional and physical discomfort that he had been experiencing really for quite a few months and even two or three years maybe was him sort of cleaning up being cleans of accumulated karma that had accumulated over the last several life times and getting that resolved this this lifetime so then you can play the uh is he aware of what's happened here since he's passed away is that something that perhaps you'll understand that from that point of view he is beginning to understand the service that certain people had been to in the physical life that perhaps at the time he had interpreted at malentat yeah very very appropriate because we ended up having him confined against his will for all 13 days and he decided that maybe I was a male consensus if you will and so for the last three or four months since that day he chose not to communicate with me which is okay because we had tremendous communication before that and understanding no uncertain terms that individuals again in the perhaps you can say colloquially in between state do not generally fixate on but one minute portion or timeframe within the physical life so again perhaps you are quite accurate in understanding that there is the entire understanding of the life well very good thank you very much and to me shut it my eyes good evening and to me um just before you I started talking with the evening I saw your face in my mind well we constantly in that sense are available in that way well I have a question to a group um maybe I would call it a burning question but it's a really important problem to me it's an important question in line with what you are talking about this evening when you have a um an excitement or a goal and anything and then you find yourself maybe in an unpreferred situation but um I would I guess my question would be from your perspective um I don't have anyone signed up for my tours yet and I would like to you know perhaps they would be in in Mexico right may I ask you a question yeah in your fault patterns do you find yourself continuing to express and reassert your intention or in some form continuing to repeat regardless of how you word it no one's signing up no one signing up no one's signing up understand the point yeah I do your clear intention is just that something that you establish and you maintain there comes a point in your reality when you begin to consciously create whereby you will have a choice are you going to quote unquote listen to the clear intention as the establishment of your purpose or are you going to listen to the circumstances in your life which seem to run contrary to the clear intention and that is the cross of this matter simply maintaining that clear intention and allowing yourself to visualize them signing up and every time you find yourself saying no one's signing up understand the universe takes you literally when you say that you believe it you are stating perhaps you do not intend to state it as a premise for the universe to fulfill but the universe takes things quite literally so if you find yourself saying that at least provide the reciprocal you contain again both beliefs no one's signing up and it's bustling at the seams if you are going to constantly reaffirm the negatives at least follow it up with perhaps you can say a booster shot of the preference and another tap on level and also again realize it is up to you to decide to allow your clear intention to be the feedback or the reality the reality is a neutral set of props and only when you assign that things are going contrary to your clear intention do you then seem to create that appearance now put in and another aspect of that would be to trust in the timing well that is all the math with the timing will always be quite obvious either it's right there or it is not if it is not obviously that moment there is something else that you can do which is more constructed towards your clear intention that is the degree of trust that we are seeking on it okay following that a step further when I meditated about this I kept I did several times and I saw myself as an image I think it was me it was a woman with a flower dress and her back was too mean and she turned and the next image was a woman facing me and she had flowers but it was a flower material but it was a suit and then further images for specific flowers one was of a rose and I very clearly thought the leaves and they're I'm doing you know lots of gardening these days and it's something that's giving me a lot of joy well you are doing something else as well blossoming allow yourself to blossom according to preference according to clear intention and again do not allow your reality and the parents a frozen moment in time so to speak to talk you out it is that is it is this a sense yes but something else come on it occurred to me that the reason that the day I saw the further images of specific flowers and then that evening and then they as I went on into that evening I guess maybe half in and half out of the dream state in the next morning I saw other flowers or leaves and things and so it occurred to me that this was also a clue to connect more consciously with those specific flowers or plants that I have seen you are again one with these and allow them as messengers to deliver your version of that message as well we think thank you very much for that oh boy okay well the topic is great I've actually been doing some of those things that you talked about and they've been incredible in terms of my transforming negatives and embracing negatives and turning them into positives and it's been really an almost incredible quite incredible wonderful and understand it was in that sense then for you a simple reinforcement yes kind of a simple but yeah very simple but it is up to you you can complicate your life as much as you but it was the experience I had last week having messages come to me and actually choosing to allow them as opposed to deny them because they were so horrendous to even believe were inside of you but what did you find I found when I actually let the you know the them play on the screen as I watched them and listen that there was a tremendous release and things just shifted there you have to a question was it then obvious that in no way could they ever overcome you and that it was nearly the fear to face them that seemed overcoming and not actually the beliefs themselves that is part of the allowance of providing yourself with definitions that you may wish to change understanding in no uncertain terms that you create nothing nothing that you create is not handleable you're right it was easy because I marveled in that moment and how easily they transformed oh again the complexity the feeling of complexity comes from the fear to face them which is again a stuff position perhaps you can say of a worst case scenario rather than the definition themselves and only can you transform those definitions once you face them so reminding you that you do not create anything that you cannot handle and reminding you that nothing within you can overcome you without your permission will generally loosen the atmosphere to allow you to begin to evaluate your definition do you see and more things came up for me in a dream that night and it was like a tape that just kept going showing me things as I kept thanking myself for these wonderful messages but I guess I'm not even sure what I want to ask you well that was a beautiful shame yeah thank you but it came up before with its first lady and forgiveness is I do know that forgiving is divine and I know that I've touched forgiveness in a dream and I felt an incredible freedom and I guess I felt divinity people will generally assume that they must be creeped forgiveness in fact you continue to be creeped blame so in a sense another way of saying forgiving is continue is anything to continue to assign blame okay it is actually far easier to discontinue the assignment to blame them to continue it actually requires effort to continue absolutely takes a lot of energy to do and and I guess what is you thinking about the very thing you say you don't prefer right so if I know I'd like to well I guess I don't feel this I I'd like to let go with a blame because I know that the only way to release myself and be freer to be who I am in my own life oh something stopping me obviously something inside me now may I ask you a question sir are you sure many times individuals will assign through the assumption of a something a block based on nothing but the assumption of a something ultimately what are you to say to me how can I forgive myself my shall I say most empowering and accurate answer would be go right that is all there is to it and if you then find yourself assigning blame remind yourself I forgave that individual I am assigning blame therefore I am functioning from this set of definitions and then go through the aforementioned perhaps you can say drumming up of the preferred definitions and whatever your favorite for me I think you're losing me oh simply forget it is that simple and if you find yourself then blaming deal with it in the moment reminding yourself that you have forgiven and that in that moment I am creating blame therefore I can choose to see what definitions I must hold in this moment to be creating that blame and realign yourself with the forgiveness the thing that comes to mind here in concrete terms is when I think about I forgive and the freedom that brings the little other voice says which is all in me they don't deserve to be forgiven oh well perhaps you may understand that these voices are both ideas that exist within you get to sit in the middle and choose the one that says they don't deserve it has no more power and ultimately since you choose which one to heed all the power is with you are you willing to take that degree of responsibility for your reality well I realize that there must be a reason why I'm holding on to that belief maybe the other one is too freeing well maybe there is not a reason and that it's simply a tendency because of what you have since you have gotten out of it but when you express the forgiveness and see what you get out of that it will simply be no contest because you contain both beliefs anytime you express one belief yes it will bring along evidence that gives it weight but you are the one expressing the belief creating the evidence you are the one believing then see so providing the reciprocal will in general provide a more preferable way to look at and allow you to remind yourself and realign with the fact that you no longer assign any blame anywhere because you create your own reality right and they deserve whatever they feel they deserve anyway no matter what you say they also have that ability to deserve or that ability to see as though they do not that is not your business thank you for reminding me thank you will that do I think so thank you sir yes you want greasy greetings I have a similar similar instance oh how think yes and being the forgiveness of the perpetrators was pretty easy the hard thing was I was thanking them for assisting me in my experience but without that message or that message would not have been delivered and as I have often drawn the distinction of forgiving is not the same as condoning condoning is doing the same thing that is why you are free to entertain any belief and any thought and evaluate any ideology if you are not doing that thing you are not condoning the ultimate condonement is the action of the thing I'll show them how it feels is condoning what they've just done by showing them look you must be on to something I'm doing it too therefore you can forgive them understand they function from their own health with them forgive yourself and understand that you have gained insight from the experience and move on proceed well I did that last weekend oh what you're ahead of me no no I'm saying I went back and I took a look and see what I made up on the right because if you get a new insight into it and you're for into the issue gentlemen now do understand that I assume they are no longer physically in your life so therefore they will provide a reflection of who you are right now but in general whatever you quote unquote suppose about them may not be at all accurate and will simply aid you in your own exploration the fact that they are no longer physically present shows you that you are no longer of the vibration to physically deal with that's true so perhaps you may release them upon forgiving and need perhaps focus on your your contribution to the interaction rather than theirs so who is showing up for me are people that that are holding on to those same same beliefs that I asked well may I ask you a question do you feel as though your words carry more weight having gone through it yourself so therefore is that not at least one obvious way that it has surgery and others as well yes are you listening up back there Beth yes if that is not a question I was up next question last month we on the second part of the session we all that are clear intentions they're too simple as I saw that I just wanted perspective one is when I was walking towards the building where we I guess we're gonna look at the TV very strong symbol of the inner strength with the and your ability to express a less limited life for density perspective do proceed what was that last part you just said a fourth density perspective which again is still being physical still having a body but being less limited and expressing your limit less next to a higher degree second symbol was a king of rule that came to my other side my left well what is your first impression of that then perceptions of the can't lose playful oh what else what is more obvious than that I guess because the can go came up to me as a track is really I don't know is more than a hobby oh we're just talking around was what you call this out cemsee or food oh next time that you reflect inward take a look and your answer will lie within that is very seeking boy now in a sense I need not be rigid but I have assigned you homework and you are already asking for the answers enjoy the exploration I guess if I ask you assuming it's empty I would revelate your resourcefulness and maintain a mute perspective oh thank you you may all pause for a short break
