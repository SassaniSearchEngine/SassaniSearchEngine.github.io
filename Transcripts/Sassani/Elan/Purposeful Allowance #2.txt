 Alright, allow me to say, if you will, it's your choice. Before we proceed with the interaction, perhaps, just perhaps if this does not apply to you, do not listen. Recently, you may have found tumultuous occurrences in your life, things not going quite according to your preference, a cascading effect of many things which seem to challenge your determination to express yourself in preferred terms. Now, if this does not apply to you, please, by all means, close your ears. We'll call you back when we're done. But the idea is simply this, in many ways. As you begin to transform, you reach and create a threshold, a threshold at which there is an acceleration of your transformation. A very tenuous time indeed is this acceleration. For the acceleration seems to have the effect to support your decisions more fully. And therefore, if your decisions sway back and forth, sway from side to side, swerve all over the road, then the fulfillment of those decisions on what you call reality-based level is quite swift. And therefore, if you are using what you consider to be negative interpretation as evident and continually making decisions based on that, you will find a seeming cascade of negative seeming synchronicity and circumstance. All of this hinges back to what we are discussing this evening of allowing yourself to have the initial interpretation, allowing yourself to notice that perhaps this is not the most positive thing, the most positive seeming outcome. And reminding yourself that it is not the one extraneous thing in the entire universe, and that you can use it to reinforce your decision. Consistency in decision, the allowance of consistency in your decision-making process, is the tool, is the hinge that will allow you to feel the change, to feel the difference. Same old interpretation will yield a same old seeming decision, same old seeming allowance, and same old seeming negative circumstance. But the willingness to use these, and I use the word very literally, apparent sees to reinforce your decision, to not act while having a reaction or a response, allowing yourself to have that response and then realigning and then acting. That is the hinge, that is the tool. If you proceed with the assumption that your reality, by definition, must contain a percentage of miscellaneous extraneous things, you will, by your accelerated transformation, seem to constantly attract them. For willingness to allow yourself to remain focused and use it, whatever it is, to your advantage creates the shift. Therefore, if you seem to have a corresponding continual result that has things coming up that were not as you expected, not what you desire, assume, if you will, assume that to be more important than what you thought you wanted, that what you thought you wanted to do, allow the thing that comes up to do to be more important, to be the feedback from your reality, that now that you have made this decision to be this person, things are going to change, your approach is going to change. The way that you approach a situation is going to change, everything is changed. So therefore, allowing the reality to provide opportunities to do things that you did not plan on doing is an expression of changing right now, being spontaneous, allowing the unexpected to be a gift, a jewel, rather than an interruption. Perhaps to go one step farther diving in and inviting unexpected outcome, and then acting upon the opportunities that it brings, rather than lamenting, I wanted to do this. Instead this is here, what ways me? It is that what ways me? It is not happening, things are not going according to my desires, those assumptions that seem to create this captating effect, rather than, ah, fascinating. I had on my agenda to do this today. I can't do that now, because this has come up. Alright, am I going to focus and lament on that I can't do that now, or am I going to just assume that it just might be possible, that the thing that has come up is more conducive. We'll yield a faster, more direct result than what I assumed, which was still from, more or less, my old approach, to be the thing I need to be doing. And creating a harmonious balance with what is present and using your creations that are present, not needing to be so sculpturing and structuring and controlling about exactly what is happening and exactly what you will do on a given day. All boils down to purposeful allowance, allowing to be what's there to be a reflection of your new decision and diving immediately into how you can use that, how you can do that, understanding if the thing you wish to do that is no longer available is still important, the opportunity to do it will come up, and when it does it will be even easier to do than you had assumed it would be right now. A lot of this is simply trusting purposefully. For you always trust, you always have faith, always, always, always. It's simply what you call doubt. It's not a lack of trust. It is an infinite trust in a negative outcome, an infinite trust in the thing you say you do not prefer, and therefore you can as you purposefully allow, purposefully trust. Nothing is extraneous, something that is unexpected has a pearl within it. And this particular idea can allow you from this moment forward to no longer feel the need to beat yourself up. Now those of you who did not apply to may now come back into the room and plug your ears and we will proceed with a sharing with a female. Hey. I just want to say that was beautiful what you just said and I understood it all and I thank you. I just need some validation on this. Oh, I do understand and I will be more than happy to provide what you are asking that ultimately it is your agreement to whatever I am about to say that will be the validation. I received nearly every answer I had been looking for tonight by the way too. I was just diagnosed with hypodilemia. I did a five hour glucose test and I've been struggling with the worries and concerns about my diet in relation to my physical and my emotional health. All right. Before you proceed. Struggling and worrying are not open receptive postures to allow you to simply express yourself in the most fruitful terms. So first of all, my first suggestion would be let go. Nothing to worry about. Nothing to struggle. Secondly, when you are going about your business expressing yourself purposefully according to the terms of who you know yourself to be. All of these details eating sleeping exercise are automatic. You attract them and if you will, but begin to trust the intelligence of your so called body, which is really just your consciousness in contracted terms, so to speak. The worrying and the doubt are closing you down and by allowing yourself to attract effortlessly whatever substance would be most beneficial to you. That is the conducive posture. Does that make sense? Okay. So you're saying that if I let go and allow the proper. First of all, worrying is an action. It is something you allow yourself to continue to do. So perhaps firstly, you may wish to reorganize that thinking. So that now you are simply taking care of business, not worrying because worrying always has this background underlying notion that something's going to get you. So nothing is going to get you if indeed you understand that your life is an effortless reflection of who you choose to be. So do I have the full capability to create perfect emotional physical and emotional health within myself? What do you all do? No matter what I would eat or drink, so to speak, you may find as you do so what you eat or drink is a result again and not the cause. Understand, the idea of eating is largely symbolic. You are an infinite being. You have no beginning, middle and ending. So the idea of external substance is an exploration. Your body exists within your consciousness, not the other way around, and your body is an expression of your consciousness. So even any particular condition that you can share with me is an expression of consciousness. Generally in that case, you are simply not allowing yourself to be natural with yourself and creating a dichotomy. And you can simply realign yourself to who you are and everything else so to speak falls into place. As you transform your consciousness, your body transforms. There is a vast approach in physical reality that individuals need to prepare their body, change their body, transform their body to now allow for the expansion of their consciousness. And this efterancy can be experienced, but it is illusory, truly. First comes the shift in consciousness, then comes the shift in body. So also remind yourself of that. Is this helpful? Yes. Is there anything else? I entered my spine a number of years ago and I truly believe I have the power to heal myself and to believe that it is no longer there. I guess I just want some validation on that also. Oh, do you still feel what you call pain? Do you ascribe that pain to a past injury? Can you perhaps entertain the idea of each instance of that pain being completely in the moment with no path and looking at what it means in that moment, looking at how it reinforces your decision in that moment and looking at what it allows you the opportunity to do in that moment? Can that approach at least be something you might give a shot? You will notice a difference if you do so. Or it is not truly again something that happened in the past that is causing the pain now. You create the pain now and very strongly identify it with the path which is the only thing that creates the relationship. Now I understand that seems to be a bit odd for your general mass consciousness way of thinking. But nevertheless it is the mechanism and by continuing to assign a path you get the absolute seeming effect that you had an injury and what you are feeling now is from that injury and you perpetuate to whatever degree you do. That you do not need to and it can simply be treating it in the moment as something that has to do with what is going on right now with you and not the path. Then things will stand out as to what is going on right now. Why might I feel pain right now? Pain is resistance. What am I resisting right now? Forget yesterday, forget the day before, forget the injury. What am I resisting right now? If you are willing to be in the moment, if you are willing to put that baggage aside, always will you find something right now that you are obviously resisting. Then the pain has been a mess in sure. Then you will begin to address the things you are resisting and allow them. As you begin to change that approach you no longer need to create the messenger to show you you are resisting. You are resisting. You are resisting. Do you understand? Yes, thank you. Well thank you I have done nothing. I am a female. I was born on an island in Canada at the age of, I was struck by lightning in April. Oh, how is it? Was that your experience? No, I mean the following winter I saw a very powerful image that was in life. It was a huge, three children were sharing the same bedroom. I could not see any, it was like a silhouette with white light around it like a club figure. It seemed rather large of course being a child, everything seemed harsh. But it is not as negative to my brother and my sister and not as to me positive. Describe and define what you mean by not as positive, not as negative. It was accepting me. Oh, it did not tie your shoes. I understand. I just mean my brother told me a few years ago that he said he had seen it. 20 years later and since then my life has changed. I mean I have predicted many family deaths. While they were happening I have experienced their death while I was, well I have never heard that. It has changed my entire life. Do you feel as though you exhibit what you might refer to locally as increased sensitivity? Yes. Oh, now make a comment and you can simply do it with you will. My understanding of what you are describing and how I am able to scan the event was that just in case this was your interpretation. The lightning strike was not the cause of the increased sensitivity. It was the effect of it which it already had existed. Do you feel see? I was just wondering do you know the origin of this being? It went out the window and straight below there was a veranda with fresh fallen snow and there wasn't any footprints or anything. What is your interpretation of the impact of having witnessed this being has had upon you to use your own turf? It tells us there is something very special but I don't know what the purpose is. I mean I have had your life, so I was a cat. I wouldn't have any more lives left. I'm just a... Very literally this being entity energy which you would perhaps call extra dimensional in many ways functions as what you might perceive to be or what you commonly call guide consciousness. Are you finding that you are able to communicate with this being or have you even as you say they may be attempts to do so? Yes, friends of mine have experienced it. That's what it's called as many visions of very complicated. I believe evil forces as well as very... I don't know how to explain this. What is your interpretation of the being nodding negative to the other individuals? I mean think that if we saw that this being I saw as a child was good. Oh, and what was your interpretation of the negative nod to the others? That I was being selected. Ah, accurate. I was just simply asking to see whether you had a negative interpretation of that. Oh, and what is your question? I guess I'm trying to find out what my purpose in life is. Every time I seem to make advances and feel as long as going along in a positive manner, it's like I said if I live in Catwood's Nine Lines, I wouldn't be. I mean, I've had near-a-death experiences. It's like I'm being knocked back. May I ask you a question? Yes. Oh, thank you. In your most natural state of understanding yourself, what is it that you would see yourself doing in your life that is most exciting and at the same time fulfilling to you? Uh, painting spiritual limitations. Oh, right. Does anything else stand out? Um, working with children? Oh. Anything else? Doing what you're doing? All right. What am I doing? That seems to be happening to me, channeling and saying words and things that I've never heard of before. Oh. Well, then I thank you for answering your own question. For you are all consummate experts at what your purpose is. Now, first of all, your purpose in life overall where you say I have a one purpose is to simply be the best version of yourself that you can possibly be most fully, most purposefully, most consciously. Your sub-purposes, if you will, your situational circumstantial purposes stand out in relief from the infinity of possibility as the things that are exciting to you. That you feel passionate about that attract you that you can act upon with integrity, which is simply the knowingness that all things exist within you and are an extension of you. And so therefore, unless you find that this should change for you, those are your purposes. What you call channeling, what you call working with children and what you call the visual art. Now, to what degree have you committed to do these things? As to what degree do you resist doing them? I seem scattered with it. I seem like I only have so much energy and every time I tell you. By the way, you do have an infinite amount of energy, but we'll get into that later perhaps. Do you find that you are effectively doing any one of the three? All right, then, perhaps as a simple means of focus. Lay them all out before you. Allow your sense of discernment to be obvious in that one of them will stand out as steaming right now. The only time there is right now has more exciting than the other two. And do whatever degree you have at your resources to do so, do that thing. You will no longer be scattered. You will create something. Whatever you create will have an effect, and then new opportunities will present themselves that you can then choose between of the same criteria, which one stands out as being the most passionate and most exciting. Does this seem at all desirable? Using your sense of discernment to define your own sense of purpose, then all there is left to do is to purposefully allow yourself to do so. Period. And I assume when you do, you'll sound just a tad bit more excited about it. How is this warning about the origin of this being? The origin of this being is what you would call very ancient ties to yourself without necessarily needing to be too specific. Perhaps it would be more relevant to what you would perceive or consider to be lives or incarnations that are generally apart from your earth lives or earth incarnations. However, there is also a direct earth relationship there as well. But simply it is a pat on the back, a loving nudge, a loving nod, and it is still you and your power that creates. And by being willing to focus that power as a lightning bolt, you will find very quick acceleration of positive results from that commitment, so to speak. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Where is this, as you say in your vernacular, hanging up for you? Or I assume we're a person to say to me, you can now do your most exciting thing, I might be a bit enthused about it. Where is your hesitation? Where is the resistance coming from? I think I lack confidence in being able to make a lively good other than teaching with painting or with, I mean I've been on my own since I was 16 and financially. I'm hesitant about trying to make it in the painting world. May I ask you a question? Have things that do not excite you and are not a reflection of your joy and passion. Have such things ever supported you in your life. Yes? Well, I do teach children, I do teach them wrong. I understand, but what I am asking is have you found that certain things do support you even though they are not very exciting to you? I think she does. It's like a part-time job. Have you been able to support yourself? Yes, I have. When you are able to support yourself, are the things that you are doing to support yourself exciting or not? Yes, I know. Yes, I know. Well, there are things that you do that do not excite you, that do support you. Always. Where then do you have the assumption that something that does excite you, which tells you it is a direct reflection of who you are and remember you are extra sensitive to these things, have any less likelihood of supporting you at least as much, if not more, than something that is completely unrepresentative of who you are. Where did this assumption come from? Now, you do not need to answer for it. It is not really important where the assumption did come from. You are expressing that assumption. And by simply being willing to shift your point of view to look at it that way, things that have not excited me have supported me. Therefore, something that does excite me that I would be fully committed to. Spring out of bed energetically in the morning to do has a slight advantage to support me. Over things that truly make me miserable. Does this make any sense? Is this thinking in? Are you slightly more excited about the visual art or is this now? Yes, I am. If I were to tell you, you can be rich with your art. What would your response be? I don't think about being rich. You can support yourself abundantly and do whatever you wish to do, only having your art as a thing to do. What is your response to that? My art means more to me than in a materialistic fashion. How will you? Does that preclude the idea of allowing it to support you abundantly, however? I'm sorry, I'm sorry, can you just... The idea is this. There are built-in assumptions going on with many of you. That's the thing that brings you passion. For some reason, perhaps it's too good to be true. Cannot support you or will not support you. That is a decision that you make. Perhaps it has never been posed to you that way that you have defined yourself, decided this is who I am and built into that decision. That's the thing that you are most passionate about, which as I have said is your purpose, at least for now, to your passion shifts, cannot support you. And the idea is it can support you and it can support you beyond things that support you that you are halfheartedly committed to. And so in introducing this idea and in introducing the idea that you deserve that what brings you passion can also support you, how does that feel? That would be wonderful. You now sound like you mean it. Now if I tell you beyond the shadow of a doubt, this can be true for you, how does that feel? Great. I still have some heads and heads and heads and heads and heads and heads. I have to be honest. That is simply because you are not agreeing with me. But you can start at the stage of entertaining what I am saying and as it becomes that much more attractive, it begins to take on the weight of something that becomes most desirable to you, which is enough to motivate you. Now I do not by any means ask you to take my word for it. Words who have happened that you did and then you got the emotional feeling of joy that you get. I would have simply told you the joke is on you. It is all you. And I am simply a symbol of how it would feel if you make the decision. So perhaps for now, entertaining what I am saying, it seems to have shifted your posture and begin to realize that nothing is too good to be true. Expressing yourself doing the thing that brings you joy and passion, which only adds to yourself, adds to your planet, adds to your society, is completely deserving of compensation that allows you to express yourself and survive as you say effortlessly and abundantly. And because this is a desirable idea to you, that is the first step toward considering allowing yourself that degree of freedom. Are you willing to play around with that? All right, then you will draw to yourself new opportunities, so to speak. Thank you very much, I appreciate it. And I, too, you as well, for we all gain from these interactions. Shutting! No! Hey! Greetings, my friend. I know you! Believe. Secretistically, I saw a film the other day about, it's about mother's rate, and what I got from it was that you can accept things where they are. And I, by the way, that does not necessarily mean for settle for things that you do not desire, but it allows you to at least start out working with what's there. And so the distinction is drawn between settling for something because it is less than you desire and expect versus using something because it's right there to use. I found it pretty sobering just because it helped me to just relax into some things that I was pretty stressed about, just accepting and allowing them to be what they are, not trying to create some, not trying to push it. You know, you can't push the river, and it was a nice thing that released a lot and keeps a nice little fight in the night. By the way, I thank you for the analogy, which has been in that sense expressed to members of your society before, which is the idea that you cannot stop the flow of the river by the idea of controlling and forcing, but by allowing and purposeful allowing you can divert its flow to the direction that you desire. Excellent analogy, proceed. Thank you. My question is actually, a lot of them have been answered tonight, which is really nice and great, and I didn't even expect to speak. All right, but what? I didn't know what I did. Actually about three symbols that have been coming to me. One is about hand gestures. In different cultures, we've all said that they have different hand gestures, even Andrew's having gestures when he speaks, as you speak. And the Eastern Indians have gestures that are very profound, and I've wondered if you could comment on that at all. Simply again, there are many different interpretations for gestures, but would you in that sense like to participate in the following idea more or less, and I say this loosely. A universal gesture for I come in peace is the idea that you would perceive as your arms down like this and slightly out. And were you to approach, for instance, a member of my society in this way, it would be quite understood that you are embracing us, so to speak. I'm sorry. I was speaking more about the one they called the Guillain-Muntro, actually, I think, and it's opposed to the index finger accustomed to the thumb. You've seen the companion's with Jesus had it too, and I was wondering about that energetically. What is that doing into the body? What is it doing to the individual at that time? In a sense, it is a symbol of completing the circuit in that sense, closing and allowing yourself to function as a whole. It is largely symbolic, but can also be experienced in what you call energetic terms. Many individuals will meditate in that posture as well. Where it closes the circuit, but again, this is all quite arbitrary. You are the circuit, and the reality that you exist within is connected to the circuit that you are. Yeah, I know that, but there's been a culture that has been given us for a long time. Body language, yeah. I think it's like patricle, and then eventually the alphabet. There are certain symbols in your society, which are also quite negatively interpreted, which I will not demonstrate at this time. However, to other societies, that may be, in a sense, affectionate display. Somehow I'm doing a repeating test. Actually, the second symbol is about the idea of fasting. We were talking about spews we eat, allergies we soak up for, are creative, and different things we can do for our bodies, coming from the outside in. Now, when one's fast, for some reason they go through a cleansing, and they're really sure. Well, generally again, the idea is that they are beginning to, and this is all quite symbolic. I will use your language, but it is not accurate, cleanse their consciousness, which generally means begin to be more purposeful about their expression, and everything else falls into place. But the idea of no food, no substance, coming in with the body, but fluids, that's the pain to the body. What is the thing that it's blending? For a breath, self-sufficiency, the idea of not relying on external sustenance, perhaps using that opportunity to turn within, to allow yourself to not need to be nurtured from an external source. That is one conceptual way to look at it. I've adapted recently quite a long time, and I've really cleansed out a lot. I was able to breathe so clearly. I was a different person, not to mention what you always are. I've never seen God in a few days. The thought of your way to higher consciousness. By the way, look in the mirror, you can do that any time. It was amazing. I thought, oh my God, it was a nice thought. He didn't really feel like this all the time. But that's not what I wanted to do after 4 days. I was like, I want to eat now. All the way. I was just interested in then mechanism. We were just talking about foods and substance and how we take it in. Right now, my body is coming through a lot of changes. I have fatigue. I have all these things that were mentioned tonight. I know that there are inner stuff going on. You can ascribe it to what you call the Bill of Goods that surrounds you, or you can simply realize, what causes fatigue conceptually, consciously. What am I resisting? I'm resisting myself. What is it about myself I wish to express? You come up with that answer, are you doing it or not? Plain and simple. When you are willing to commit and dive into what it is, you know to be true for yourself. The infinite reservoir of energy that you are, not that you possess, not that you express, but that you are, is at your disposal. When you are willing to allow, rather than resist, you have all the energy you need. It is very tiring to resist yourself. And so therefore, should you choose not to resist yourself, should you choose to dive into purposely expressing who you are, all of these other issues, again naturally fall into place. You are attracted to drink this. You are attracted to eat fat. You will find yourself not hungry in circumstances where you used to be. And if you will trust the mechanism of how you attract your reality, allow yourself to be in the moment about it, you will find what is generally referred to as obsessive types of eating, excessive types of behavior will simply transform, for they are no longer relevant to a person committed to being themselves most fully. These are types of pacifications and external sweeping that result from resistance of the self, not allowance. So allow yourself to be yourself fully, dive into it, trust it, and revel in the joy of the results that you get from no longer withholding who you are. When you no longer withhold who you are, you get into synchronous flow with your reality and whatever inflow and outflow that you attract and expel will be natural like taking a breath. Absolutely. Thank you. Thank you, Lesma. Briefly. All right. One moment. Simply, in closing, you are the river. You cannot damn yourself up, but you can divert yourself toward the direction that is most representative of who you are effortlessly. Allow that to sink in. All right. All right. Thank you. Timale. Timale, I wanted to pleasure you to be here this evening. Oh, and with you as well, though, I am not physically present. Thank you. I have had this feeling every time I was a little girl of incredible and incredible energy. Incredible energy, of course you have. Incredible energy with an essential of my chest. I am a very energized, energetic person. I do lots of creative things. But when I see something or feel something, this feeling that comes through me is so powerful. The only way I feel that I can express it is usually through... It's not that it's a sad situation and sometimes it is. Do you have an extra moment? You are the river. You can allow yourself to express it. Allow yourself to have any of the natural, shall I say, responses to it. And the more you are willing to express it and not hold it back, the less difference you will seem to feel with what you call your normal state of consciousness. And I feel that I really do do that. I allow myself to deal with what comes up. My question is, how can I use this energy in a more positive light or to kindle it in a way that is of a......the highest good? It's a disgraceful appreciation that you feel in physical terms. In other words, you feel something, you have an appreciation, your attention is upon something. Now what can you physically go and do with it? And you will find that to be, shall I say, the piece of the puzzle you are speaking? Do you understand what I am saying? Move your body around. Get involved. Do something with it. Allow your very action to be the expression of it, rather than merely a passive response, so to speak. You will find this to be useful and motivated. And I feel that I really do that in many, many different ways. Have you creatively created new ways? Yes. Have a good time. Shitting. Hey. Greetings. Good friend. The feeling is mutual. Thank you. By the way, that goes for all of you. Let's not singling him out. I've spoken many times in here of frustration with not being where I want to be in my career. Oh, first time for me. New bookies. And I took a big step in February. I went to California and took this program that would train me to go out and teach organizations how to pollute less and be more environmentally sustainable. It was really hard experience for me because it involved a lot of public speaking, which basically nervous. And I didn't think I was going to make it, but it turned out that I did well in it. And by the way, you're not expecting surprise for me, are you? I mean, it felt like what I wanted to do, but it took a tremendous amount of effort for me to get out there and do it and show up and ask. They have to have a question. Fundamentally. Fundamentally. Did it really take so much effort? Or was it perhaps the resistance to doing so that made it seem that way? And other words, when you actually got up, isn't it truly accurate that it was no big deal? Well, there were some really magical experiences when I could let go of the fear and just speak, and it came out very well. But there were times when I was really petrified. Would you be willing to perhaps redefine what you are calling petrified as the idea of intense excitement with the slight negative interpretation? Yes, I would definitely do that. I'm sure it's true. The question that I had is I'm still experiencing a version of that now in my life. Since I've come back, things are accelerating. Like you've said, I'm meeting a lot of interesting people. Other career opportunities are opening for me that seem interesting. And this seems like an opening to a doorway in my career that I want to be out expressing not only the environmental stuff, but more of the things that you talk about here. And at the same time, I've been feeling a lot of fear, which I think has been leading me to do stuff like compulsively eat, or at times act in old patterns. Or, you know, the American... Oh, man, make a suggestion. It is my perception, and by all means, stop me if you do not agree, that it is not so much the fear that we are discussing. It is, again, and for the first time, the fear of the fear. And that actually, just the fear itself is only a minor hesitation. But being afraid to be afraid compounds the idea. And ultimately, allowing yourself to feel afraid is the expression of being willing to embrace and use the fear rather than resisting the fear by being afraid of it. Is this getting too confusing? Well, I'm supposed to present this one day seminar a week from today. But it is my perception, although it is not generally my practice to say so, that it will go very marvelously. Do proceed. Really? Okay. It wasn't even clear that it was going to go forward at this point. It's scheduled, but they were talking about canceling it. And with the question I try to... Perhaps you will have more of a participating role in that. Do proceed. The... What if that's how then could I use the fear that I have around that in a positive way? Let it go. Feeling it. Then talk to it. But first, feeling. Let it play out. Fear is not an infinite emotion that never ends. Only resisting the fear, being afraid to fear, or not allowing yourself to fully trust that that emotion in this instance right here, right now, will bring you a little tidbit of information that you can use. When you're finished fearing, because all these emotions, when you finally allow yourself to feel them, get to the point where you go all right now what? Then the information is bare and useful. And ultimately it is always the same thing that will transform it completely, which is standing up and doing the thing. Are you willing to face and embrace that fear? Are you standing that you've already done it many times and it has never overwhelmed you? It's true. I'm willing to do it and I will do it. Are you willing to go one step further and assume that just maybe? Perhaps. You can use something in there. Oh, yes. Then get excited and find what that is. And suddenly fear becomes anticipation. It could be a motivator to do a good job. Well, you will do a good job now, won't you? Oh, so slick. Are you willing to commit to it? Commit to doing a good job. Yeah. Then there is no room for hope, is there? All right. On your way. And I thank you. For you have spoken marvelously at this gathering and allowed other individuals to also glean from what it is you are exploring. Do not think, unless you insist, that you're the only one that feels this. There was another question that I wanted to ask if that's okay about relationships. I've often felt that once I got beyond the block in my career that I would attract in a partnership for a long-term relationship. It feels like that could happen, but there's also a lot of neediness and fear of rejection around meeting the woman that I was married. Is that who you see yourself to be, needy and fearing rejection? Or if you had your druthers, would you perhaps decide to define yourself in slightly different terms? Yeah, so I agree to find myself. Allow yourself to be in touch with how you define yourself. And then when that comes up, it is simply an idea to realign back to the preferred decision. Period, which makes it very useful. And each time it comes up, a wonderful opportunity. Do you understand? Everything that you implement has worked. Again, not to say anything that we are suggesting is any better than anything anyone else is doing. But has it not performed flawlessly when you employ it? It has worked, and there's been some amazing synchronicity in my life lately. When you employ it consistently, then the synchronicity takes on a whole new momentum. And what many of you have experienced as a barrage of negative occurrences becomes a barrage of positive synchronicity. A barrage of opportunities appearing seemingly from nowhere, which we have sometimes referred to as the ecstatic explosion of coincidence and synchronicity. Up to you. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Shady, may I? Hey. And to you. I want to focus on the most powerful force in the universe. Oh, I go right ahead. Which is of course wrong. Okay. I totally accept and understand and believe in the ideas of that we're all equal, that we all have divinity within an unconditional love and life's attract. I understand and accept all that. What I want to focus on is those special relationships that somehow or other seem to have a magical aspect to them. And end up somehow with a passionate romantic relationship. What is the source of that? The source of that special situation is yourself, your recognition of celebrating yourself and your approach as to whether you look at a relationship as the opportunity to attract another complete individual to both share this idea with, in which case you are creating an empowered situation or whether as many individuals often also do, you see yourself as half a being needing to attract your other half. So the idea is by completely stating who you are being willing to be, who you are consciously and then allowing that relationship to be a reflection of that all miss the relationship takes on the characteristic of all miss. And in terms of why you attract one individual versus another, again, it depends upon how you are choosing to express yourself and again, therefore vibrate. And as to whether that vibration will harmoniously allow someone to seem to stand out in relief. So the more willing you are to be yourself fully, the more likely you are to attract a direct reflection that will complement that idea. The more you are resisting yourself and expressing yourself in a broken series of intentions only can anything you attract reflect that. So you never get away from yourself and in a relationship need not be something you escape to but simply a celebration of what is. With the idea of vibration as you just mentioned, does, and you used the word earlier tonight, a resonance takes place. Absolutely, can you not feel it? And then that builds up into a synergistic sort of thing with the passion and the romance and so forth. All right. That explanation will do, yes. But you have to have similar vibrations, I guess, for all these resonance to this place. Generally speaking, yes. Is there something underlined? Let me come at a different angle here. Aww. Aww. A few years ago, somebody asked a marvelous question. Aww. A couple of years ago since the last model was... Aww, aww. That was jealous of the question. What it was was. To a year, the question even asked for changes, you must contain it. So pack yourself on the back and proceed. They took the words out of my mouth. Of the roughly six billion souls on this planet, the question was about how many over souls account for an energy. For those six billion. And after a pause, and here second year data based and so forth, the answer was roughly 2.8 billion. It is an arbitrary figure and perhaps I would even retract it. Close that up. But it's useful for my next question. Oh, all right. Then I give it back out. Let me add average of like two people on this planet per over soul. My question is, does my over soul have somebody else on this planet right now besides me? In a sense, yes, but you must understand when discussing these types of mechanics that it all depends on your point of entry of where this discussion takes place. What you refer to as the idea of soul, separate souls from the one all that is or God is only a point of view. Ultimately, you are all the same one over soul. There can be the apparent if you are exploring a similar type of overall theme in a physical reality that you would share an over soul that is separate from the one over soul. But it is truly, perhaps you can say somewhat inaccurate and somewhat of a description which lends itself to separation. Therefore, the most integrated answer is you are all one being. The other way to look at the supposed breakdown which you're simply illusory designations with which you group certain explorations by is you can experience the transparency of having souls that are separate from the all that is, that then have over souls, that then have over souls that ultimately wind up being the one all that is over souls. But this gets quite complex. You need not relegate the marvelous creation of unconditional love flowing in two directions to simply a linear explanation that is contracted compared to the more expanded realization that you are all one being. And nothing gets closer than one being. So what do you want to take back the answer to? We all left aff and inclined to perpetuate answers which were provided for a linear standpoint and now become more or less obsolete as your view becomes more infinite if you're part of the term, more infinite. You may from time to time hear a retraction, hear and there. It is not a negating. It is arising to the level of what you are now willing to accept and explore. And again, I remind you, it is a romantic notion. I and this other individual share this over soul that is separate from everyone else's over soul. But it is just as romantic and passionate a notion to be reflections of one being. That is intimacy. That was the question I was trying to lead up in corner you want. I'm trying to corner with very classy. This magic that somehow pops up into a relationship could it be? Why? That they have the same over soul and if they did, would that account for such a special magical feeling? For the purposes of wrapping this up and being very, very accurate, if you say so. Do you understand? If I believe it, then it is true. I have that going on in my life right now. From what I just answered, you will need to tell me. I know what I prefer to believe. What? I have some relationships that are, I have some real magic in them and there's something special. I'm just trying to understand the source of the cause, the possible cause of it. Then I will not negate any of that. Thank you for your willingness to share it. Do ponder the intimacy of all being one over soul. You need not minimize that and that does not mean that certain facets or aspects of the whole cannot do a very beautiful and wonderful dance within the expression of the whole that has meaning, has passion, has fullness and fulfillment and is a relevant statement in creation. Listen to this tape. You are the tape. At this timing before we depart, we simply request a question from our friend, the adorable. Thank you a lot. A question of statements or both? Well, that was a question and a statement now, wasn't it? Perhaps if you allow me a statement. Well, thank you. We always honor the idea of someone willing to put something forth purposely as an expression of who they are, do proceed. Okay, in that we are mirrored balls, it's important to recognize, it seems to me, that we mirror to a great extent what the term, the mass consciousness. Yet often, it's not understood clearly what mass consciousness is. Mass consciousness in my view has a base in certain doctrines. By the way, it does because you say so for you, just to keep it on an empowered basis, do proceed. Okay, currently our civilization appears to be based upon a basal paradigm I call materialistic scientism. By the scientism being science as religion, our materialism being a seeing is believing. Yes, it seems believing. Our own. Okay, and materialism being the idea that only the material is really real. All seeing is believing. Okay, in terms of specifics, it is the Darwinism that constitute the basal paradigm, classical Darwinism 1859, social Darwinism which expresses that state socialism in our century, and neo-Darwinism. In the view of the neo-Darwinists, our orthodox biologists, life is a struggle. These guys see even the genetics as involved in a struggle for dominance. So that is what our mass consciousness is currently, but always change a valid way to describe one version of a duplicate. Yes. I think what is coming is the new basal paradigm. I call it scientific holism. Basal. Basic underlying. Paradigm change. Do proceed. Defining terms. Right. I believe that the new terms in the paradigm will be understood in this way. Creation. The particulate or particular form of all that is. The process of one becoming the other, involving desire, splash, allowance, where desire is dependable as an expression of purpose. The whole process summarized in the phrase purposeful allowance. If indeed you define creator as waveform, what creates the waveform? In that model? I believe the waveform is the primary thing. Is that separate from the idea of creation? Are you perhaps speaking about vesicles of physical creatorhood? Specifically when referring to it as waveform as opposed to primary creative? Possibly. I'm using the analogy of light having basically two forms of waveform in particular. The visible or physical universe is the particulate aspect of the all of this. For the creator wave. I understand the analogy. What is its usefulness? What is its purpose? To collapse the separateness between the idea of creator and creation. How does defining one as a wave and one as a particle do that? Does that not perpetuate the separation? Here's another way to look at it. Not at all invalidating what you are saying. Is to understand that particles and wave are simply different aspects of the same phenomena. Both of which emanate from creation and within which there can be seemingly vesicles of separate. In terms of physical reality, creation vesicles. For those of you who feel that this is very technical, bear with us. Yes, I can see that. Describe then the result of your new paradigm as you describe it. The result is the clear understanding as the basis of mass consciousness that each of us is part of the whole. Would not perhaps the next step in realization be the idea that the whole is you? Without any longer relegating yourself to simply part of a larger whole. Yes, I can have that too. And that would pull in lines in the idea that the memory of the whole system would be encoded in each particular aspect of the system. All the graphic marks understood. So as this new basal paradigm comes into existence, it will be... By the way, just to get technical, it's not new, but do proceed. It has been occurring in versions, in pockets, in aspects throughout physical reality throughout all of what you call time. But I understand that it is generally from the way you are laying down this discussion a new approach to what you are referring to as a mass consciousness, which I assume your definition of is the conglomerate energy of individuals. That's right. So, this is truly scientific. I believe it would be just so much easier for each of us to realize whatever ambitions we might have more and more on an accelerated basis. So can we then summarize this idea to be? Previously, and heretofore, the approach of the mass has been seeing is believing. The new idea that you are beginning to, in that sense, express and expand towards is believing is seeing. Period. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. At this timing, allow me for the first time and once again to thank you all for your willingness to allow me to interact and reflect back to you who you already are and what you already contain. I will simply close in saying that it is your allowance. You earned it. Spend it any way you wish. I bid you all a most fond and loving. Good evening.
