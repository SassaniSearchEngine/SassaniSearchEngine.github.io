 Greetings, this evening of your time as you create time, how are you all? All right. Allow me to begin this interaction with the title, the signers of meaning and understand before we proceed that you, each and every one of you, are the signers of meaning in your reality. Allow us to explain and apply this in several areas. We have many times discussed and perhaps those of you who have not participated in this interaction have heard the notion before that all situations, all events are, shall we say, a neutral set of props which contain no built in meaning. You assign that meaning, therefore you are the signers of meaning. The meaning that you assign determines the effect that you get out. Perhaps you can say prior to the assignment of that meaning, all right, perhaps you can say, life is truly meaningless. But then you assign the meaning and again the tone with which you assign that meaning determines the effect that you get out, the experience that you get out from that particular instance. So therefore, given any neutral situation that occurs in your life, if you apply and assign a negative meaning, you in general will then receive a negative effect. If you take same situation, same parameters in place and assign a positive meaning by perhaps asking how this serves me rather than is happening to me, you then from the very same set of neutral props get a positive response, a positive result. Therefore you truly do create your own reality and you truly do set down the tone for doing so through your assignment of meaning, through your choice of definitions, how you define your reality to be. One of the definitions that very often individuals will apply to their reality is that changing yourself must be a complex process. Now we understand that your consciousness and your reality is rich and full of complexity and diversity, but the living of the actual life, the making of the actual changes are actually quite simple. So therefore your definition that change is difficult has you acting differently than if you assume change is simple and it is ultimately those actions that you perform from the assignment of the meaning that shall we say delivers the physical effect in your physical life. So what is always up to you if you do decide that things are quite complicated to understand that you have assigned that meaning and that are you to assign the meaning of simplicity in action, you can then perhaps approach the situation from a slightly different angle and perform the actions that reflect your willingness to see the simplicity of how it can be in your life to change. For change once again is a neutral idea, it is a constant in your reality. Then again the assignments that it must be a complex series of steps or processes then has you acting in a way where you shall we say seek out those processes and will only allow yourself to truly validate a change if there is first a process so that you can perhaps have worked to earn it. But understand that the moment you decide to change that decision is a statement that decision allows you to express that change from that moment forward. Another meaning that you sometimes will assign perhaps can be illustrated by the following analogy and we have used this sometimes before. If you have a cube and all sides of that cube are painted a particular color and you in that sense change or paint one side a slightly different color. Two different ways to look at that one same neutral cube are as follows. Number one same cube slightly different change same cube different face but another way no less valid that one can't assign or interpret it is now that it is an entirely different cube by definition. Now if you reflect on this a moment it is obvious that both ideas are true and it is simply a matter of which you assign it how you choose to look at it. The effect you get perhaps even in the cube example or analogy will be determined by that assignment of meaning. If you in that sense assign is just the same cube with a slightly different side then your attitude toward that cube will reflect that and you will get the effect of it being just the same cube. But should you understand it to be an entirely different cube now and perhaps gear your attitude and assignment toward the differences in speaking and finding what those differences are your experience of again the same exact cube can now be fresh can now be fascinating can now be as if it is a new. It is because you have chosen to look at it that way and this by extension can also be applied to your life to your reality for if you make one minor little change you can choose to look at it as same old boring life with a little tiny change or entirely different reality entirely different scenario and set of events for once anything has changed it has all changed and it is up to you in how you will choose to look at it. If you should choose to believe that it is simple to change your reality if you should in that sense utilize any change as a grand and sweeping change across the entire reality you can then read the benefits of that change in accelerated timing very quickly as you say and again should you assign when making any change within yourself that it has all changed your actions would differ from the actions that you would assume if you believed it was just a different slightly different change in the same old life. If you believed it to be again same life slight change you would then be looking for the similarity in the new changed reality as the old reality and perhaps then say see I told you it didn't change but then how could you have experienced it as a change when all you did in that instance was a sign that it was really a very little change however should you decide that fundamentally any change is a change across the board that has you then looking and seeking to see the differences rather than the similarity you can either allow the similarities to validate the lack of change or you can be very active in seeking out the differences to validate the change same set of circumstances different assignments entirely different effects therefore you are always in that sense able to be active in the assignment of meaning in your reality for it is up to you you get to choose and if you say it is not up to me that is your choice that is the choice you have made and in any given moment should you decide I have no choice as you have made a choice though perhaps that choice is not reflective of the choice that you would prefer and again is concentrating on the similarities rather than the differences your willingness to validate that everything has changed has you in that sense beginning to with fascination begin to seek once again the way that things have changed the subtle differences the evidence that corresponds to the change rather than the same old idea for either way you will be actively engaged in the process what we are suggesting is that you can now become conscious purposeful about it and do it according to your intention rather than randomly your willingness to approach any given situation in your life from the perspective that it has no built in meaning perhaps for example a particular situation comes along the silently speaking you have been taught that every time this situation occurs it is bad it is negative oh everyone knows that then you assign it the everyone knows negative meaning and get the negative effect and there is the evidence well everyone was right but you can always turn this around you can say and acknowledge what perhaps everyone usually says is wrong with the event but not settle for that for you understand I create my own reality I in that sense am experiencing an event that is my creation it seems on the surface to be quite bad however if I acknowledge my creatorhood I will look at why I created it not look at the face of it to say well of course I would never create that so the form of in that sense taking back your power comes from your willingness to phrase in the form of a question how is this creation serving me exactly the way it is exactly the way it presents itself how does it serve me I see what is obvious and negative seeming about it but that does not serve me other than to perhaps let me know that I do not prefer this therefore perhaps it has aided me in myself definition but if you are willing to look a bit further you will always find some way that any situation is of conscious positive service to you but only only from your willingness to begin to decide that you wish to assign the meaning that will be of service to you for when you automatically say that's bad you are assigning that meaning anywhere so we are not asking you to do something that you're not very good at simply now pointing out that you can be conscious about it you can decide just decide to change if in that sense changes what you would find desirable if you will then trust simply trust in that change I have decided to change therefore it is all changed I will trust in that change by again looking for the differences rather than the similarities and then the third step is to simply act as though you trust that it has changed those three simple steps allow you to transform the face of your reality 100% if that's your assignment of meaning can again seem like a slight change within the huge totality that you are if that is your choice of assignment of meaning both are true both are valid however the willingness to assign the more positive meaning allows you to get more of a consciously useful shall we say result out of the situation and then allows situations to transform for understand all situations in your life are a reflection for your life is an extension of your consciousness so anything within it is perhaps you can say a message that you are wishing to explore so your willingness to look at a given situation with the purpose of deriving that message allows the situation to be of service to you when you do so derive the service and then act or do whatever you can to express what you have gotten out of it then the situation transform there is no longer the need for the symbol delivering the message to hang around however if you in that sense choose to deny the message that you create a symbol to deliver that message still exists within you so in general you will create similar seeming circumstance that will again bring it to your attention and very often this will come in the form of what you seem to create as a negative pattern or a repetitive negative occurrence in your life if this is occurring you may understand that as all other creations you have created it but are not deriving service from it your willingness to simply give it a negative label and tuck it back into the closet still means that it is unresolved within you therefore allowing the symbols to deliver the meaning that you created them for allows them to have fulfilled their purpose and then you no longer will create in the creative way that you do choose your reality these types of symbols to seemingly keep coming around to show you that idea therefore your willingness to derive service your willingness to derive meaning from anything that exists in your life allows you to use all your creations in a positive way and thereby as you act like a creator once again you begin to get that evidence that feedback from your reality for you have assigned the meaning that I am the creator of my reality therefore when you act that way as all other situations that you act on you get the results which seem to come in the form of the evidence that yes you do create your own life this is the exact same mechanism you are now using when you believe you don't create your own life for you then act a particular way get a particular result and then say see there's the evidence obviously I don't create my own reality the point is that you are experts at doing this therefore it does not take too much to simply move that point of view toward the conscious this virus positive intention for that intention aligns you with your ability to act in a positive way which then again midwife these concepts into the physical reality you call your life it is again ultimately your actions which shall we say are the ultimate result in factor but never do you perform any actions in a vacuum you always have when performing actions the assignment of meaning behind them therefore if you wish to begin to again create your life consciously according to preference be mindful of the fact that when you get a particular impression from a situation that you are assigning that impression this then put it back into your grasp gives you back your power to decide if that is truly the assignment you wish to make to that situation for you will often find now that the assignments were quote unquote automatic but now that you know even that it's a notion that the assignment occurs and then gives you the effect you can always now pause before acting pause before you do anything and if you in that sense align yourself with the positive service and then act regardless of the fact that you have viewed the negative that you have evaluated the negative because you are only willing to act or do something when the positive perspective is in place you only get the positive effect now again we have said perhaps a few times that as your awareness expands as your consciousness expands you become more aware of anything that is within any reality that you create and this particular reality contains polarity polarity is negative and positive so again by extension as you expand your awareness of both will expand but what need not expand is your experience of both for again what determines your experience are your actions with the assignment of meaning therefore if you only assign positive meaning across the board you can only get positive effects your awareness your increased awareness of negativity as well as your increased awareness of positivity but your increased awareness of negativity will come in the form of negativity as experienced by others therefore understand the distinction in being aware of an idea and what causes you to then experience the idea from your centered self you can very safely view all the positive and all the negative for none of it again has any effect till you act but if you remain grounded enough to only act when having provided a positive alternative again the increasing awareness of negativity will be through others so you will still be aware of it you will not be in a vacuum you will still be in the reality that you have chosen to create and experience the polarity you have chosen to experience in the form of awareness as you begin to choose positive meaning and correspondingly perform positive actions the results of your actions are not only as a fruition in your life but also then our scene can be seen by others therefore in the totality of your reality there is more access and more of an option for others to see that the positive perspective does work and it is the seeing that what you are doing yields the results that is the strongest example not discussing what sounds nice but by embodying those ideas the more you are willing to do this the more you will attract other individuals also very excited about that idea and you will begin to see very quickly changes across the board global changes one other notion that you sometimes hold is that if I change myself it really makes a very little to no change in the world around me this is the assignment of a meaning or definition understand that again when you make a change it all changes perhaps if you wish you can use the following analogy if you were to view yourself as a gear enmeshed with many other gears all representing perhaps the other billions of individuals upon your plan you may understand that if you as the gear turns obviously though perhaps not greatly but at least a bit all the gears will turn and this is literally true of the results of your actions in this life it affects everything across the board now again this is a matter of perspective if you choose to say that I changing or a change in myself will result in very little change in the world around me and then you come from that perspective and act from that perspective you may provide the evidence at first that you are the only one changing but if you understand that a change in you is a change in the universe that you create in it is a change in everything you will then be looking again for the differences for the changes and then you will have the eyes to see those changes and by being very shall we say astute and aware to those changes you will allow yourself to attract the other individuals that will in a sense assist and be aware of them as you attract them so be mindful of where you assign your meaning be mindful of your definition be mindful before you act as to what your foundational assignment of meaning is for that will always either subtly or blatantly affect your actions and even the subtle affectation of your actions can give the subtle result that you perhaps will not prefer or again if it is a positive assignment the subtle result that you will prefer it is truly up to you and it always will be in that sense up to you to assign the meaning carry the intention within you and perform the actions which then literally create the reality this is how you have already created your life what we are suggesting is now becoming conscious about it if you wish to change it if you do not simply go about your business and everything will automatically fall into place but what we again are discussing is conscious creation according to preference simply because you desire to do so and you know that acting upon your own passion or excitement with integrity can only be of positive service to yourself and to those around you allow me now to thank you all for your willingness to interact with me and the members of my civilization and the respective civilizations on this end we understand that even when interacting with us that you each will assign your own meaning as to what we represent to you therefore it is never our intention to insist that we are who we say we are it simply is unimportant to us that you believe that we are who we say we are for that then places the weight upon the message that we are delivering rather than the messenger and at least up till now in your society there has been a pension to latch on to the messenger very many times at the cost of the message itself therefore what we desire is what we are sharing in terms of the empowerment of the self for that is what allows us to have a telepathic society that is what allows us to function as a unit without shall we say the expense or at the cost of individuality we still maintain our individuality but in that sense still get things done in a positive way and we understand that this is attracted to the members of your society therefore by allowing the message to be what's important and who's delivering it to perhaps be a footnote this allows you to decide for yourself and regardless if you choose to believe this or not service will be derived by you either you will get something from what I am saying or you will define yourself in deciding that it does not apply to you and automatically attract yourself into whatever circumstance will then be of service to you more shall we say consciously or directly so from our perspective we simply cannot lose and wish in that sense to revel in the exchange with you for we get shall we say quite a bit out of this as well it allows us to see that many more ways that all that is or what you call God expresses itself throughout the multiverse this is one of our interests and fascination and you in that sense being sparks of the infinite itself are quite fascinating to us though you may perceive that our focus is a bit more expanded than your own this simply means that our chosen point of view is less focused or limited what this does not mean is that in any way shape or form we are better than you know in general there will be the assignment of meaning from members of your society that extraterrestrial races are better than you know and perhaps that very idea is one of the things that prevents us from interacting with you face to face on map right now it is not our intention in interacting with you to have you give your power away to us as you pick up the ball as you say and run with it with many of the concepts that we share by extension you become self-empower by extension you begin to exercise your ability to respond your response ability in your reality thereby making you living examples of the way that we live and thereby putting you over mind to take back the assignment of meaning to your own power and then in that sense when you truly feel this way about yourself and we should that be the case land and interact with you it will simply be a reunion not all right individuals coming down to save you that is not the point you are not drowning you are not perceived as drowning and we understand and respect your choice of exploration you are allowed in that sense to read the benefits of any exploration that you so choose to partake of reaping the benefits though you do not generally look at it this way comes in the form of the negative choices as well for if you make positive choices you read the benefits of those choices if you make negative choices you then read the benefits of those choices as well though perhaps you have not looked at them as benefits but nevertheless they are the response and result of choices that you make therefore you get the free will to explore that as a society you are now beginning to make shall we say collectively speaking more positive choices and this can be perceived by shall we say the many societies that are observing your society in a blatant way therefore as this begins to occur the day does in that sense grow closer whereby we can have more blatant open interactions it is not likely that our civilization will be the first but there are shall we say one or two other civilizations in place that are more likely to be the first civilization that you begin to find out about again on that and you may pay particular attention to what you call your media for the next shall we say eleven months or so for you will buy your October 1993 year find shall we say some irrefutable evidence of the existence of extraterrestrial civilization and understand that this evidence has existed for many many years upon your planet but now is most likely the timing to begin to disseminate that and allow you to make your own choices allow you to assign your own meaning therefore in return for this willingness of your consciousness to begin to expand and explore the many possibilities available to you in this life I thank you I express my unconditional love and ask you how I may be of service to you sharing I would like to share a couple of observations and feelings oh please take up so that all may share the gifts that you are from our world-fiction regarding the whole matter of loneliness and feeling empty inside the concept of search for special birth and to share one's life and all that many many people go through this pain on the other hand I know the love life of a franite experience differently from your perspective not leading anyone or might be interpretable kind of self love I think because of that reason I'm almost afraid that you won't be able to relate to what I'm talking about I understand what you are thinking about for when I interact with a human channel I have access to many of these ideas that may not be shall we say common on a daily basis in our reality do proceed. That brings me to the first part of my question being what you are at the level of your understanding do you can you feel our pain in motion I'm not talking about remembering it because you have gone through it in your past and asking you if you have lost the ability by being from the ability no we do not choose in that sense to create belief which seem in that sense to limit up any longer and it is in general the belief that you create that result in limitation that then have the corresponding emotions that you generally will label limiting or negative understand again that our orientation differs from yours in the affect that we already each consider ourselves as individuals complete and whole yes in the sense you may say that that is a direct result of unconditional self love but because that is the meaning that we assign within ourselves anything that we attract in our reality is a reflection of that meaning therefore when we interact with other individuals there is the opportunity to share there is the opportunity to have a common experience but it is truly an equal sharing perhaps as you sometimes will say on your planet rather than it being a 50% 50% relationship it is a 100% 100% relationship the whole of which is perhaps you can say more than the sum total of the parts but because we already feel complete within ourselves our relationships can only reflect back to ourselves our inner completeness and the inner completeness of all those around us now adversely in your society and you are not by any means the only society that chooses to create this you are not always taught that you are already 100% complete therefore perhaps you operate from an assumption that you are incomplete many times how you will become complete will be shall we say extended to your external reality well if I only had this thing I would be complete if I only had this situation I would be complete if I only had this amount of money I would be complete oh if this person would only come along they would complete me but understand the paradox you have come from a perspective when saying that of assigning the meaning that you are already incomplete so as you attract each one of these symbols that you think will make you complete they can only reflect back to you what you already truly believe which is that you are incomplete so as you attract things from that premise even though they are the things you feel would make you complete they can only reflect back to you what you truly believe that you are already incomplete and needless to say when applying this to your relationship it is most obvious that this takes the form of attracting an individual who really makes you feel incomplete or who seems so incomplete themselves that compared to them you're in good shape but understand in either instance you have created a reflection of your incomplete feeling and that is a choice that is an assignment in and of itself you have a sign perhaps with a little bit of help a little bit of encouragement from those in your society but you have a sign that you are incomplete therefore your willingness to entertain perhaps you can say the notion that you are already complete allows you to begin to demonstrate to yourself unconditional self love unconditional self love this means no matter what you do no matter what there are no conditions to your love for yourself now this is not shall we say presented to give you license to do things out of integrity and then simply forgive yourself but the point is even if you were to do something out of integrity if you are willing to look at how that served you which will generally come in the form of I really never wish to do that again and use the service that that situation has been to you then it will shall we say allow you to complete part of the equation within you and express it in that way your willingness to simply cut yourself some slack and allow yourself to love yourself no matter what then results in that feeling that you are loved and very often many of the actions that you perform that you consider negative come from the assignment of meaning that you are not loved understand again the paradox is that all that is or what you call God can only unconditionally love you this means there has never been a moment in your life that you were not unconditionally loved by God well many of you may say then what was all that judgment I felt that was you that was your own set of standards that was your own conditional love now that you know that you can tap into the feeling of that constant unconditional love of all that is as I have said it is ceaseless and constant you cannot lose it you cannot break it there is no judgment from an unconditionally loving perspective when you allow yourself to feel this to whatever degree you are willing you then have a model or a template so that you can match it and when you begin to love yourself you begin to feel love then you act from your completeness then you act from your whole you no longer feel lonely you feel ecstatic and when you in that sense attract individuals they interact with that reflection they reflect back to you your feelings of completeness when you change because when one gear turns they all turn everybody else seems to change as well for now that you assume the new perspective and settle for nothing less you look for different things in others you interact with others on a different level and you allow them to match that vibration within you so if you truly wish for the scenario that you have shared with me to change simply change yourself simply look at when you are not loving yourself and use that as a service to remind yourself to re-enfill that love do you understand here is that a service and we thank you sure as will you be I want to ask about the lights I don't mean the purpose of life we've covered out a number of times I don't mean the life that's been fine to just this planet I mean life and can you give me a definition is it our is it the same as our consciousness our spirit is that the same definition in a sense you may understand that one of the shall we say common assets of all consciousness and existence is that and again perhaps this is a bit simplified but it will do it simply is it simply exists I am as you sometimes say is a state of being there for life exists simply because it does because it's an option because it is one of the explorations available because it is something that can be imagined so therefore simply because is usually an answer that does not sit well but in this instance it would apply most strongly. Scientists and medical pioneers have come up with the brilliant conclusion that if you're breathing you've got it if you're dead you don't die. Got what? Well understand again perhaps that is a definition or description of a particular expression of consciousness but what you call mineral kingdom your rock kingdom is a very dense form of consciousness itself so perhaps by their definition it would not be considered life or organic but from the overall perspective it is a form of consciousness one thing that your scientists are beginning to discover most concretely is that matter and energy are different aspects of the same expression what is not entirely understood is that in general energy is an expression of consciousness therefore again perhaps it is not considered that a rock is or has life but obviously a rock exists and can be experienced within your life so then it is again a matter of definitions and descriptive ideas. Well our scientists claim that neither energy nor matter although they can change from one to the other can ever be destroyed likewise life can never be destroyed. Well again it depends upon your definition if you mean in the sense that you have shared when something which is alive is now dead then perhaps it is considered to no longer have life but if it is existing within someone else's life that can in that sense perceive it then perhaps on another level you may understand that it is part of life itself. Again this is arbitrary and perhaps an exercise in semantics. Let me ask about plants and animals we say they have life. Is that life eternal? Well perhaps again in the life span aspect that you mean not the vessel or body but the overall consciousness yes the consciousness that you in that sense proceed to be your own is eternal the all consciousness is eternal. I always get hung up on the over soul and how that somehow is separate from our consciousness here. In what way? It seems like it is two different items. That is because you are assigning a separate me but you are the over soul. You are perhaps perceiving yourself as an extension of the over soul but you are the over soul itself in physical terms. Okay I hear what you are saying I know I don't fully comprehend it but that is enough for me to handle tonight. Thank you very much. If in that sense you wish to settle for that that is quite fine but if you wish to expand upon it by shall we say verbalizing perhaps we can go a bit further. You always talk about the over soul as being different or separate apart from the time. How do you look at it this way? What you perceive to be your body consciousness is a point of view of your over soul. From the point of view from perhaps you can say the body point of view. From the perspective and point of view of the over soul the body point of view exists within it as one of its many manifestations. One of its many presentations or factors. So again it is a matter of point of view. You may understand that though your bodily point of view may seem to exclude many of the points of view of your over soul. You need not interpret that as a separation. You may if you wish to sign the meaning that you are seeing through a particular perspective of your over soul that has a particular reason and a particular function. If you will assume it from that point of view as an expression of point of view through your physical body from your over soul perhaps you can get a different feeling from it. Once we die here will I then become feel like I am totally aware of my over soul. You will perhaps expand to include this one point of view as a reference but not as the only point of view. So again perhaps from that perspective you would seem to have more of the overseeing or oversight of the over soul. That is helpful thank you very much. Thank you. Shut it. Hey I have a question for a dear friend of mine. Oh right. But proxy. She has some severe physical problems that limit her ability to move and to live a joyful life. She has fibrocytus and rheumatoid arthritis and carpal tunnel syndrome. Now what doctors have told her to do to help the fibrocytus does not help the rheumatoid arthritis and the remedies for the rheumatoid arthritis do not help the fibrocytus. And she does not understand. She doesn't totally believe that she creates her reality but even if she is willing to accept that she cannot understand why she has created this. Oh and perhaps the first thing that you can do to be of assistance to her is to recognize that for the time being she may put aside what the condition that she has created prevents her from doing. And once that is aside looking at what it actually has forced her to look at, has forced her to see within herself. She is willing to be more responsible about getting, greening those messages. First of all understand that some messages will be blatantly obvious. Approaching it from the perspective all right I know how this limits me but what about it serves me. What does it force me to look at will allow her to shall we say receive a particular message from the symbol. However having already created that symbol she still can do the following. From what is available to her in any given moment and I understand that because of what she has created perhaps there is less available to her than there would have been. She is willing to factor out the things that would have been and only see what is there, what she can do and then choose from those options the one that truly excites her the most, the one that truly moves her the most and acts upon that to whatever degree she is able. She will then begin to establish a new momentum. She will get the results of whatever degree she is willing to do that from what is available. Not concentrating on fixating on what is not available which simply reaffirms what is not available. Recreates her to embody what is not available. Do you understand the distinction? Yes. Also perhaps more physical point of view, one moment. The ingestion of large amounts of water, clear water would be beneficial. Are you aware of she is doing this? I don't know. Interesting. It is not usually our particular perspective to shall we say receive and perceive specifics but it is also highly shall we say advisable if it applies to her that she in that sense for the time being discontinue the consumption of what you call chocolate. Does this make sense to you? I don't know if she eats much chocolate. Our suggestion would be to share what we have already shared with her. Are there additional questions about this? At the moment now thank you. We thank you very much in that sense for being willing to share your gift with her. What would you say, what is the purpose of these existence of man and how would you define God within that content? Well first of all our particular shall we say label for God is all that is and the reason we choose to use that label is shall we say it is a bit precise in that it describes that there is simply nothing that you can perceive or imagine or that exists that is not within and part of all that is. Therefore all that is is simultaneously everything and at the same time can shall we say express itself as seeming to be a single consciousness much as yourself. All that is or God is an infinite idea that within it contains finite manifestation. Mankind or man and woman kind or human kind is such an expression of finiteness within the infinity. Infinity has no boundaries, no beginning, no ending, no space, no time. One of the aspects that is created that exists within that infinity is the finite multiverse which you exist within. All that is is perhaps you can see the ultimate exploration of consciousness. Humankind is a particular expression or exploration of consciousness that in a sense chooses to create certain boundaries, certain limitations, certain point of view or focus that allows you to explore in a very pinpoint fashion. Or when you in that sense become human you again being pure consciousness impose a type of amnesia on your soul's knowingness so that you can in that sense perceive yourself as having a beginning, middle and ending. But perhaps you can say the primary reason for doing so is for discovery itself. All that is or God is all knowing and all seeing and you are an aspect as a soul of all that is therefore you are also as a soul or over soul or higher self all knowing all seeing. One idea that you cannot explore when you know it all is discovery, is learning, is surprise for if you already know it all nothing is new, nothing can be discovered while I already knew that. Therefore you may understand that one of the primary reasons for the type of exploration of consciousness that you call humankind physical reality is to be able to have your consciousness be so focused with such tunnel vision perhaps you can say that you can actually discover things as if they are anew. You can actually learn things and experience things for the first time and that is something that again where you are all knowing is not available. So perhaps the shortest answer to your question is that the reason for the existence of humankind is for the joy of discovery is for the joy of unfolding who you are a bit at a time rather than experiencing yourself only all at once. It is an alternative point of view and alternative exploration. Does this make sense? Is there something else that you see? No, I just trying to determine the essence of life. You become whole and you become more total to what? Well the idea is perhaps you can say the purpose for this life is to live this life to the fullest. It is to in that sense create from this life in a positive way, derive from this life the things that bring you joy and express that joy in this life which then as shall we say an exponential effect to spread out amongst the others on your planet. Your particular purpose is contained within you in the form of a vibration you call your excitement. For excitement is the vibratory energy that tells you in any given situation that the thing you are excited about is most representative of who you chose to be is most representative of your purpose. And if you act upon the things that truly excite you with integrity and integrity is the full knowledge that everything is all one thing you are a part of that thing and therefore treat everything within that experience with the respect of it being an extension of yourself. If you act on your excitement with integrity you then get results that again bring you joy that again bring you knowledge that again bring you expansion that again are of service to you and therefore of service to other individuals. Does this help? Is there something specific you are seeking? No. Then we ask that as this interaction unfolds that you keep your ears open for others may ask questions that will in a sense have pertinent answers to you. And if again there is something that is unclear about what I have said or if what I have said opens up a whole new set of questions please feel free to share again. All right. I will take that idea. Shit. Come on. Oh hello Alan. Greetings. My Women's Spiritual Psychotherapy Group is going very well. Oh. And it inspired me to want to give a workshop here on opening your channel. Well how exciting. I assume that there are several individuals present who will be seeking to you at the break. I have assisted a number of people in my practice to do this. And as I was talking with a psychic person she was disagreeing with offering this to the public from the point of view that people that are in my practice I know but for people who are just coming for a workshop could access some form of negative experiences. This has never been my experience with the people that I have attracted. And I would like to ask you to interrupt what you really and understand that her belief is an expression and statement of where she is at. Is there really such a thing because my belief system doesn't contain that. Really such a thing as what? Such a thing as attracting negative spirits to me that will be. Well again you understand. You attract the reality that you are the vibration of. If your vibration and your intention is of unconditional love, light, givingness then that is what you attract. If what you in a sense put out is fear. And fear is an emotional statement that perhaps corresponds to the idea that something that you do not prefer is most likely. Then you can attract a corresponding version of what you don't prefer. That is one reason that we suggest clarity when in that sense you are exploring these types of ideas. However if one feels fear that in and of itself is not negative, it is neutral. And a person's willingness to understand that fear is again a statement that I believe something I do not prefer is most likely. You can use that fear. You cannot get rid of the fear. For again you are the totality. You are the reality. There is no outside and there is nowhere to get rid of anything too. Your willingness in that sense to use the fear by asking yourself, all right, I feel this fear. Let me feel it and make sure it is really fear. It is fear. All right. What must I believe right here, right now, where I am sitting, what is happening to be feeling this fear? Well, perhaps I can believe that something can come in and get me. All right. Yes, I do believe that. Now you have the belief. And only when you first own the belief can you change that belief. And your willingness to in that sense remind yourself that nothing can slip in there without your permission can set up the vibration of the new belief. Do you understand? Yes. Or if you have a negative intention, you can attract a corresponding negative vibration for again, this is a universe of polarity. But if you have a positive unconditionally loving intention, negativity cannot find that. Negativity cannot see that. They do not, perhaps you can say, experientially exist within the same reality. Therefore, perhaps a suggestion would be prior to the implementing of a process. Would be the identification of the intention. And shall we say the utilization of what one already does feel to nail down what they believe, if that belief is suitable and useful by all means, keep it. If not, you can then look at the actions that would correspond to the new preferred belief. Is that a difference? Yes, because I have a question about this a little bit. I guess I don't believe in negative entities. I believe in you. They believe in you. Who believes in me? The idea is once again that you can grant validity to them, but have them simply be irrelevant. In other words, negative energy does exist for it is an option. So to deny its existence in a sense places attention upon it. To acknowledge that it all exists, but you will only attract what is relevant to you, makes that negative perspective irrelevant. Not that it doesn't exist, not that you are invalidating it, but that it is simply irrelevant to who you are. Perhaps you have a belief that should you allow yourself to believe that it even exists, that it could overwhelm you. But it cannot. Allow for its existence, but again allow it to be irrelevant to who you are. In other words, validate it and send it on a scary way. If I have that belief, which I'm not in touch with consciously- Well, you are in touch with it. That's why we are having this discussion. Then how could I have been channeling for all these years, eleven, twelve years, and I've only had positive experiences with the channeling? Perhaps you are not understanding what I am saying. You are coming from a positive perspective. Therefore you can only experience a positive experience. You can only, in answering an arrangement to, as you say, channel, bring forth an energy that is corresponding to your own orientation, which is unconditionally loving. That is why you have gotten the results that you have done. It is not that the negative again does not exist, it is simply irrelevant to you and therefore does not exist within your experience. Is that clear? Thank you. We are in that sense simply maintaining our assertion to you that all truths are true. The ultimate truth is that all truths are true, and the good news is you get to pick the ones you want. But not by invalidating the ones you don't. Not by judging the ones you don't. That puts more attention upon the ones you don't. By acknowledging everything and simply choosing what you wish because it is who you choose to be. That is what gives you the simplest and easiest access to the things you desire. By invalidating the thing you don't desire, you paradoxically hold that in place. Is that clear? Is there something else that is coming up? Yeah, well, I can't show you reading my mind. Not really, I don't read, but I understand what you mean. I'm thinking of those people I've heard who said that as they tried to channel or even if they had these experiences that were upsetting to them or negative, I've always taken it to mean that it was a part of their own unconscious. Well, in a sense, but you may understand they have the fear. They made the statement that they truly believe it was perhaps more likely that a negative entity would interact with them. And what they, in a sense, experience may have been a subconscious portion of themselves. May have been a reflection of attraction of a negative energy, but was only allowed by them due to their lack of knowledge of what we are discussing. What is the negative energy or entity? Well, perhaps just in general terms, positive would be defined by things which are integrative, which bring things back together, which in that sense represent everything being an expression of one thing. Negative would be something which is separate, exclusionary in that sense. Are you talking about disembodied spirits or energy? Not necessarily. Again, perhaps in the aforementioned example, it would have loosely corresponded to the subconscious of that individual, attracted or called forth from the fear itself. I think I understand it. Oh, if not, we will speak again. Shut it. I don't know which side I should give you here is the one. She was one. OK. Actually, I'm going to read you a poem for now. Oh, thank you. And I'll wait for the next hour for the other hand. And I was listening to a tape of music that sky was a sight of beauty. The colors were harsh in the sky with clouds, seen by high. I felt the universe punching my heart, punching my very soul. I felt attached to the universal power. My whole body was feeling tired as the music played on. I was traveling in my shift in my car. Now, in space, not very far. My trip was eternity I've never forgotten. I felt around the love. And the sky on high shooting down like a invisible hand of love. The time is near what all we hear and see what love can be. A world that glows and flows in a beam of light. The time is near and not the fear. The endless power we all have had fear. For the people of Earth, as the people from afar, meet each other as one under our central sun. That's it. We thank you for your expression from the heart. Thank you. At this time, we will pause for a short break of 10 to 15 minutes of your counting and resume contact at that time.
