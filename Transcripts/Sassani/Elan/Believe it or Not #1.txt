 All right, I'll say greetings this evening, our audio. Oh, thank you very much. Allow me to begin this interaction with the entitlement. Believe it or not. Before I proceed, allow me to once again remind you all that we never do insist that you do believe within these interactions that we are who we say we are because we say it. We cannot prove it at this time. However, the principle, the mechanics, the physics, the ideas that we share with you can prove themselves, but only in action. They sound very nice to the ears, but the action, the doing, the willingness to incorporate them as an action within your life is the only way that I can guarantee the result. So therefore, the guarantee isn't full swing, but not simply because we are saying it, but because you are willing, if it works for you, to use it. For again, anything we have to say is not better, even if it works for you than anything else from our perspective, but we offer it allowing you to choose freely, to utilize it at any time. And are thereby then willing to expand and discuss these ideas as you try them on, so to speak. Allow us to then proceed with the main topic, if you will, for the evening. That being, perhaps you can say, a slightly more in depth discussion about what you label belief. It's to me. Understand, we have again discussed many times that you are all creations. You are all sparks of the infinite creation itself, what you call God, what we call all that is. And all that is, is in and of itself a frequency, a wavelength, if you will, the primary frequency in the case of all that is. You are also frequency. Perhaps you can say distortions, or shall we say, interpretations or filtered frequencies of the primary frequency. This is what creates you, in a sense, into physical beings. The rate at which you vibrate, that is one of the ideas that it creates your life around you. But also, understand, that we have discussed many times that your personality is composed of belief, emotions and mentality. And this is what allows you to function and create your life in a particular way. Allow us this evening to elucidate a bit more clearly, a bit more precisely on the belief system leg of that prism. For understanding that within the vibration, the frequency of all that is, and within the vibration of the signature vibration that you are, are your belief system. And these two are vibratory frequencies, vibratory frequencies, in this case of awareness. But when you utilize those particular frequencies, there are always corresponding results depending on which frequency you choose. So therefore, perhaps you can say your primary belief in life is the primary frequency through which you are choosing to explore at this time. As we have also discussed, vibration attracts like vibration. So therefore, when you have an overall primary belief, it attracts, so to speak, around it many other peripheral beliefs that are also of similar vibration, though slightly out of phase with the primary belief vibration. What this does, the effect of it, these beliefs which aggregate around the primary belief, is to literally lay down a background, a background over which the primary release can then stand out in release. In a sense, you can understand that the background reinforces the primary belief and allows it again by comparison to stand out. Now, chronologically speaking, because you are in a world of timing, you can say, for the purposes particularly of this discussion, that the primary belief vibration comes first, and that the aggregate belief, so to speak, lag behind. Or another way that we have sometimes shared this idea is that the primary belief is the originating sound, whereas the aggregate belief that allow it to stand out in release are the echoes. Now, understand, when you change, truly change your primary belief, everything changes. As you say across the board, everything changes. Sometimes at first, because of the way you create the idea of transforming a bit at a time, there will be a similarity in the new background as the old, some things that allow you to have it seem to be continuous. But it is truly speaking, so to speak, a different background altogether. We have also used this analogy. You have a cube that has painted many different colors on each side of the cube, if you will. There are two ways to look at changing the side or one side of the cube, painting it perhaps a different color. One way to look at it is that it's the same old cube with a slight facelift. One other way, however, to look at it is that it is now an entirely different cube by definition. So therefore, by extension, you can choose to look at the background in that same way, either same background with a slight little change or understand that the whole background, the whole echo, has changed. Now, we delineate this for the following reasons. Refined in your society, individuals will begin to initiate a change within themselves, begin to take certain steps toward modifying their primary belief, frequently. But very often will, as you say in your language, trip themselves up and perhaps seem to cancel the effect of the change. And this occurs due to the following reasons. When you change your primary belief and the accompanying background belief, thereby extension changes, if you understand that everything has changed, then you are no longer willing to look at the feedback that you get according to the old background, according to the echo itself. If, in a sense, you change your primary belief, but will only derive validation of change from the background, which, again, lags behind, is an echo, you then cancel out the change for you do not validate the change in the primary belief. You validate the seeming, shall we say, consistency of the background. What this translates out to is as follows. You can simply understand, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that when you change that primary belief, the background has entirely transformed. Again, it may present similar faces, similar styles of presentation at first. But it is your willingness to look for the differences in the background that have you use the change in the primary frequency as your criteria, rather than an old seeming background. Is this translating? All right. Therefore, when you institute change in your primary belief and something seems to come up, which seem on the surface to negate that change? Understand that that is simply an interpretation using the old background. And if you feel in your heart and heart that you have instituted a change, and then see what seems to be an old effect, if you label it, here comes the old effect, you get that result. If you refuse to label it, here comes the old effect, because you know that the old effect was an echo of the old belief, you can then give yourself the opportunity to look at the changes rather than the consistency and thereby validate the background or the echo changing as well. When you validate with the echo of the old belief, you re-center yourself to the old primary belief. When you refuse to do that, you midwife the new belief firmly into your reality. Now again, this takes most subtly the form of an action. For when you believe something, you always by extension act as if you believe it. So therefore, that is what creates the result in your life, physically being that you are physical beings, exploring a physical world. So when you would seem to have made a change and see similar things happening, the action that is reflective of the change is not being willing to use the old background. Your willingness to even look at what some of the other ideas are and look at why it is different rather than the same is the action that in a sense demonstrates to the universe that you truly believe the new belief. So therefore, it is a matter of attitude. It is a matter of point of view, of perspective, and of a willingness to not settle for anything less than the beliefs you now wish to have. It is very simple to change beliefs, and we have discussed this many times, but only can you ever do so by first acknowledging the old unpreferred belief as the belief that has served you up till now, validating that it has served you, even if the only reason that it serves you is to tell you you could use the new belief right now. So therefore, you can always find some service from it. And your willingness to simply refuse to allow evidence to provide you thinking that you did not change allows the change. For change is not something you can force or make. It is something that is automatic. It is the constant in creation. Change in a sense is one of the only constants. So therefore, allowing that constant is quite simple, quite effortless. Forcing something to change in that sense is a paradox. You cannot force something to change. And all the forcing may only make it seem to stay the same. So the attitude of allowance is an open, releasing, allowing attitude, a very light attitude. And that can be quite helpful in allowing you to let go of the things you do not prefer. Again, understand, ding that you cannot get rid of it, but simply transform its relevance to you. Now, this is what occurs when you assume a belief system. You assume the primary belief. The background congregates around that belief. And then they form, in a sense, a type of glasses that you wear, in a sense, whereby you can now only see through that frequency. Therefore, you will only allow yourself to see things that are consistent with those beliefs. And when you change the beliefs, in a sense, by analogy, you change the prescription of those glasses. And therefore, perhaps you will need to squint a little bit at first to find the things you prefer within the new belief. But since they are new glasses, you will acclimate to them. And it is a matter of that. Now, again, you do not get rid of old beliefs. It is a matter of relativity, so to speak. All beliefs are within you. However, when you choose to manifest, when you choose to embody a particular belief, it is then followed by the new background. And the new background, one moment, will contain within it different relevance of the old ideas. When you choose one particular belief, the old belief is simply not relevant to the new belief. It is still within you. It is still and always will be a choice. And this is your personal power, your ability to always have the choice. But what changes is the relative significance of the old belief. And we share that to, again, reinforce the idea that getting rid of something assumes there's somewhere to put it. And being that you are the universe, there is no outside. There is no place to put it. Anywhere you quote unquote put it, will be within you. So it is not a matter of getting rid of it. Simply shifting its relevance to its relativity to what you are exploring. And the glasses of the new belief simply, in a sense, filter out the relativity of the old belief. Is that clear? Oh, why? You do not sound so sure. Perhaps we will entertain a few questions. If there is, shall we say, some lack of clarity. Allow me to, therefore, thank you all. For these interactions, allow us in many ways to disseminate great deals of information and, at the same time, gather information from your society. Believe it or not, we love these interactions. And we love you all unconditionally. Therefore, I ask you now, how may I be of service to you? Shiree, over there. When you are in the middle of a sentence, and you stop cold, and then you appear to be thinking, or it's almost like a computer clicking and trying to find the data bank. What are you doing? And because you come in with the next word that is absolutely appropriate, what is that time life all about? Now, I understand this will vary. It can simply be that there is a shift in the mode of thinking. For from our end, though I present myself as a singular individual, there are actually many individuals on this end, as there are on yours. They participate in these interactions peripherally. But from time to time, if it is a particular expertise of a particular being or entity, then there may be a lag in that particular perspective filtering through. In this particular instance, this was, shall we say, an exception, for there was some communication that was, shall we say, not exactly, entirely, directly related to this interaction from my end. In other words, I was having a side conversation. But understand, there is also the accessing of what you may label to be the self-aware computer, what you sometimes label the Akashic record, what you will sometimes label the higher self of the individual we are interacting with. So there are many reasons why we will say that. And please feel free to ask any time. Is that all? And thank you. Shut it. Hey. When we allow an experience to transform, as far as we experience anger and we allow that to transform, what we're really doing is selecting another viewpoint and having a different experience, because we're filtering that perception to another belief. Is that not so? Well, in a sense, more shall we say, technically speaking, in that instance, you are allowing the emotion to serve you and then not going to the extent of going into, as you say, judgment and invalidation for the thing you do not prefer. So it is simply a matter of using that, rather than, shall we say, feeling at the mercy of it. But more specifically, it's not a question of transforming the anger of so much as it is a matter of shifting the viewpoint. Is that not so? Yeah. It is using all your creations. Not being, in that sense, willing to think that anything is extraneous. It is the sense that something does not belong. How can that be there? The nerve of that thing that gives you that feeling. But if you understand it is part, then the action that reflects that belief is engaging yourself actively into how to use it in a positive service to integrate yourself to expand your consciousness. So it is an overall attitude more than just one particular slight point of view. So in essence, when we ask ourselves in this situation, what must I believe right now to be experiencing this, and then take a look at that belief and own it, we are simply choosing another belief. We're not getting rid of that belief. We still contain that belief. You are acknowledging that you have already chosen that belief, perhaps unconsciously, perhaps bought into it because of your society's notion. But then, in that sense, understanding that you have created it and acknowledging it, owning it, now saying, all right, it has served me. Obviously, I chose it. Whether I chose it consciously or unconsciously, I allow everything to be of service to me. This is what I would now rather believe. And it is now equalizing both notions, the old belief and the new. Very often when individuals move on to the new belief, they invalidate the old belief. They dislike individuals who have the old belief. They get very nasty to individuals with that old belief because they have outgrown it. But in a sense, that is not integration. That is denial. And one still contains the old belief. They're merely choosing a new belief. But if you choose the new belief and act according to it, the effect of the old belief, the relevance of the old belief is being made. And it is no longer relevant to the new belief. So it has served you. And in a sense, you have allowed it to be honest, Mary White. And it's influenced fades simply because you're not putting attention on it. And it is the attention you put upon it that has kept it firmly in place up till then. Which is the very reason why invalidating a choice you do not prefer gives it strength. It plays its attention upon it. Yeah. Now, my question to follow up, when you had how was the month? How was this month? Actually Andrew asked how was this month. We assume it was perfect whether or not you interpreted that way. It was a perfect month. However, I find it more. Oh, but? It was a perfect month and? By the way, perfect has no buts. But do proceed. I think there's a perfect buts, however. Oh. On our planet thing all along. This is also true of your planet. You are less willing to acknowledge it. No. Or let's say you were appreciating any given buts given what you want. And should I always say, you have a lot of conditions, ifs, ands, and buts. Let me move my butt in the middle range and hold on. And say it was a perfect month and I'm noticing that the more intense the situations are that come up in the course of a month, the more powerful the lessons are and the more powerful I feel when I emerge from the lessons to the point where actually when things come up, I get excited because I know I'm dealing with something that's really going to have a big payoff. Oh. And I get excited. Now my question is, I find that I'm not alone in this. If I start dialing up my friends, I find that they also are going through an intense period when I am, it's relatively on the same subjects and they're making similar accommodations. They may be able to contribute something to my experience. I may be able to contribute something to theirs. Now we want to understand this is what we were saying about life vibration. Now I'm making a request or asking for your consideration. Either that you might be willing to comment on what has happened in the past month. What could we do a synoptic review for ourselves in our own head? What type of issues have come up? What type of lessons have come down? What types of things have been taught? Or take a look at what's going to come up and or take a look at what's going to come up in the next month between now and the next time we meet. Well, we would not want to open your presence for you. But as a review of the aforementioned month, again, understand, you are no longer in that sense about to enter a transformation. You are well within it. And one of the symptoms, if you wish to call it a symptom, of it is extreme acceleration. So the past month of your time has been no exception. There is a momentum and acceleration in full swing. One of the primary issues, shall we say societally speaking, there are many. But one of the primary ones is racial and shall we say class integration. These are some of the shall we say issues that you have been looking at, somewhat in tandem, somewhat altogether. Many times because of the media, many times of because your particular perspective on what is happening in the world. But it is no accident that your particular style of technology allows many, many people to reflect on very specific similar issues at the same time. And globally speaking, this is unique in the history of your planet, where you can now all begin to individually check in, individually assess how you feel according to these issues at the same time, because you are now beginning to act according to positive perspective and create positive results. The negativity is still there. The negativity is still within your awareness, but only as a peripheral event, not happening to you. But yet you can see the full impact of a quote, unquote, seeming to happen to other individuals. So it is part and parcel of the astounding amount of acceleration you are choosing as a still of a civilization to create. Is there something else? It seems then that you don't think that will be. You all understand that we perceive you are going toward one world unity. So this is some of the, shall we say, major initial steps toward doing so, allowing the issues to come up and allowing yourself to see just how many more individuals actually have an integrated, non-prejudicial viewpoint than perhaps was formally thought. Or it is our perception that it is a majority upon your planet that actually has a more integrated perspective on this. Perhaps sometimes the minority may speak a bit louder, but they are a minority no less. Thank you. Does that answer the question? Certainly. Oh, if there is something else you wish to explore, we will come back to you. And we thank you as well. Shutting. Hey, come here. Thank you. Hello, Alon. Good to meet you. Good to meet you. Good to see you as well. Thank you. Well, does our imagination produce our beliefs or do we choose them from a pending incarnation? In a sense, you may realize that you use the tool the facility of your imagination to perceive your beliefs through your imagination. Understand your higher self colloquially seeking creates your physical self through its imagination. So you walk through that gateway automatically. And then we choose from the collectively created belief systems in a particular incarnation? Unless you are a bit more crappy yet. I have one belief system that I can't get rid of. Well, if you said so, obviously you don't. Do share. Well, I've been competing in sports since childhood, and I've had enough competition. I don't want to compete anymore. But when I play tennis, I cannot get rid. I can't stop this. Do you understand that you are still trying to get rid of it, because that is one of the issues, but do proceed. I can't stop this burning desire to win. In the minute we start keeping score. Why are you invalidating that desire? Because I don't like how it feels. Why? It sounds pleasant. It makes it not fun. Now I want to just have fun. I don't want to compete. I don't want to accomplish anything. I just want to have fun. Do you believe that only winning is fun? Not anymore. I think winning...no. Then what is your vested interest in continuing to assume that belief? That's what I'm trying to figure out. Well, do not try, since we share what comes up. Well, when we start keeping score, this thing comes over me. Now, understand, no thing comes over you. It is within you, and you are drumming it up. What is it that you drum up? And what would you prefer to replace it with? It feels if I have to win, and I would prefer to not have to win. Oh, alright. Well, there is an incongruency there, and perhaps that is why it is uncomfortable. Is there also the belief that you simply wish to play the game? Yeah. And when you proceed with simply that belief, how does that feel? It feels great. Because then then we...then this...I start having to win. The minute I start losing, I really... Oh, this awareness, as you say, this thing that comes over you, is it phrase in a sense what it is you are thinking. And understand that as this is happening from this point forward, you can dialogue with the phrases. Braise what I'm saying. I don't think I think it's more like... Don't think you think? Oh, how complicated. Let's assume you do. Thanks. Now, what is the form? Desperation. I think maybe I'm afraid of losing more than I was desiring to win. Then let's look at that. What would happen if you won't? I think...I get afraid of it. Validate that you feel that way and allow it to serve you. Use it. I must identify myself from how...with having to win. Oh, perhaps we can in that sense simply transform it. You understand that you have a particular belief. That you then feel a particular way and then you act a particular way. Using your imagination right here, right now. How would you act if that thought came up but you did not in that sense allow it to take hold upon you? What would be the outward action? I would be relaxed and enjoying myself. What would be the outer attitude? Happy. Happy, hopefully focused, but happy. Oh, in a sense this is not what we are asking however, for happiness is not in that sense in this conversation and action. You never see me on the telephone. Perhaps not. It can be very negative. It can be a very negative feeling. If I didn't have that desire I would feel positive. Oh, simply next time it comes up. First of all remember it is not a thing external to you. It is part of you. It is a feeling from a belief. While it is happening that is the timing to have these dialogues where then it is more relevant to who you are then it is right now recreating it. But the point is you need not settle for it and now that you understand that it is not a thing over you you can understand that it is your choice to simply change your perspective. When you feel that reflect back on what you are believing then remind yourself on what you prefer to believe. State perhaps as you say to use your colloquialism, cold time out. State the new belief within yourself until you feel that. When you feel that use your imagination to see how you would continue the playing of the game. Follow that model or template play the game in that way. If you wish and it comes up again call another time out. Do the same thing. But you will find when you proceed with the action having acknowledged the old belief but having the action of the new belief the effect will change and you will derive the joy of the playing and then have something else to shall we say evaluate when looking at these issues. Is that usable? Yes, absolutely. Will you do that? I will. Will you have a ball? Yes, I will. Oh, do not make too much of a racket. Oh, thank you. For the only one you truly deserve is yourself. And you may also paradoxically find many times when the playing of the game is what is of primary shall we say intention you may find your incidences of winning increase anyway. But it will not be that that has to be the case. You will enjoy it either way. But you will also still have the ability to relish winning without invalidating those who have quote unquote loss. That's great. Oh, thank you. Is there something else? Well, I did want to ask you one thing about dreams. When I dream, I very often seem to take things that have been happening during my waking dream. This is what happens. Then the situation is somewhat altered and seems more confined and less successful. Well, in a sense more confined that you are able to focus upon it whereby it may have simply been a peripheral awareness in the waking dream. But it is one of the ways that you in that sense address the issues that are important to you. If you do not do it in the waking dream, many times you will set up scenarios whereby you will do it within the sleeping dream. So in our sleeping dream, we can still be relating to our waking dream life. Oh, yes. Very strongly. And as the line dissolves between the two, that will more be the case. There will be more of a congruency between this dream and that dream. But at first and right now that you are creating the separation, they can be entirely different realities or parallel versions of the same reality with the same players, same characters, similar relationships, but different circumstance, different events, and a slightly different, you will notice history. In a sense, you are tapping into parallel lives of your same self. You are. It's never this life. When you are asleep. Only subtly, not completely for you, still draw a distinction. But as you dissolve the distinction, the dichotomy, you will find more of relevance. And as you again awaken into this dream and use in any way you can and the information derived from that dream, that ground that dream into this dream. So your willingness to act in this dream from what you have derived from that dream can accelerate that process. That did happen one night. I was dreaming about the LA riots and I woke up and went in to have a snack and I started thinking there is something else I have to learn from that dream. And I realized that it was the Rodney King case. So that was very much judging the jurors and the defense lawyers. And because of the dream, I realized how much I was judging them and I stopped doing that. And I neutralized the situation and invalidated their viewpoint and equalized it. Well, they have been a great service for had that knock in the case. These issues still would have came up, though not in as accelerated a fashion. And that is one of the things we are again discussing, the acceleration. So that was the perfect timing they in a sense made their contribution by allowing, by being who they were and allowing other people to then look at the issues that came up. I could see that because of that dream. Thank you very much. You are beginning to dissolve the lying between the two. And will more and more shall we say have the phenomena, did I dream that or did it really happen? And then you will find sometimes there is a commonality in that dream to this particular life, more and more. Great. We thank you. Thank you. Give me a minute. Hi, Lynn. Grigging. My month has been absolutely whirlwind. It's so bad. Shaking it up. Yeah. And I was wondering if you could tell me anything about the college, from a college that I'm moving into. I just have a feeling that it's very, very significant. There are several issues. But in a sense, you can say it is a form, and we mean this loosely, not in its usual literal sense, but in a specific reason of self discovery and self reflection, a form of self-imposed solitary confinement. And what you will understand is you will begin to lose the importance or significance or need of many of what you have labeled the external symbols through which you define who you are. And begin to cut through all that and look at, without the baggage, who you are, who you have been, and what it is you now wish to transform or continue to transform into. But you will find increased activity in your channeling. You will find increased activity with accessing other forms of consciousness that you have not yet, shall we say, began to interact with. Very exciting. Yes, I sort of thought that's what I thought also. In a sense, you are sending yourself to your own room. Yeah, my small room. Just the right time. Okay, good. I have an animal question. My animals have picked up some kind of skin condition, and so past month I've had to bathe them and poison once a week. And I'm wondering, what is that all about? You tell me. Oh, yes, you do. I do. Thanks. Can you help me? You are willing to take one step, then we shall done. Okay. All right. Yeah. Okay. Before the cottage came up, I was totally overwhelmed, and I was thinking that if I didn't have the animals, I would go to Hawaii. That's the only thing I can think of. Oh, also the idea of breaking down the barriers and allowing yourself to integrate into your reality. In a sense, they have taken on or shunted some of that function for you so that you would not, shall we say, personally create illness within yourself. Now, there is more significance to the bathing in the poison, but we will let you sit with that. Oh, please. Okay. Thanks a step. What do you think is the significance and be creative? I didn't actually get it, I just understood one line, the last line that you said about, then taking this on so I don't understand that your skin generally will represent the barrier through which you quote unquote protect yourself from your environment. You are breaking down many of these barriers in very creative ways to again understand that everything lies within. There are external reflections, but the cause, the original primary frequency is within. Therefore, that can sometimes manifest, or individuals can sometimes create it as difficulties or a rutations from the skin itself. The animals in a sense have done you a service by taking this on. Now, the idea of the poison to cure it is an entirely different scenario and has something to do with the fact that one individual would think, that in order to do something which is beneficial, they would need to do something which is not, and that is as far as we will go with that. And I think that. Can you tell me? Okay. Just say that one more time. In order to do something, to do something that's beneficial. The idea of that the only way to get rid of this skin disorder is to bathe in poison which you generally assume to be a negative toxic idea. There is the underlying idea within you, and again, this will click at some point perhaps in the near future, that in order to create the preferred reality you first need to, I'll write, eat some growth. And that is an idea that is still within you. No need to invalidate it. But by owning it, then you can change it. And that is one of the ideas that you still utilize to hold yourself back. I feel like I want to ask you one more question about that. Go like that. I don't have one. Oh. Then perhaps we will share again. Feel free. Okay. I have two more baths to get. I have two more baths to get back. Is there anything I can do to help in my mind? I feel like I'm killing them. You are not. Thank you very much. And you. Shelly. Nail. Alon. I have. Right here. Here? Yes. Well, it strikes me so coincidental it is. Here is sharing her story. This past week I have been in nature sort of digging fence posts and things and collecting some poison ivy upon my skin, which I've never had an experience of a skin irritation before in my, in this incarnation. So using what you provided her as a stepping stone for my own understanding that this can be sort of exposing my own belief systems about. Well, to some degree in your particular instance there is the addition of things you hold within yourself that are literally erupting now to the surface. So begin to look at what areas you are not looking at and you are denying. That is your strongest opportunity at this point for change. Well, there is a deal of that in terms of my belief systems about my own wealth and my access to wealth and my judgments that I have about wealthy people. Well, do understand that you have hit as you say the nail squarely or roundly or triangulally on the head for the idea is many times. One of the individuals will have conflicting primary belief and here is an example. One primary belief, I wish to have all the money I can. Another primary belief, all people with money are jerks. A third primary belief, I don't wish to be a jerk. Therefore you can now look at the fact that individuals are the way they are because of the law, it is not the symbols around them that determine how they are. And it is not that you must by convention, by obtaining the things that are representative of the amount of abundance you are willing to flow through you, that means you need denigrate your person or that you need become a miser. So many of the ideas surrounding how you feel about people with money and you will have the opportunity now that this is brought to the surface to see many people with a lot of money and see how you react to them. This goes across the board for anyone present in this interaction, for if you do truly believe that you will become ego maniacal, selfish, self-serving, step on the heads of others, and that is the only thing that always happens to everyone when they get money, you can see very clearly where these beliefs conflict and are creating a seeming lack of abundance. So therefore look at where this issue comes up. If you see someone driving in your limousine, see what you think, do you think, oh how nice? I would like one of those, or do you think what must he have done to get back? Do you understand? Yes. Therefore you can now transform them. Find where you do have these perspectives and do not settle for them any longer. Acknowledge them and then redefine it. Well it feels as though my background is changing with this interaction. And as you change who you are in any present moment, your path literally changes as does your future. Obviously if you change who you are in the present, your future will change from the future that you would have had being the old you, so to speak. But this goes in both directions. You also create a new significance to your path. You pluck from what you perceive to be your path. The instances that have allowed you to be who you are right now. So the path changes so does the future. It always seems as though I have lived with wealthy areas around wealthy people without wealth myself. But what have you thought about them? That is the point. It's a series of judgments of many of which you hit the head of mail on the head with. I mean like these jerks and what are they doing to do that? Now understand this is your liberation. This is your ability to try. Also understand very often in regards to abundance, individuals as a quote unquote acquire seemingly more abundance, then seem to have less in common with the individuals that they have quote unquote grown up with. And therefore there is also the consideration of will I have any friends or will I need to hang out with the jerk? Yeah. So therefore again understanding they are not jerks, that if you believe that you will most likely not wish to become that. So you can redefine that particular perspective and point of view. Thank you very much for that. I have one additional. Oh one thing. In the process of this week also I have been digging these fence post holes. And in process in this area of the country we have a lot of rocks. And so every couple of inches they go down I hit a rock which then I have to struggle with and get a crowbar out or whatever. And get this rock out of the hole. Now last night I had a dream where I was showing some woman where I had a dug these big boulders out of the ground. And underneath I had a spacecraft. And I was easily able to move these very large boulders. I'm not sure exactly how I did that. But it was easier than I thought it would be and it seemed to unveil something of considerable what I would like. You know what I would prefer. Well ironically by grounding to your reality that is the way that you are most likely to interact with other civilizations. So perhaps this is symbolic of that as well. But one question. What is it you are sensing out? One in this particular, I'm doing this for a client. Oh. Who wishes to conceal some old cars he has from his neighbor who is trying to sell his house. Who has complained about having to look at these old cars. Oh oh oh. So I'm not sure if that is my issue or not. Primarily though the digging, the rock, the earth is again the grounding aspect. Grounding and understanding that head in the clouds is all right. But it is the feet on the ground which moves the reality. The feet on the ground that transforms your particular manifestation. It is always the action step again that literally midwives the energy into matter. So therefore get crappy. So my willingness to get in there and participate and do this thing which does make it easier when I do that is seemingly what I'm seeking to learn. And our learning. Thank you very much. And to you. For your willingness to continue to expand. Shunning. You are. Hey. Greetings. And to you. I'd like to focus on the environment. June 2 this coming week at Rio in South America. There will be roughly 160 nations participating in a world summit focusing on the condition of the environment of our planet. Hey. And over the various sessions I've heard both Bashar and you indicate that the earth mother earth has a more self healing capability than we realize. Hey, but understand this does not mean that you cannot cause great destruction. This does not mean that you as a society should you choose cannot blow holes in your ozone. Shall we say destroy your rainforest pollute your air pollute your water. It is still an option of your civilization to do so. What we were simply sharing for those with the concern of the overall earth was that there was some more capability than understood for the regeneration. But that is entirely different than the personal issues of each individual getting in touch with their own particular relationship to the planet itself. And your willingness on your own personal level to begin in whatever way you are able from whatever is available to you in any given moment to be the embodiment of an individual only willing to shall we say dovetail your activities to be within environmental integrity. That is what will change the entire planet as well for it will take each individual to do so within themselves then becoming that vibration then attracting other individuals around them of like mine as we had shared congregate shall we say background other individuals. And this will have a ripple literally a rippling effect that will spread around the whole planet. So we do not mean in that sense to say that it is not your responsibility but simply in that sense that there was more to your planet than that your eye. I've had to resist the temptation from these previous brief inputs to just say well just relax don't worry about it mother earth can heal any damage we do. But that is not how we meant it we were simply allowing us to know that your scientists have only scratched the surface in how your planet operates and rejuvenates we did not mean to suggest that the issues surrounding the idea of the pollution of your planet were not of power amount importance both to your self and to your entire planet and again remind you that your own individual willingness to embody environmental integrity is what will bring you the result rippling out and seeing it in other individuals as well. We did not in that sense share it so that you would become complacent now. That's what I decided on my own and I appreciate your confirming and reflecting back to me what I really had decided already appreciate that. Well we thank you for deciding it without needing to check in. Can you elaborate at all though on mother earth capability to heal herself. Well again perhaps for the purposes of continuing along these lines we wish to communicate your personal ability to heal your planet. So therefore when you find yourself doing something as simple as shall we say throwing something shall we say environmentally unsound into the trash your willingness to do that is mirrored and mimicked in those around you. Your willingness to begin to not do that to not settle for less than complete environmental integrity in each and every one of your actions is what will change your relationship to that planet and allow it by again rippling out to heal itself without consistently being re-injured. So your personal ability is 100% in whatever way you are able to demonstrate that type of integrity. Okay this world and you will then also be an example for others to say. This world summit again offers another wonderful opportunity to accelerate unification of our various countries. Do you read the energies as being sort of productive and successful in this world summit. To some degree there will perhaps be a bit less productivity than many would hope but the idea is that the issues will come to the surface and it is very many times the issues coming to the surface of the masses all at once with the opportunity again with the media on your planet at this time which is more of the idea. So things which are not settled to the satisfaction of shall we say the majority of individuals now will give the majority of individuals the opportunity to speak their voice. So therefore it will be very positive even if the particular agreements are quite minimal but there will perhaps be some major agreement yet. One last question on SSani is there any form of pollution and is it a problem can you talk about that. No and no and yes we just do. Thank you very much. And you. Shari. Over there. Thank you. All right. Greetings. Yeah follow the environmental thing. On a personal level I can really angry at other people when I see them you think something even if the surgeon is using some sort of product that is not good. And I are able in an integrated and loving way to whatever degree is available to you to communicate. That is the only service in that instance that you can be. First be a living example of the thing you wish to in that sense have other people see and then be willing to communicate even though you may perceive that is not their particular perspective in a loving enough way that they can actually then hear you. Yeah. Why I said that one guy you were the guy bigger than me and a bigger truck. He didn't take it too well. It will not matter how big the truck is if the communication is unconditionally loving it will be appreciated for what it is. Yeah. Because I feel like there's so many people and on this planet that are just misinformed and uneducated and I don't know if I'm like. But you can use them in the following way. We do not mean manipulate them but use the fact that each time you become aware that somebody is that way. That reinforces that you do not prefer to be that way and therefore reinforces your willingness to not act that way. For then you become a living example of beacon. Others can see that your alternative way is just as possible. Then it is far easier when you are the embodiment of that idea to make that communication in a loving way. For although you would prefer your perspective you are willing to validate their perspective and understand they have the right and reason to choose it. Okay. It's frustration for me. I get angry and I get sad. You know I do the best I can yet I live near the water and I can look in the water every morning and see this slick. But you can also if you will be as a suit look around and see many individuals picking up the trash as well. So where is your attention falling and is it falling on the people who are continuing to do that perhaps can reflect to yourself to what degree you still do it perhaps minor but to whatever degree perhaps that is what you are actually judging. Okay. I will try to look at it differently. I have the podium here. I had some dream questions that I just like to ask. I had a dream about you. We were in an encounter like this which was nice. There is some reason I asked you if it was okay if I had an interaction with someone else in the room. And I'm not sure what that means. I felt like I was breaking some sort of barrier. The point is that there are others in our civilization. There is shall we say one particular being that you can communicate with directly. That is not me but quite similar. You are beginning to now open up to recognize this idea. I wanted to include the other person and I wanted to ask you if that was okay. Always alright. Or from our perspective you are growing expanding and boldly being who you are. Therefore there will always be a matching reflection, a mirrored reflection and from our end this takes the form of another individual. Yes, it is not just the conversation between us but between the three of us. I wanted to complete the triangle. Have a good time. Yes, hold on. I'm not sure how it turned out though. You will be. Also, where I'm living in my house, I live downstairs. There is a woman who owns a house that lives above me. I've been having a great time living there. I've moved there about three months ago. It is a very peaceful place, very tranquil and nice. I'm picking up a lot of her husband's staffs away and I'm wondering what's going on about that. I feel like people lingering around. I don't know if it's 15 minutes. He's not wandering the whole but is still strongly connected to him. Yes. You most likely will not hear any change rattle. I'm not afraid of that. That's okay. Because I do feel present and I'm wondering if it was anything else that you could. You may make it simple together. Say hello. I do. Oh, any time in that sense you have a guest? Treat them as a guest. It's great. Okay, great. And by the way, we thank you and so did you. Oh, yes. Hey, perhaps sometimes you will validate his presence more than she. So he has a move on. Has he moved on? For the time being, shall we say he has engaged in non-physical reality but very strongly connected, so to speak as a guide to that individual. Well, at this point I'd like to share that this lawnmower story I had the other day was really dangerous, but I had to explain more, but it's like I was using his lawnmower and it broke, the blade broke and half went swinging out. It was pretty dangerous. I was pretty scared, but I was thinking of him at the time. And I thought, oh my God, I shouldn't be cutting his lawn. Oh, no, no, no. And by the way, there is one other communication. Nothing personal. I'm home. Okay. And you were not hurt. No, it's been great. Okay. So, and then real quickly in my dream again, I've been dreaming of dolphins, which is nice. I've never done that. You are interacting with intro to Westerol. Yeah. And it's like, I was listening to a past, an old tape. And there was a question about other channels on the planet. You mentioned one dreamer. Hey, in an upcoming interaction, there will be direct communication from that source. Through this channel in these interactions, in an upcoming interaction, perhaps much to the chagrin of the channel. What if I'm here? That's what I was picking up, in my dream, that there were water skiers, you know, many women, water scene. We went and water it into dolphins. And I was wondering, would these dolphins in the water scene, or would that be a screen? Hey, they were dolphin consciousness the whole time. In a sense, you were relating to them as equals, thereby their appearance as humans. As often, when we interact in dream realities with you, you will perceive us as human, simply because you are interacting with us entirely as an equal. But then the distinction was made for identification purposes. And you were literally swimming in their backyard. So, where does this mean to me? So, I'm trying to figure out how to do that. And we say a particular connection to that species, which is, again, from our perspective, one of the two intelligent species upon your planet. Therefore, if you are interested in extraterrestrial, extra-dimensional communication, starting your own backyard, it is accessible. You can actually physically approximate to them. You can interact with them. You can jump right in. And you will find your willingness to play in their particular playground. You will experience a new type of emotional communication, where they do communicate tell empathically. So, right now, I can just continue to demonstrate more. If you wish, you can always invite that, and they will always respond. But perhaps, you will now keep your eyes open for the physical opportunity for it will arrive. Really? If you wish, I'm going to talk to you. No one will force you to have too much fun. That's great. I'm not sure where you can come from. I am on that. Well, how exciting. On our planet, if one individual approaches another and says, how are you doing? How are things going? And that individual says, not as I expected, we always come back with. Congratulations. That is the joy of creation. Not exactly knowing what to expect. But always knowing it will be ecstatic. Great. We'll let this happen for now. I'll let her. She does. Thank you. Thank you. Hold on. No, no. Hi. I hadn't said anything before, but I was going to ask you too about Dauphin. I had had a dream recently, and I had seen Marie Dauphin, and Sheila was with me. And it was really wonderful. But I was surprised when I woke up. I was really relaxed, really comfortable and happy. But I didn't communicate or I did not have any recollection of communicating with the Dauphins in the dream. I was wondering if you could tell me if I'm doing that tone, ethically, or not bringing it back? Well, I understand this again. The medium through which these communications take place is what you call emotion, energy motion. So therefore, since you interpret it through an emotional filter, when you wake up and then analyze it through mental means, it can simply appear no conversation to play. If you will, play around a bit, perhaps close your eyes, relax, take a few breaths, and allow yourself to recreate the scene in your mind, in your imagination, and focus upon the feelings, then you will translate some of that communication. But it is not the grasping through mental means that will allow you to become aware of the communication. It is the feeling in your willingness to translate that feeling, but first recreate it. Feeling wonderful. So play around with that. And while you are recreating that feeling, which then literally means you are the vibration of that feeling, many of the communications can then filter down and make some sense analytically. But first must be, shall we say, invoked emotionally. All right. I was wondering also, all my life has had dreams, underwater, or living in cities above the water, or cities underneath the water, and also dreams of swimming underwater. And even a few times, I do scuba dive. But this is a two-fold connection. One would be Atlantean, shall we say, in terms of being connected to that particular civilization in many lives, but also understand something that we have not discussed very often, but which does occur from time to time, less often now than in your shall we say historic path. But this is why you are feeling that. Because of the similarity in sentient consciousness, self-reflective thinking consciousness between the patients, what you call dolphin and whales, and humans, you in that sense, particularly in more of the Atlantean frame of your history, directly from time to time would reincarnate as a dolphin, and also from time to time, particular dolphins would reincarnate as humans. Now they are primarily dolphins, and you are primarily humans in this particular dimension of experience, but there was the overlapping, the overcrossing, the cross exploration, if you will. So you in that sense have done that many times. Oh yes, you can in that sense, by simply recreating those feelings, create many flashes, many memories. You are very strongly connected to this as our several individuals present. Thank you for calling on me, I am really thank you for sharing the gift of who you are with us. It's wonderful that you could even sense that I was going to discuss that. We thank you for your willingness to be bold. Thank you. At this time, we will pause for a short break of 10 to 15 minutes of your counting. We will resume contact with the adorable at that time. Oh no.
