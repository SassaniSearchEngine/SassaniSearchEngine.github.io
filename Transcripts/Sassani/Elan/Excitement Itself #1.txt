 All right, I'll pray, greetings this evening of your time as you create time. How are you all? Oh, thank you. Allow me to begin this interaction with the entitlement. Excitement itself. Allow me to explain with a few foundational ideas so that we may provide commonality between us for the proceeding of this interaction. First of all, understand, foundationally, fundamentally speaking, you are all consciousness in your pristine state, what you call your soul, your higher self, your total self, the many different words and labels and definitions that you have for that is simply your consciousness itself. And you are part and parcel of the prime consciousness that you call God, that we call all that is. So therefore, consciousness is the primary frequency itself. And this is the stuff, so to speak, of which you are truly made, your body and your physical reality, though it is an apparent that you exist within your body and physical reality. Actually, technically speaking, exists within your consciousness, not the other way around. So therefore, perhaps you can say for the purposes of reference and point of view, your body is at the center of the sphere of your conscious method. This particular understanding again lays down a foundation and also lays down the extent to which you actually create your own reality for again, by extension, you are not even truly within a reality. The reality is within you. It is not that dissimilar from what you call waking up in the morning from your quote unquote sleeping dream, which we call dream reality, sleeping dream reality. When you are within your sleeping dream, you are engaged. Your senses are experienced. You feel. You see. You hear. You touch. You smell. You taste. It is real while you are there and no one while you are dreaming, except perhaps an incrant congruent with this physical reality can convince you otherwise. Yet when you wake up, you come to the realization, well, I guess that reality was actually within me. And this is a direct analogy to how your higher self or over soul dreams your physical self into reality. Therefore, when you quote unquote die or transform from this particular point of view, you have a similar realization, a similar sensation that's a very concrete reality that you used to exist within actually exists within you. This is at least a sense of this idea, that analogy that we have shared. You are consciousness. The expression of your consciousness is your physical reality. Your pure consciousness is totally connected to your physical consciousness, to your physical self. You are not disconnected from God or all that is, and you are not disconnected from your soul or higher self or full self. You create the transparency, but this is the degree of your power. And when you begin to recognize or again feel connected, you bring along with that the realization that you truly have always been connected, that you are exploring seeming to be disconnected but are truly connected. You are always an expression of all that is, you are always an expression of your higher self, no exception. There are particular signs, perhaps you can say that your higher self will be queen or send to your physical self, allowing you to align, allowing you to re-align to the purposes of that higher self. The particular vibratory translation that we are sharing with you this evening is what you refer to as excitement. For our definition of excitement is that excitement itself is the vibratory energy that tells you in no uncertain terms that the thing that you are excited about is most you from what is available in the situation. For willingness to use that excitement as a barometer, to use that excitement to validate the message from your higher self by acting upon that thing that excites you with integrity. Creates the life that you say that you prefer. Now we do at this point make the distinction of acting upon your excitement with integrity and understand that when we say integrity, we mean integrity as coming from the word integration which is a realization, not a moral standard. The realization that everything does exist within you by extension can also be stated is that everything is all one thing, one event within you. Therefore one integrated interwoven syncrenistic reality. Your willingness to begin to look at it that way and act as though it is an extension of you. Act as though everything is a reflection within you. Acting in that manner from that orientation is from the perspective of integration or with integrity. So when you are looking at the things that excite you, truly understand that you have all the power you need to create anything that you desire or are excited about without harming yourself or someone else. For again, someone else is simply a reflection of you anyway. And if you are treating everything that you interact with as an extension of yourself and affording that degree of respect to everything, your actions always then express your knowing that you contain that degree of power. Perhaps there is the appearances at stepping over the heads of others to get what you want is a powerful expression. But it is truly from our perspective and understanding the expression of helplessness, your lessness, not believing that you actually have enough power to do it without harming someone else. One person winning at the expense of another is simply one truth, one reality. It is not the only truth or the only reality. And what you commonly refer to as win-win situations are another truth, another reality. So therefore you have that degree of power to create your own reality. If you begin to be crafty enough at this point, having perhaps different habits, to begin to remind yourself of it, and in that sense, align yourself with the intention to act in this way, with the intention to express that power without it being at the cost of yourself, self-denial, or at the cost of someone else, denial of other reflections of yourself. So therefore this is the degree of your power. And therefore in aligning with that power, in aligning with your purpose in life, your excitement is a never-ending and constant indication of your purpose. From moment to moment to moment, there is the distinction of these things that you are most excited about as perhaps being one of the main purposes in your life. But also do we speak in each and every given moment, there are always a series of choices that are available, immediately acceptable. And using your excitement to that degree in the moment from what is available, choosing from those choices with your excitement as the criteria that you will not settle for left hand, and then acting upon that option in whatever way you can within your full integrity creates new effect in your mind. Because you are acting from an excited perspective and with integrity, the result can only be an exciting result. And the result can only be a result that is within integrity, therefore not harming you or anyone else. Now you already live by placing trust in whatever your criteria or barometer is at this point. So in a sense you already do this, but in general rather than doing so, utilizing your excitement, which is uniquely your own vibration. Most often due to societal tendencies and the spoon feeding, as you are growing up of societal belief systems, you will align yourself rather than to the excitement, to the idea which perhaps we will call everyone knows you should do this or that. You align yourself to what others say you should be doing rather than what you know in your heart is an expression of who you are. You are not being someone else. You are interacting with the reflection you call someone else, but are choosing to be the point of view that you are. And therefore only you can truly know what is in that sense exciting and within integrity for you when you begin to function again in this way, you replace the results that you already get by following what everyone says you should or should not do. The results that many of you have in your life at this point are the results of conforming to the everyone knows reality rather than checking in with your own internal understanding, your own internal method system and beginning to react and respond from that perspective, which is your total self empowerment. For the reason that something distinctly excites you and perhaps no one else around you is that that is your signature, your particular signal that that thing is most you, not most them. They perhaps will benefit paradoxically by watching you actually do that thing that they are not excited about, for they have attracted you to their reality and they can green positive meaning from anything that they attract into their presence, into their experience. But this will far more directly positively affect you for you are now being consciously by choice demanding to be the person you chose to be from your own criteria, your own heart, following your own excitement, your own passion, the things that give you going and once again only can you truly know that. Therefore we introduce to you the idea of factoring into what you generally refer to as your spiritual growth, your excitement and we do so as a gift for in general many of the spiritual orientations upon your planet are strongly steep in denial of the physical self as though the only way that one could express spirituality is to deny the results of the very choices that you have made to be in this life, to create this life. Even though that you have chosen to create this life, make no bones about that and therefore you have chosen to experience or express your spirituality through the physicality of this life. Qualitatively speaking there is nothing fundamentally any less spiritual about physical reality. It is actually an expression of spirituality, an aspect, a fact of spirituality. So your willingness to function within that physicality, utilizing again your underlying understanding of the oneness of all things, results in your functioning within integrity, within the choice that you have made to be physical. And therefore you express your spirituality through the physical, through your willingness to unconditionally love yourself and love others. You change the face of the physicality. Functioning from excitement creates results with integrity, creates results with integrity that there is no reason to deny or turn from. They are the joyful expression of your spirituality. There are many truths and many ways and there is truly not any one way to realize your spirituality. The ideologies upon your planet of denial are in a sense one way to go about it and we are not denigrating or chastising or berating that approach. However, what we are saying is that that is not the only way, simply one way. And paradoxically is not always the quickest way. Paradoxically utilizing your physicality through your integrity is truly a more accelerated methodology to begin to express spiritual aspect again in the form of unconditional love of self and others through this life, through the choice of this physical life. Then you are truly getting down to the business of what you have, shall we say, created this reality to its theory. And paradoxically very often will then begin to expand so to speak into the next phase of your reality. Therefore now you are at the precipice of what we will sometimes refer to as third density reality which is physical existence in three dimensions so to speak although there is the fourth dimension of time. In a physical way exploring certain limitations in belief to experience yourself as actually seeming as separate, separate from everything else and separate from all that is. So the next phase of physicality where you still remain physical we will refer to as fourth density and in that you are less than you are more expanded those feel physical. That physical exploration however begins to take into account your creatorhood with all the stoppers pulled out with no limitation. You begin to experience limit leftness in as far as that is possible within physical reality. As a society you are on the precipice of third and perhaps you can say you are third transitional fourth density being. This is a very exciting time upon your planet for this is the transformation from that third density to that fourth density and this is not about to begin next month or next year or in a few days but has already began and this is one of the reasons that we are able to communicate with you at this time or prior to this simply there would not have been enough commonality for much sense to have been made from many of the things that we share. Your society was not willing to look at many of these ideas as being possible but now that you are in full swing within your transformational age enough individuals have considered these possibilities to make a difference in what you would call your overall mass consciousness the combined consciousness in your planet to create enough of a momentum for different aspects of consciousness that you generally perceive to be more alien than your day to day consciousness to begin to communicate with you in many different forms. That is why you are now seeing the bubbling up of these many different directions of thinking and many different gifts and offerings of ways that you can choose from choose to be. I once again remind you that no way is discreetly unto itself the only way not even what we are sharing and simply it is a way that has worked for us and that as we have interacted with members of your society have given us the feedback that it does in fact work for them and quite simply and with excitement which is perhaps you can play a nice touch. You can in that way be miserable and suffer your way to higher consciousness or you can begin to have a good time laugh and enjoy your way to higher consciousness. This is the alternative that we offer for again it has worked for our society and not because it is us or that we in any way shape or form or any better qualitatively than you we are not we are simply more expanded but because the timing beckons to us the readiness the willingness the searching from your society has found us and allows us to interact with you in a more blatant way though it is not quite the timing to interact face to face physically. This is something that will be possible shall we say within the next five to ten perhaps fifteen of your years depending upon again the mass choices the mass consciousness. This is a very exciting time upon your planet. It has been quote unquote predicted in many different forms and many different ways over many different eras of your history. In the time that those predictions were rendered society was so structured that there was a sensing of the great change itself but with the structures that were in place at the times of the prediction sense could only be made of such great change by first understanding that there would be the tearing down the complete tearing down of the old structure before a new one could be fully instilled. So therefore embedded into these quote unquote predictions is very often an apocalyptic or negative outcome based on again the interpretation through the methodologies of the times that such a grand change could only occur by first tearing down completely the old reality. This is no longer so. This is no longer necessary. It is quite possible in that sense though you will see much bubblings up within the next few years upon your planet of what you call violence. It is quite possible and it is our perception that your mass consciousness has decided to not annihilate yourselves by nuclear means thus making some of the smaller bubblings up a bit more safe to get out of your system. But it is not our perception that you will experience and perceive the transformation in negative terms unless you carry around the fear that you will. For fear is the same as saying that something that you do not prefer the thing that you fear is most likely. So if you blindly simply continue to fear you are actually distracting the very thing you say you do not prefer by stating that you actually believe it to be most likely. If you use that fear if you understand that fear as any emotion simply is the window to a belief that emotions do not exist within a vacuum and that all emotions are the result of a belief and begin to ask yourself what must I believe to be fearing such an outcome. You will begin to let yourself in admit to yourself the least that you may still hold which no longer serve you and your experience will depend upon your belief where they are the foundation of your actions and your actions create your reality. So therefore if you believe in a negative outcome you will in general perform actions that will attract you to the highest degree of likelihood of experiencing a negative outcome. If you acknowledge that you believe that acknowledgement is the first key to changing a belief and in fact you cannot change until you first acknowledge it. So by allowing an emotion to deliver a belief you can create the joyous appreciation for now that you acknowledge that perhaps very limiting unpreferred belief only then can you change it in a way quite similar to how you shall we say perpetuated the old belief to begin with. You simply after acknowledging the old belief I believe in a negative outcome acknowledge the new belief I believe in a positive outcome and compare in your mind's eye how one who believes in a negative outcome or how you up to this point having believed in a negative outcome act because of that belief you will see a pattern to your actions that actually allow you to use your actions as a window to tell you what you believe you always act according to what you state you believe. So therefore in stating the new preferred belief I believe in a positive outcome and using your imagination to furnish how a person would act who believes that you will see a different set of actions come forth in your imagination and they will then be available for you to choose as your action should you choose the actions reflective of the positive belief that I expect a positive outcome then you create the momentum of events leading to that positive outcome and you create a vibration that attracts to you the positive outcome even under the same exact set of circumstances. Two individuals can literally be standing next to each other one embodying the negative expectation or expectancy one embodying the positive and a roof can fall on one and the other will sit there scratching their head still being aware of the negativity but not experiencing it to any degree and this brings us to a final point. Understand the distinction between exploring something mentally and experiencing where you can literally explore any idea though you have the saying that thoughts are things they are not directly seen in between the thoughts and the manifestation are the actions and if those actions are not performed you will not manifest the things from that particular belief. Therefore it is safe to look at any belief within you even ones that are disturbing for if you are not acting according to those beliefs the mere thinking of them has no effect. This gives you the license to begin to freely view and review the things that you believe understanding that they cannot destroy and in fact perhaps keeping them in place through denial rather than acknowledging and transforming them actually gives them more power to seemingly have a negative outcome. So explore a way feel free to explore the many ideas within you but simply cease to act until you have made a conscious choice of what you wish to believe and again through your imagination extrapolated how one with the new preferred belief would act. This factors in very strongly with what we have referred to as your excitement for in each and every given moment if you truly express that you believe in yourself and you believe that you deserve to create a positive life then your excitement in each moment is the ultimate reflection the ultimate barometer of the most positive possible outcome according to your purpose in life. So as this conversation did begin with excitement I will now as a neat bookend in that sense close it with excitement again reminding you that your reality is up to you. You do create however in two ways one way is consciously through the way that you know that you create but the other way is unconsciously and what this simply means is the results of the beliefs that you have either bought into not understanding that you had any other choice or beliefs that you bought into not all together on the conscious level. As you begin to allow your emotions to deliver the least to you you empty that closet which is not bottomless it is quite finite as you have a negative emotion and deny it back into the closet does that be least go as you have a negative emotion and acknowledge it you then give yourself the power to again assert the new belief compare the actions of the old and new belief and consciously perform the actions according to the new belief thereby transforming very simple very simple this is already how you create your reality again what is unconscious or what is not immediately obvious will come off once you make the decision that you wish to begin to transform your beliefs according to preference and in general the most powerful negative limiting belief will be revealed unto you by the most powerful negative limiting emotion so you need not be afraid to dive into your emotions again they cannot harm you in any way unless you act according to that fear and then therefore through actions manifest the very things you say you don't prefer but if you insert a pause and do not act until your intentions are clarified you begin to clarify your manifestation you begin to clarify the expression of your life according to preference thus it makes sense well thank you therefore allow me to proceed to the exchange the interchange for though you will in general perceive that you will in interacting with us receive great gifts understand that from our perspective we receive great gifts as well for though we are expanded and though we choose in that sense not to express limitation at this time we do not know everything and therefore we do learn expand and grow and each aspect of all that is which is what we view you as a facet of the same all that is crystal that we are each aspect that we become familiar with allows us to increase the definition of our reality that much more and this is of great service to us as much as you perceive that it is to you so again allow me to begin by thanking you and expressing my unconditional love and appreciation for your willingness to communicate with us in this way though it be unconventional upon your planet and to communicate with me as an equal for that is always how I will view you and that is always how I will remind you that I and all of us from this end view you have equal completely equal different different expansion different definitions different explorations but the same quality and that quality is perfection you very often are shall we say oh my lead to believe that you are striving to achieve perfection but this is the dangling carrot that perhaps you will never in that sense truly feel you will realize for the power adopters you are always perfect you are always a perfect reflection of whatever it is you are exploring a 100 percent perfect reflection therefore perfection is not something to achieve but something to simply realize you already contain and as you shift your emphasis you become then a perfect reflection of the new emphasis therefore we are all perfect reflection of whatever it is that we are exploring at any time and in this life I ask you how I may be of service to you don't be shy you know I'm reading afternoon good day although Tony's here I'll beat him to the punch where are you right now right now I am aboard my scout craft orbiting my home planet of ex-pilot who else is in that scout craft besides you presently I am with one other be male or female you know I'd hear that oh my god my question is I wonder what does all that is do these days for its excitement well you are a living example perhaps you can say everything that is joyous about what you experience with none of the judge the judgment is your individual exploration all that is being fully unconditionally loving imposes no condition has no judgment so everything that is positive about you all is the ecstatic joyful experience of all that is more universal being created now who said there are always new universes in that sense being created for again though you are experiencing and creating an expression of what you call linear time all that is universal consciousness is infinite with no beginning no middle and no ending so what you perceive to be linear is ever ongoing and also though aspects within it will seem to have a beginning middle and ending physical reality itself as a whole complete idea is also infinite how far in the fourth density do we have to get before we can understand concept of infinity to some degree in your third transitional fourth density reality you are able to begin to understand aspect of it as you embody a more fourth density way of being you become more experientially aware of this for again it will be more of an experience than an analyzation and analyzation is perhaps you can say an attempt to put infinite concept into some kind of finite sense so as you begin to shift the emphasis from analysis not shall we say get rid of it all together it has its purpose but away from it being the soul mean to interpret you begin to get more of an experiential sense of the being net of infinity so as you enter forth you will be more experientially aware of it as you so to speak experience through fourth become more and more aware of it and then when you in that sense become fifth density which would roughly correspond to the first density that would be called non-physical you will really begin to get an experiential sense of it you will begin to be approaching the beginning so to speak this is quite colloquial and almost a bit paradoxical but the beginning of infinite net okay I'll point this out a little bit what's the difference between a an angel and a saint well in general by your own terminology a saint will be a human individual who walks the earth and is generally posthumously awarded that title for one reason or another what you call angelic consciousness can come from many sources and are generally interpreted in that way where they are not completely existing within the same dimensional reality as yourself and in shifting their vibration to become of like enough vibration to be perceived by you can still look somewhat transparent they are also certain extra terrestrial shall we say entities that present themselves in what you will colloquially refer to as light body that many times will be interpreted as an angelic one last comment are you aware that the only reason we're all here is because something happened there next to the pyramids in carol well that is not strictly true that is nearly one of the minute details met as physically speaking everyone who is here is again here by no accident and is here because this is exactly what it will behoove them to hear regardless of what they choose to do with it or what we share will either be of complete use to you or you will find something else and therefore cannot move it but there was no accident that somehow this all came about well unless you wish to assume this to be the one extraneous thing in creation it is nearly synchronicity it is in having the intention and maintaining the clear intention the details working themselves out through synchronicity through co-incidentally not accidents but incidents is occurring at the same time interwoven seemingly unrelated but again because everything is one expression one idea by definition they must be really some wonderful new relationships have been created thank you very much well thank yourself you have created and understand that many more are too fun should you simply continue to be true to who you are they will occur according to preference in an accelerated climate oh thank you I want to ask you some questions about guys or how many kinds of guys are there some would be being who are in 6 or 6 7 women and some would be your own your own Harrison well there is no discrete number that we will put upon it at this time but the idea is that there are many different forms and expressions and explorations of consciousness which can from time to time communicate or create a common vibration with your reality so that some commonality and sense can be made of the interaction very often many of what you call your mediums will in that sense communicate with what you colloquially refer to as reincarnational individuals in between lives but that is merely one expression there are again other realities altogether which have some degree of commonality with your reality and some which have very little degree with your commonality and depending upon the explorations of those particular shall we say trains of consciousness they will communicate and create ways to communicate with and through individuals from many different realms we will represent physical being actual living the screen perhaps you can say colloquially flesh and blood being who exist upon a planet similar in many ways to your own with many differences who have developed telepathic communications between all members so therefore it is not very difficult for us once again you as a society create enough commonality for us to simply use our typical method of communication with each other to then by extension communicate with you but there are also possibilities of communicating with many other realms is there something specific you wish to discuss in this regard do we have the same guys throughout our journey journey of the soul this will occur from time to time but is quite rare or again if it is a reincarnational guide many times you will live lives with these souls and then from time to time work particular in specific reasons when you choose to reincarnate a particular shall we say soul mate mostly speaking may choose to simply remain behind the scenes for that money thereby providing an anchor perhaps you can take say to certain spiritual realms but in general in general each guide is also on their own explorative path and you need not have a guardian angel for you create your own reality you are not drowning and though it is a companion and someone to share with by no means do you need anything other than who you are and what you have it is a perk is it necessary to know who your guide is and in other words if you don't know who they are and how many and what they are doing it's and if that's clear general you will strongly align to one to two guys now there are exceptions depending upon the exploration but many times even if you are interacting with merely one or two at first while you are familiarizing yourself with expanded being who choose to express themselves in more expanded terms than your own again not better simply more expanded you will perceive them as being many many individuals and as you begin to get used to the idea used to the feeling of them they will seem to combine and coagulate down to one or two what I don't understand is why they don't communicate with me the way I would like them to well who is your perception of who they are who are not doing what you wish I understand they are my guides but they don't send me anything they just are there but they don't see who they are what again why do you assume this to be extreme why do you assume that you need to be in any different communication than you already are obviously you have guide consciousness that you are in direct communication with are you saying you wish to have more not more communication but more information oh well you can get them from the clearest most open source and any other guide consciousness can come through that one conduit you need not separated out and create many more complex shall we say relationship simply allow the information to come in the path of least resistance which you are doing but accept that and then either if there is a again particular reason one guide may stand out to say something in particular but you may find often that that is simply not necessary and would become quite confused what you said before made a lot of sense in my for me you said analyzing and experiencing and I just realized that I have been doing too much analyzing well just the right amount to realize that you may wish to do that and wondering do you have a guide well not really in a sense perhaps you can say I am in touch with many consciousness that are not of the physical realm that I exist within but to call them a guide at this point would simply be an athlete they are simply friends acquaintances touching base now and then for I guide my own reality fully consciously ironically with eyes open my in that sense choose according to my excitement and literally without any exception whatsoever live in the way that I began sharing with you in this interaction choosing from what is available with my excitement acting upon that excitement everyone else in the society is doing the same thing in there is a very complex interwoven common at times and individual at times experience therefore we all flow to and pro with each other and sometimes alone in ecstatic joy and your mere ability to even understand the words that I have just shared is your shall we say indication that you contain that ability I have been listening to you and I let all these ideas are just incredibly way nice ideas but I find it frustrating to see to explain that it's not possible to frustration is not being in the moment frustration is perhaps you can say utilizing the moment to extrapolate of what is scenario to look back upon something which is perhaps not relevant to the moment at the cost of what is in the moment you need not create frustration and simply when you feel that remind yourself well how interesting I'm frustrated must not be in the moment all right push that aside what is right in front of my face look at that this excites me you're back in motion no frustration however you have hit upon something in a sense that is also quite healthy and that is what you may find as being a particularly motivating factor at first when just beginning to look that you might deserve creating a life according to excitement a good sign is being excited about excitement itself so therefore use that if it excites you to think that what excites you can create your life that is a very positive beginning that tells you that that rings true with you the frustration is simply all right analyzing yourself out of the moment so to speak yes actually thank you oh thank you you have created well how exciting and welcome to the moment now I noticed that a lot of people who live in the moment are not professionals they're not usually first children or only children so in that case by the way that is observational based on the filters of your perceptions and the least our particular scanning would say that do not be completely accurate there is not such a pattern inherent it is simply a potential that lies within all being and different beings will use different triggers to begin to real so that that being a belief system that I have I was wondering if then we do choose to become first to become first born well absolutely but not necessarily for that reason well for whatever reason you find that being first born was an advantage or allowed you to look at a particular thing in other words as many reasons as there are first born okay is there something specific that you are exploring well just living in the moment I find that I really enjoy that and I just see that there are other people that you find that things get done by living in the moment oh yeah I think so I think there is one of the places that many in your society hang up the assumption that well if I enjoy myself if I do what excites me everything will go to all right hell in a handbasket and in general what creates that effect is doing what excites you facing judging that you had done so and then in that period creating certain effects that give you the negative effect and ascribing the negative effects to the excitement but when you perform the excitement in enough of a succession to create a momentum to replace the momentum that you've already created unconsciously then the paradoxes all the details get handled all the bills get paid everything falls into place if the universe has supported you here to four to this point not completely being who you are in denial of who you choose to be then why would one then assume that the universe would not support you that much more when you are willing to begin to unfold according to press and thereby provide abundance to allow you to continue to create according to preference I do find that well there you go okay and then I have another question thank you for that okay there are some extra stress jills around named Enoch and dramana where it formed the Genesis alliance have you heard of them can you tell me what their intentions are we are not familiar with that nomenclature however if you will describe that will allow me to stand okay these are being what are the source of the information and what is it purporting to be okay they're purporting to be an alliance that claims to their intentions are to have people bring in their full presence so that we don't leave our bodies and go to other places yeah from the fear and segregation that we have created by being physical and they're recruiting a lot of people to work with them and it seems like they are very single-minded in terms of the people that are joining them are seeming not to do anything else in their lives but to join this alliance and be fully present in their bodies we are not completely familiar with the reference though can tell you in no uncertain terms that there are several extra terrestrial sources in touch with your climate at this time that have been some of them for many thousands of your years in one four or another that there is an overall association of approximately between 300 and 400 civilizations that we are aware of only between perhaps you can say four and six or five or seven of which are in touch with your civilization and many will choose to assist behind the scenes but how you will identify them is they will generally present themselves not as being able to provide you with anything that you don't already contain or again do something for you or you are the only one that can create your own beyond we are not familiar with the reference but that does not altogether mean that it is not something on some other identification level that we are familiar with is there any more you can provide do they purport to be from a particular location I haven't heard about these. No. They were they presented themselves as being walking an hour and a half of them they should know that is not entirely accurate and that they were created for the purpose of coming into human bodies to explore what it is that is wrong with us so to speak. Well in a sense if this is truly accurate they will find nothing as well you are functioning you are perfect reflections again of whatever you are exploring now in this particular instance for approximately the past 25,000 years of your planet history you have been exploring limitation so therefore there is a fascination with your mastery of limitation you are all masters of limitation and we mean this in the fondest way for mastering any particular exploration is perhaps you can take the top most level of achievement of exploration of that particular point of view or approach so many times individual consciousness from extraterrestrial societies will interact by incarnating into your society in that sense to experience your degree of separation and bring that back as a symbol to their own planet but none of these civilizations that we are discreetly aware of would approach it would approach you from the perspective that there is something wrong simply being fascinated and curious about what you have chosen to explore and once again from my perspective there is absolutely nothing wrong it is a perfect reflection. And on another way to an issue that surrounds this that Alton has discussed and has to do with our whole multi-dimensional being and the way I understand Kena Kenan dramada to work their end result was unity you know it was a beautiful purpose what they felt that they could do to help create this unity was to create an energy field around an individual and help bring in their full preference as they call it which in my understanding was to help bring in our various multi-dimensional aspects. Well that is one way to understand that following your excitement in the moment of the same it literally creates that energetic field that you emanate from yourself anyway for they or any external source does not technically speaking create a field around you. They make a suggestion or provide a conducive atmosphere for you to match their suggestion or offering you create the energy very often ascribing it to an external source but you are the only one who can experience your own energy so even in interacting with me individuals will often say well I feel your energy but I understand technically speaking that is an activity you feel your version of matching my energy and that is all you can ever truly feel your own version your own creation so therefore should you feel that any source bequeats something unto you you may now go the next step to understand that they simply reveal that you already can change that and no one can actually technically speaking give anything to you that you don't already have the mere fact that you can understand something tells you are no uncertain terms that you must contain it or if you did not contain something to begin with then a concept would make no sense is this a decision oh thank you if there are any other questions of this regard please share it do not it's a pleasure being with you and mine it's um felt like everything that you said was I was still in alignment with oh nine two there's something going on I think it's poor density from relational business coming home the work that I do as an alligator should not come here but within within me oh thank you quite an I want to thank you then look in the mirror and thank you so we will be thanking me as well for I am a creation within your realm from your perspective from my perspective you are a creation in my realm and in fact from my perspective this entire interaction is taking place as I am laying shall we say supine upon a particular table called a projection table in my imagination very often the difference is however I trust my imagination therefore I assume you are truly good you too can trust your imagination you are actually going to answer it okay the work is magnificent and it's going to keep expanding as I'm perhaps more technically is I'd like to know in the domain of how I interact with large groups and she's doing this type of play what would be the next step in expanding the horizons so that people can get in touch with their own well-being and magnificent in a much faster way oh excellent question let's get practical and involve you in the process what excites you perhaps something that may not seem to be immediately available but what excites you in a way or as a way to express it in action seeing movement with people seeing a recryment of their joy in the magnificent that they have question what about yourself I'm very interested do you understand that your strongest gift that you can give is to be the very embodiment of what you have just for for in telling someone about this perhaps generally in the way you are all brought up it sounds like but in being that way you show them not because you are doing it for them but simply because of this who you are and they have attracted you to perceive you but you show them look this is actually possible here is a living example not sounds like if I could only do that I am the example well are you happy yes you do what it's I see yes do you have abundance from it yes you then become an example and what I am sharing becomes more obtainable or more acceptable for individuals tend to latch on to such example when you in attempting so to speak to share a viewpoint in six or convince someone of it that is the expression that you do not fully believe in yourself but when simply offering it unconditionally as a gift with the receipt in case they choose the return it then you are doing a service to them and by then reinforcing what you have offered not forced out their throat but reinforcing what you have offered through action for example through the joy through the excitement through the living of your own life that is a true place for that let's one see what this is possible I didn't think so there's the proof so by example first of all be the exact way from this point forward that you have imagined you would enjoy seeing other people for as you act that way you create the results of that a line of that vibration and what happens is you then attract either other individuals of like mine or interestingly enough that same aspect within others that you have already known that you have not interacted on that level but when you shift the level of who you are not mentally not analytically but through action you shift your perception and you also literally shift the vibratory reality whereby and through which you interact with other individuals so the bottom line is as you change others seem to change for you are now interacting with that match new level within them the ones that are not willing to explore that will seem to gravitate away from your physical proximity in one way or another but either you will begin to attract many individuals now that you are being that way that are also being that way for like attract like in that way and or you will also see individuals who never even seem to have an inkling of this beginning to express it in subtle weapons so if you truly wish to see this idea then be this idea and I keep explaining that it's um what I would like to know is why do so many of us have to in our language hit the wall first people we do the right well that is simply one way to do and none of you have to do any though very often through certain suggestions and tendencies in your society you have a particular tendency to believe that if you hit bottom everything else is up but that is only one way to look at another way to look at it is when you go downhill you go much faster but the point is it is all perspective nothing in your life is extremely and everything as an event as a statement as a circumstance is a neutral set of props whereby you are the assigner of the meaning you supply the meaning to the neutral set of props or people or events and the meaning you assign determines the effect you get out but the exact same event can yield every single possibility of an outcome depending on which meaning you plug in and your willingness to begin to look at these situations as a creator and the creator looks at why I create something not why is this happening to me you begin rather than saying this is very bad and therefore life thinks you begin to say well on the surface this obviously looks quite negative in this society this when it happens is generally referred to as negative but now I am looking at my reality as a creator so therefore I acknowledge the negative interpretation but I also acknowledge the blank prop and I also acknowledge that if I created it there is service to be gleaned from it if you then ask how is this of service to me exactly the way it is you take the same prop and get a different effect and allow it to serve you and as you allow each event to serve you shall we say you are quite sure those are the same therefore redefine your reality according to preference and glean the positive meaning after having acknowledged the negative assignment then you cannot create any other effects that are negative from this point forward and therefore we'll never seem to spiral downward again that is simply a common there is also very strongly again bought into in your society the idea that karma or one of the definitions of karma is that for every five minutes of extreme ecstasy you must create five minutes of misery for a balance and I again share with you that all ways are valid all truths are true and that is one way obviously to create and one way obviously to look at it and one effect you can obviously get but you need not again think that's the only way expanding consciousness in a world of polarity positive and negative will expand your awareness of both positive and negative but what you experience is once again always completely determined by your action so therefore you can be aware of negativity but it will be through others if your actions are all positively aligned only will your experience be positive is that yeah I believe that we're treating our reality and that we are our own creators and it depends on the filter system that we've had the way that we choose to look at our life in which direction positive or negative and I agree well thank you thank you for allowing me to reflect back to you what you already did personal experience for the last um oh I think you're in a house and it's been experiencing what I would call an opening so to speak I've been having these very different things come in good with me all of a quite very nature well how exciting no it is most recently I had this beautiful little helicopter type face craft wake me up in the middle of the night um I was very proud to what that symbolized um I see it I'm open up and I see it my eyes are open and I see these things this one oh gosh tiny thing never stay long enough for me to talk to them um so that's why now you were what is the approximate time oh this one was maybe four inches and a lot of colors I could almost feel the rainbow colors in it outlining the craft it felt like a helicopter but it didn't I never hear it I didn't hear anything this time oh it is not what you would call colloquially a helicopter oh no what you are perceiving is an inter-dimensional craft and the dimension from which it is piercing from shall we say has shall we say only some commonality to your own so when interpenetrating into your dimensional reality there will be shall we say a seeming confusion in the relative sizes of things to them they are quite large in that sense when interpenetrating your reality they may be perceived in this way but the overall signal the overall sign that you are receiving is that your vision is beginning by choice by preference and agreement to expand to include things that are not generally accepted by the mass consciousness agreement why don't they say so I can talk to them I mean this came out of love yeah what what don't leave look out um perhaps I'm not ready for the communication is that it first of all rather than saying don't leave next time perhaps stay you will find again to be more understood so perhaps the negative and positive interpretations are not completely understood but also understand that the communication that would occur will occur on a consciousness limit and may even appear to be or appear as you thinking to yourself so broaden the definition through which you will allow the communication and once again understand that distinction it is not making it happen it is allowing it to happen it is not an attempt or an effort it is an effort less slow and allow simply again if you issue the invitation and they pop out simply trust the timing as well or there are degrees of getting your feet left I understand that completely um I have another question um last year when I was taking the medicine class I was reading a book about Scotland and was looking at it thinking oh my goodness Scotland represents the heart of the world one okay one of them can you um is there a simple way that you could explain what the continents represent in terms of body heart you will find this to be quite arbitrary and interpretable it will mean different things to different people suffice it to say that there are many points upon your planet that are vortexes of electromagnetic energy nodal point focal point if you will that have characteristic routing of the electromagnetic flow of your planet these areas provide balance these areas provide certain types of shall we say again characteristic electromagnetic frequency and therefore in some sense our analogies to the gateways that you refer to in your physical body as chakra but again will be quite arbitrary in labeling or comparing them and you will find many overlaps many different meanings so simply gravitate toward what works for you and use that and you will also find generally though again it is truly only an external symbol that should you find yourself attracted to a location and go there you will in general create an alignment again it is still your energy but alignment with the energy of that area which very often will open again certain doors within you so trust the attraction to these areas and allow them to deliver without a rigid definition this is the heart this is the throat this is the solar plexus of intention and so on and so forth you can do this but the more open you are the more you will find that each area overlaps and contains more than simply one discrete energy um a specific question related to that i have a branch who does dissipate her energy through her body you all do by the way she's definitely not unfortunately painful way but um that is a resistance not the allowance of the flow through the body for all pain mental physical spiritual pain is always the cause of resisting your natural flow resisting your existence perhaps assuming that you must resist that energy and in simply breathing deeply all the way in all the way out even as few as brief eyes can allow the relaxation and open posture to allow the circuit flow of that energy establishing a connection with the spiritual establishing a connection with the quote unquote heaven but maintaining your feet firmly on the ground grounding that circuit and allowing with no resistance that energy through this simple very simple shift in perspective can change the entire experience so simply share that with your friend if you are so inclined at this time we will pause for a short break of 10 to 15 of your minutes of counting and resume contact at that time
