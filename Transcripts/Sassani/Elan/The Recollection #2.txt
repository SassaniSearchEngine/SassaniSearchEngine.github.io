 Oh, I don't say continue Shutting Over there in a mail Uh, Ilana, I contacted a belief of mine earlier in this session Well, congratulations Thank you It was in the form of a judgment that I had It listened to one of the other participants here describing her connection with the future self and her experience on a mother's shift And catching myself with this belief or judgment that that is all well and good But we need to get down to brass tacks and the essential things to do with the planet here Now, do you understand that that may be that particular individual's way of doing so? Yes, but do you propose these? Well, I see this as a constricting self, as a constrictionist side, as a judgment Which I perceive now as one of the things that I've utilized to close doors for myself And constriction in a sense would be the byproduct of the cutting off of that aspect of yourself Or you are that individual and in judging that you are judging that portion of your own self So yes, the restriction does not lie externally, but is experienced as an internal Yes Well, having recognized this is my internal restriction And wishing to reclaim this part of myself presently I feel compelled, I want to investigate my connection with a brother that I had when I was growing up Oh, what? Do you say? Well, my sensing of my world growing up, he was a year younger than me and he lived so about three and a half years of age And my strength of being in the world to the point that this living was just magic Of the sun being bright and the world being full of life This child was quite extraordinary in his delight in life He was bouncing and bubbly and just spontaneous and full of just unconditional love Which I am in proximity reclaiming into my life presently Oh, what? How long will it take? For as you maintain it outside of you as a separation, as we have shared You will create the corresponding time to give you enough time to step toward it But should you simply decide you are that idea Then there will be no necessity for the creation of time to experience it And you simply will reclaim, will recollect that portion of you Again, in your society it is the tendency to view external beings as being separate from you You are in a world with them But more literally seeking they are you And now that you know that, you cannot truly lose anything You can choose to not be in proximity with it, but because it is who you are There is nowhere to put that either So now you give yourself the opportunity by first recognizing and acknowledging how you are limiting yourself with certain beliefs The opportunity to reclaim or recollect his, shall we say, symbol within you All right, my assessing in coming into connection with the ideas that you presented And which I would be again to assimilate over the past months That this same lightness and sense of magic of the world is coming back into my life And that I am feeling a renewal of how it was for me as a child And learning in fact that it was a choice, albeit perhaps ill-advised To cut yourself off from that to begin with Not something that was imposed Again, when you do not know it is a choice, it seems like it happened to you But now that you are reclaiming that life occurs through you and again understanding That you cannot lose anything simply allowing to change its shape You can now utilize that symbol in a positive way as it is relevant to provide strength for yourself Now, right here and ground it as you have shared Therefore, how will you now express this reclaimed portion of your joy and ecstasy? Well, I am not planning anything I think I don't just allow myself to celebrate it in the moment as I go through my days now Hopefully There is quite a lot of gifts that have a sense of coming into my life And I will open them one by one by one Well, you know that from our perspective that answer will be just fine Alright, I did have a question, was my younger brother connected to your society Or does he have a connection with your society? Loosely in that we are able to perceive that style of consciousness more readily For it approximates more our own as we have shared You can only experience a reality you are the vibration of So we only experience when interacting with your society the positive outcome The positive experience And perhaps you can say individuals that choose to live that way And again, this is colloquial as an analogy but shine that much more brightly within our vision We can find them so to speak more readily But this applies to all of you, all we would not be having this conversation They are so therefore in spirit, in attitude But not necessarily a direct linear connection For in that sense he has served as guide for you in this life from behind the scenes And that was one of shall we say the agreements between you And by acknowledging what you are sharing with me now You are fulfilling one of the major purposes of that particular agreement Oh thank you Does that make sense however? Yes That's a good time Alright, that is how we should so to speak Yeah, sure you will Yes Thank you And Sure, you're right Thank you Thank you Thank you Hi, I'm Kim with our teacher Welcome, congratulations I have, I met a little boy that was coming to my class in the past week It's huge And he has a very rare disease Where his body is literally evaluating his self And his name is Brian And I wanted to ask about theachronistic significance of this coming to me as a student at this time Well again, it will be a reflection of your ability to be responsible to him by Responsibly being who you are or being responsible for yourself Without needing to be responsible for his choices But allowing you to be responsible to him by allowing him the option of what you have to offer I also got the sense for me and his mother that not only is significant for me to meet his child and what he's going through But the example of how his mother has made the decision to put him into school Although if he caught measles or sugar pack if you kill him But she's made the decision to not know what's going to happen with him Bring him into as normal of a child's life as she can help him create And I was so impressed with her and I realized when I met her that one, two, three years ago I would have been terrified of what her experiences When with a child you reassert their differences They manifest those differences, shall we say that much more blatantly When you are able in that sense to reassert the similarity You allow them to unfold into that as well Now not to make you all clones, you will still have individuality But the idea is that many times with these particular scenarios factors into the relationship How the child is treated, if they are treated as they are ill they fulfill that prophecy So therefore your particular approach that will assist that individual is that he is just as empowered And even if his choice should be to only live a life for so long That choice is an example of his power And the quality of the time that you spend together is up to you I had one other question, another student that came to the class of student that has been made Thought about being autistic for child Now the same answer will very strongly apply For you will find that segment of your population in particular To get in response to their particular choice A very typical type of treatment and a very typical type of, shall we say, attitude toward them That reinforces the limiting aspects rather than what they have chosen to focus on At the cost of the general, shall we say, focus, mass focus I don't really have any other questions about it, I just thought it was very significant to me That I'm getting these sweet amounts Well that's the only time that you can make a difference And self-empowerment is a difference to the general approach in these matters So you can have a profound effect in this situation Now not that you need to put a burden on yourself that you must But in the being of who you are, there can't by coincidence Incidents is occurring at the same time V.A. profound transference of empowerment Which will strongly raise the quality rather than the quantity of the life And we thank you for your willingness to extend yourself in such a way And again remind you that you cannot be responsible for their decision But can derive great joy in being responsible to them in having made such a decision That acknowledges your willingness to interact with in that way Acknowledges their choice as just as that as yours We thank you, amen, amen. Yes, hi, Allah. Greetings Well, I guess it's about memory Well, may I ask you, is it about memory or are you only guessing? Well, it's about memory and other things too Oh, what were we talking about? Yeah, I know. I know. I know. Are you having a good time? I'm sorry. Come on. Well, can you have a very vivid memory of their childhood? Well, often you will find these to not be direct representations of what did occur But shall we say, updated representations to be consistent with who they are now But we understand that this seems and is presented as they vivid exact memory But do proceed. Well, nevertheless, they are memory of some sort. Anyway, I happen to be one of the people who have little to no memory of their childhood And up until now, I kind of said, well, it's because it's not relevant to who I am right now I'm not the same person who I was then, I'm changing so it's not relevant to my life now So I don't need to remember it Or sometimes I've lost a second that well, maybe I wasn't totally conscious Of the same consciousness that I am of now So I actually was a different person Well, you are always a different person in every moment But perhaps in this instance, part one of your summation would be more appropriate It simply is that those particular instances are not relevant to what you are exploring now And in a sense, your seeming quote unquote inability to recall them is to your advantage Okay, yeah, basically that was the third part of the question and that Well, did not mean to jump ahead but don't Am I filing things away or putting in a closet that was difficult to deal with? I mean, is that a possibility? Well, understand that to some degree, yes, but understand also that you are now allowing them to come up and facing them as they do And this is what will accelerate the integration of you but also, and again, we remind you, these are not bottomless battles You are finite beings and these closets are finite Therefore, as you empty it out, a bit of the time and integrate what you had formally denied There is an end in sight to the quote unquote process that you seem to create How do you know when you get caught up when you're not in your own closet? Because, you know, I thought I'd come to the end of a lot of it and I was fine for a few months And then all of a sudden some stuff started coming back up and When you quote unquote to use your term hit, bottom, or perhaps you can say your battle is empty You simply will no longer have the tendency to interpret anything in a negative way Much as you perceive I do when interacting with you For no matter what anyone shares with us, anyone from your society, we never interpret it in a negative way And can always, shall we say, provide a positive alternative viewpoint And such will be the perspective of you as you allow that to integrate within it That would be nice, yeah Well, okay, but if you say it will be, you put it all If you say that is wonderful right now, then even the quote unquote process of these ideas Coming from the closet can be part of the joy, because your willingness to redefine them And then have them immediately have a new positive effect Is in and of itself very exciting, in and of itself very energizing So if you simply decide you are that you right now, there is no lengthy process And it will simply be automatic processing So when you have a negative interpretation Simply look at this is a neutral set of props with no built in meaning I am obviously assigning it a negative meaning Alright, so what? I have done that, I am noticing it, and I will use it Now, and we assume there will be a particular situation in place With very particular parameters, what must I believe in this situation to be having this negative interpretation Oh, I believe that Oh, thank goodness I found that out I couldn't change it unless I owned it And that is the joyful process of transformation Now that I have equalized it and acknowledged it and thank it for it has led me to this recognition What is the belief I wish to have? Alright, I will see, that belief I will feel what it feels like to have that belief While I feel that my imagination is stoked, as you say Therefore, how am I now acting with this new belief? Well, look at that I am doing something far different than I would do in the situation I was about to enter Oh, joy, a new option, I am this me Oh, joy That simple Can you do that? Yeah May I rephrase that, you can do that, will you? Yeah, I just want to ask one other thing Oh Is this the belief only, are there... I think there is a current sense of that, you have to look at it Now, one belief is that there are specific occurrences that you need, look at But that is only a belief Ultimately, foundationally speaking, it oiled, oiled down to the belief system And when you change that and act as though you have changed And get the reflection of what has changed Any other thing that would behoove you to look at That is relevant to the new you in that situation Will simply be obvious, and you will simply look at it And you will simply move on So I was really, Joan, how'd you go back, don't have to look back at anything Or remember anything because I can just tell her what the belief is going on now No, and interestingly enough, as you allow them to come to the surface Many times, once acknowledged, not before They are nebulous and slippery before you acknowledge them But once acknowledged, and it is not uncommon to have what you call a flash recognition of a particular past For once you acknowledge the belief, there may be The presenting to your consciousness of a particular scenario That is perceived was the cause of the installation of that belief But whether or not that happens, you will get the same effect By acknowledging it, thanking it, and choosing the new belief But there is no way down process necessarily It is simply automatic once you have decided to be that you Does that make sense? Yeah, perfect. Can you use that? Yeah, thank you. Oh, thank you. Well, I'm glad you're on. Mail back there. I have a few questions. Once we're a friend, it deals with July 26th We were on our way up to a state New York It was supposed to be a four hour ride It took us six, because we kept getting lost And she would like to know what is the significance of writing all over New York Perhaps you can say it was an elaborate example To provide to yourself that nothing is extraneous And in judging that something is extraneous You place your attention upon the negative aspect of what you perceive to be extraneous And can literally then perpetuate and prolong it Are you to simply say, alright, this has a reason what does this mean to me and use it in the moment In general, you will then find the correct turn as an analogy Does that make sense to you? So what? Because I have my own answer for this. Well, will you share it with me? Sure, I will. This lady is, you may ask the point where she's realized that she wants to live her life for herself to serve for her husband And I've only known her in that aspect And this long drive, we got to know each other Oh, why? Something we have never done, we've known each other for quite a few years Now, when you shared that with her as a reason, what did she say? Yeah, I don't know. I need to just do that. Oh, I'm sure so. And that is not her reason, yes. But again, you may, in that sense, point her to thinking why she believed that it was extraneous Why she believed something was happening to her from somewhere else I didn't think I was the idea of it. I thought it was just, she was wondering why it was statements along And why we kept making wrong terms Or I kept making wrong terms, because I was driving You will find the frustration that you are speaking of is again, in assuming that something is extraneous And that what is happening in the moment is not exactly that which will serve you Oh, okay. So now you have two ideas to discuss it. Great. Thanks. Oh, thank you. The second one. I've been noticing lately when I've been falling, just for you to fall asleep I'm hearing the phone ringing even though it actually isn't. It rings once and that's all I hear. Is somebody calling? I... Can I ask who? You can ask. Okay, I'm asking. Oh, why? That's sharing. Oh, why? That's sharing. No, no, no. You're not mean to hang on cliff. So find it. Tell everyone. When you pick the phone up, say who is there. Then tell me. Oh, you sound a little nervous? Oh, no. I'm excited. Oh, why? Then boldly accept the call. Hello. We assume you did not just hear it rings. Oh, no, no. But as you say, and I am using your slang purposely, a good try. I'm in the right direction. Thank you. And we thank you for enlightening up. For that is, shall we say, the particular open response that will allow for the placing of the phone call without the reversal of the charges. This is lovely. Thank you. Thank you. Shut your mouth. See you later. Yes, thank you. In September of 1989, I large triangular craft gold in my house. We are underneath it. But I know you. I love you, etc., etc. I've never seen that thing before to my knowledge. I'll go if you say so. Yes. It's my conscious knowledge. Now, recently, I've been having the vacations at night. Now, before you proceed, can you describe what you would proceed to be the bottom of the craft? It was dark gray. It had red lights on me. It was an equilateral triangle. It was about as big as a shopping center. It had blue, white, red, and green lights. And it had a response to me and that I said, if you can hear me blink your life, it's a link to life. I walk underneath it and I said, oh, I know you're the same one that knows Whitley's driver. I mean, I was like three-four and I don't know where the sun is coming from. Well, by the way, in that particular instance, it may not have been the same race, but it's a new proceed. Okay, great. So, then I ran across the road and everybody was swimming. Come back, Linda, you're gonna be mom. And I have a psychic impression that it was gonna be somewhere, so my daughter and I got in the car. We went up the road a couple months and took a lap and it was behind the pass, and I thought going off to a mountain mall hawk. And then I had some strange, what I consider strange phenomena. like a blue crown ball on my dresser in the middle of the night. And I'll say some, I kept using a card chugnet, it's not because that's how to book the song. And I'm like, we'll lighten it, and it rang like a song. So I'll stop, help me. So, excuse me, you, and then before the inter-writing will go down, have we heard such an analogy? And how creative. Ah! I'm never going to understand. And where I got to the nail, you found my end. Well, do understand that from my end, they are laughing with you about this. Thank you very much. Now, I can do so, or I will break the link. I'm sure you're way drawn, I wish. Awwww! I love you for that. Now, can I ask the second question? May I? Um... There's an entity that comes in my bedroom at night, and it's a home board. Um... I'm gonna feel... Pardon? Rosie. Okay. The entity comes to room, oh Lord, I said not one. Oh my God! Oh my God! Good to see you. Um... Is that from the same craft? Describe. The entity... Alright. Is it nail? Good. See, I like nail. Alright. The box in the tie. Um... I don't know if someone was on my stomach, and it's been back in me. Oh, I know. You perceive that individual to be not like... No! No, it has solidity. Oh my God! Ooh! Um... Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Now, understand, from again our perspective, what you are perceiving as the energy is, shall we say slightly different from the craft sighting that you have. They are too, shall we say, different ideas altogether. From our perspective, the craft that you have perceived would in that sense correspond to a slightly larger research vessel from our society. In terms of the other visitations, I will simply invite you to turn over on your back next time and ask. I would like to do that. Then, go right in. All right. Do I know this being from another lifetime or dimension? Well, in a sense, you are, shall we say, very intimately acquainted. I can't. But I will allow you to establish with that entity the connection, and when you are willing to take that next step, that will open up for us a lot to use your slang and have some fun and home-others out of words. Oh, that's okay. Would that have anything to do with the particular blind, I call it the blind time because it looks like Venetian blinds in the air that I see? Is that a stepping process that I am supposed to go through? Is that representational? Even. But turning over and consciously relating and speaking will be the most direct, shall we say, skip of a few steps. All right. Will they allow me to, because they freeze me with an electrical energy? Now, what you are perceiving is, shall we say, a paralysis that results in you forcing yourself to move, simply rather than trying, as you say, to move, allow yourself to move. Like an outer body, maybe? Exactly. Oh, okay. Does that same energy with me when I have an outer body of meat, beans, and? From time to time. Although, again, that will be up to you for that particular frame of consciousness is rather multi-dimensional and can, from that perspective, access many different realities, many different dimensions of experience. Why? What is the purpose with me? Well, what I am sharing is what you would call the astral state itself. Oh, all right. Is it a guide which is considered a guide for you? In the way that you mean no. Did you say God or a guide? Guide. Guide, yes. But even shall we say, more direct than that and by asking you will find out. Okay. Thank you. One more question. Oh. A being or a blight that campers put in my bed and I think I lose astral state, but you spoke to me about loving the most important thing in the whole world and something else. And I forgot the message and I wondered if you could talk to me. Well, I'll go to the ground that you will remember portions of what you perceive to be the direct message. But again, there was the explanation that unconditional love rather than conditional love is the love that they were seeking and also that this applies as strongly to your willingness to unconditionally love yourself. For that is what expands your ability to unconditionally love all others, not the other way around. What's that, an angel? Do you know what an angel is? We understand what you are sharing and simply scanning in our perception in that instance of the glowing being is that that would represent your interpretation of a physicalization and an externalization of your higher self itself. I have some beautiful thoughts there. Oh, my gosh. Who are you? Share some more of the fifth. Oh, yes. One more. I said one more before. When I was 15 years old, or two crafts that came over my house in New Hampshire, and I don't have any memory, I know a lot of little crafts came out. My whole family was involved. Oh, like before you proceed, before we have enough information. These crafts relate more directly with what you are perceiving as your nighttime visitation and are distinctly separate from our triangular craft. Oh, I know them. Oh, so do we. We are in a sense, relatives. Oh, poor, can you tell me their names or anything? In that particular instance, what you would call beings that stem from reticulum society. They have reticulum. The little gray guy? If you wish to call them that. They come in three colors. We're with strivers. We're with them. In a similar arm. But you understand that what you are reading is an interpretation many times through fear. Oh, yeah. Therefore, the more quote unquote negative aspects of what you are experiencing are but interpretation. It is not inherently in any way, shape or form, negative and it is not intended from their end as negative. That rereads me so much because I don't want anything negative. Well, perhaps the emotional detachment from those beings can sometimes be interpreted by your society being that you are rather emotional as indifference. It is not in their form of direct communication and shall we say. One moment. Direct observance. Okay. Thank you very much. Give me a kiss while I'm here. By the way. When you say I must then contain some beautiful thoughts then. Yeah, we again remind you. You can only ever understand or appreciate something at all to begin with if you first contain it. So the moment you see or hear something and say, my, that is beautiful. That is your beauty. You could not proceed or see it or make sense of it. Less you contain within you the analog. So that tells you that you have that within you. Therefore you may rejoice and begin to use that to turn that unconditional love inward for you contain it. Do we have three other children on the planet? We will not comment on the precise number and will for now. And this interaction and the function. It is our joy to interact with all of you dear one. Thank you. Recently I have great privilege to listen to the Hopi elder Thomas Donnianca and to become a spirit brother of sorts with an algonquin she running moose. I learned from Thomas that the Hopi have knocked on the doors of the house of Micah, the United Nations now four times and have not been permitted to speak to the peoples of the earth. Hey, but perhaps this is changing. This is what I was going to ask is the Hopi themselves feel now as if there is only darkness ahead purification and so forth. Now some do but some do not and what perhaps will increase the chances of the interface will be the ones that actually believe in the positive outcome unifying for a singular purpose of world peace. Reunifying re supporting each other not outcasting any individual for being willing to function in that way. The Hopi is the key. I say one they are the Hopi they represent the possibility for peace. Yes, the Hopi means peaceful people and they can in that sense shall we say achieve for lack of better terminology that peace but not by budging and matching what they perceive to be the warring mentality only by maintaining their inner peace and embodying peace. Again, the hating of war is the vibration of war and hate itself. The loving of peace provides an alternative rather than shall we say another self righteous party matching the warring mentality. So therefore their willingness to shine as an example of peace as an alternative living peace will have an effect now in particular because of the transformational tendency within the mass consciousness of your society. This is the time. And they will split the earth whereby one perhaps you can say earth will have the dark and the other that you are all upon will emerge so to speak into the life or at least realize that it had never left the life. I say I say I would. Is it possible that the house of Micah referred to in the proxies is not strictly the United Nations but the physical universe and indeed the Hopi message has been is being heard. Well yes that is in that sense in the suit analogy but perhaps in this case the direct physical analogy will apply for that particular body does represent one of the institutions in place that can allow should things move in a certain direction for a global shall we say co-ordinative body. Yes well one thing that the Hopi do not appear to know now is of the separation that is coming in the positive planet and the other planet. Individuals will generally interpret it as one or the other not realizing that it is both and they get to choose and that should their choice be unconscious through fear which is believing the reality they do not prefer is most likely they will still live shall we say the result of their choice. But you in knowing this can bring many things and will find much openness in that sense and understanding from that particular stream if you approach them in such an unconditionally woman and embodying peace way. Thank you and I would suppose that some of the great earth changes and perhaps most of the great earth changes that are being predicted by a variety of people. Already occurring. Already occurring yes but when the earth separates I would think that the earth is direct at the great positive influence would probably be the one to suffer the most physical damage in the sense. Repeat. There is a split a positive planet with all of its positive influences is being born. There is also a reality that is left behind the status quo planet as it were. In a sense now understand that is not literally the way it is used simply that you are on that positive earth is the perspective that allows you to then embody the attitude that allow you to simply be on that positive earth. So you perceive no split and you only know that you are on the positive earth by drawing the dichotomy you then shall we say open up the possibilities of choosing one or the other. Did that translate this does translate yes well I have some attention on the matter of the other earth whenever it is nature. Hold on. What will happen to this earth to our brother first. Understand for the purposes of convenience we have allowed you to utilize the analogy of the splitting into earth A and B but there are literally an infinite number of splitting earth with every gradation in between. Therefore whatever positive idea you wish in that sense to participate in simply bring that feeling into your now moment. You can have anything from one extreme to the other and any slight gradation in between. Thank you very much. Oh my. And I will take this beautiful message back to the American indigenous peoples. Only our particular message would be to those who have maintained the peaceful frame of mind that you have done so for hundreds of years. You have maintained this aspect of your tribe. You have done so for a reason. Now is the time of awakening. Now is the time of unfoldment. Now is the time for the fulfilling of the peaceful purpose but not by matching the negativity and not by assuming the same tactics as what is perceived to be the negative brother. Therefore maintain the path of the peaceful warrior having that warrior simply being expressed by the sword by the spear by the arrow of your positive conviction for that is what will forge the new earth that is what will make way for the new age of man which is already occurring. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Yes. Oh. I'm surprised. Oh. Thank you for allowing me to speak with you. Oh right. Will you do so a bit louder so that you'll get more? Will not be missed by one. Yes. Thanks. Oh thank you. I have a question. I have two questions about an experience I have recently. A few weeks ago I went to this woman's house who has the lion crystal skull. The big head just skull. And the experience was a little different than what I expected. Well I would sign you. Congratulations. That is the standard reply on our planet for such a statement. Oh not as you expected. Congratulations. New pussy. There seem to be two very different versions of the origin of the skull. One or what I would call a whole group of them is from a book that I read previous to going there and people who were psychic had perceived that just skull had been crystallized using with an actual priestess from Atlantis that was first skull. That is not all. Okay. Another perspective. It was artificially shall we say created by members of your society. Utilizing shall we say lost so to speak technology and created with the purpose of encoding the crystalline structure itself with particular ideas which had occurred. QE is a key but it has upon it a safety valve so to speak. Therefore when looking into its eyes if you are open and not fearful it will reflect back to you certain things which may in that sense unfold over the course of time. But should you in that sense display any fear or hesitation the safety valve in a sense cut that off. Is the safety valve low? Well again the safety valve is just that because it is such a direct and strong mirror that should you in a sense approach it with fear in a sense will turn off. Well in a sense is the key that will integrate fear and allow it to function in it shall we say intended way. Is this purpose then to bring a lot of healing to us at this time? Would that be from your perspective like the encapsulation of it? That may be an effect from unlocking that portion within yourself. But in a sense you can say that it is a storehouse of much information including what you would label to be historical information of not only the Mayan culture but at the Lion King themselves. And if I were to want to tap into that information I would screw time just have that desire within myself. But should you in a sense for a particular symbolic shall we say action wish to access it. You can simply look into what you perceive to be your mirror and with your imagination superimpose the soul upon your own face. Look into its eye ask a particular question and then quiet out listen for the answer. You can more directly access what has been downloaded so to speak into your consciousness in that way direct participation. Thank you. I'm going to do the ask now how do you not be so see you have some fun. I'd like to ask about a second aspect of my experience with it. Your advice want to be very clear and so I had done these medications and a person here came ahead. Worked with me in a healing sense and it was very beautiful. When I went to see the soul I joined with another person and the contact with that person and then leading up to and then that person was with me with the skull for me was emotionally really upsetting and the interaction with that person was very upsetting. And so my initial feeling about the whole thing is that I had failed because I had gotten emotionally involved and was. Now do you understand why you have felt the result of saving to that fail. I think in effect nothing happened. It happened then I can utilize in the sense of utilizing all my creations and my guess is that I was in this situation because in a sense was this person showing me what not to be and maybe what things that I had myself done in the past. Well it is. What was the nature of what you labeled to be the upsetting emotion elicited from you. Okay from my perspective this person was really negative. I thought they were really abusive. They were talking nonstop and invading myself and privacy. They were talking nonstop at which you interpreted and allowed it to be an invasion. Yes. Yes. So perhaps what you are sharing is that in that moment you were not willing to assign that everything was just as it should be that the judgments that arose shall we say resulted in you feeling as though you had not accomplished your goal but understand that when we say you can use your creations this is an ongoing ability. So right now what you are doing is integrating those ideas. Integrating that is all right for him to be that way. It is not however what you prefer therefore you will not be that way and provide an example to individuals such as that of another way to be without insisting that they must be that way. Now that you have integrated this within you you may now simply allow yourself to access the information that you are you listening. And you are now connected in attracting now that you are removing your label of failure and the reason for that label you may now understand that you did not. Thank you very much. Well thank you. I have done nothing. For helping you help me tremendously with understanding those things in the past and right now. Well you have created me to do so and I thank you. I would like others to know that the experience with the skull I believe has helped me to feel the sense of my my beingness and that I think that I am more aware of it and also during the experience itself I have serious sinus infection at the time and physically while I was there it was sending me energy healing energy to my sinuses. Which by the way was a reflection of your own healing energy. Do proceed. All right and then the one thing I noticed about the sinus infection is that when I am emotionally you are going to upset or I am reacting to situations and certain types that I am beginning to see that I get serious headaches and a sinus congestion and pain. And now that you know that you can act rather than react you may breathe easy. Thank you very much. One moment. A suggestion now anything that we ever share with you is only a suggestion. We do not insist that you do it and you will be no less should you choose to do anything. Every option is equal however a suggestion if it is even possible call up that individual and thank him. For that will be the action that will acknowledge that you are using the creation that he has graced you with in a positive way regardless of his intention. And again perhaps that may lead him scratching his head but it will show him an example. A living example alternative. To the you. I would thank them for teaching me. I would like them for reflecting to you who they were and allowing you to make certain decisions about yourself that you have drawn service from interacting with them. Thank you. You want to. I would like to share with you that what you still got in the beginning of this new action is going to be there a lot of questions now but I don't have to ask. Thank you. Do you know what questions are? Yeah. They are answers that you have within you that you place outside of yourself for validation. So in not any longer having the question you are simply willing to be responsible for validating the answers already within you. Thank you. I have a sharing regarding July the twenty six. Oh. I did this suggested and what excited me. I was given a moment and today was rather overcast and hazy and the day of dance rain. And which was not I know that the tuition is driving but coming home it was just the gentlest, finest name that I think I've ever seen and occurred to me in the time that a lot of American Indians tribes are now resort to rain as either male or female and male rain is very hard driving rain and the female rain is the very gentle, nurturing rain. And by the way they are transposable but do proceed. Well I just thought that that was my information and I thought that it was real interesting that they should be graced with this very gentle nursery rain and being that female can also represent these activities as well on that day. But also paradoxically now is the time that you are exploring your male aspect as well for that is the grounding that is the action that is the willingness to assert and again in your language assertion can sometimes be shall we say linked with aggressiveness and obnoxiousness but that need not be the content. There can be a sweet assertion and that is why they are transposable. I have one question regarding timing often when you tell people to pay attention to their dreams over the next three nights of our time. From time to time. And I'm wondering what is the significance of the three nights in their significant time in general interacting with us in your dream reality due to the structuring of what you are able to be the nature of your personality at this time. Will not be remembered so to speak upon waking. So therefore from time to time we will point out particular areas at which we intend to interact with you most blatantly in your dream and by suggesting even the placing of attention upon that, will shall we say increase your likelihood of retaining even the mildest symptoms or symbols of having interacted with us, which would generally be just that, a very small idea or symbol that will have a large usefulness in your mind. Now, do not berate yourself if you did not feel that you had full interaction each night. That is not the nature of what we are sharing, though that is a possibility as well. That's not really the nature of a question. What are you...what is the significance of the three nights that the public consider or five? That is simply shall we say the concentration of the amount of time when interacting in this way that we choose. We also are fond of the number. We find it to be a very stable number, the tripod, the stability, the positive and negative polarity, which shall we say the base of the integration of the two is very stable. One other question, we have continued my conflict on our planet in the area which used to be the global audience. In a previous interaction of the Shahar interaction during the Persian Gulf conflict, the Shahar had said that that conflict was the playing out of residual negativity on our planet and that that location was significant because it had been the location of the occasion and negative consciousness. In a sense. Can you describe a little bit more fully what that infusion of negative consciousness is? Now we will be brief, one of the particulars shall we say systems that we label Orion. In a sense that has had some interaction with your society but not directly with craft. Well that is another story but not in general with craft. It is reincarnation and in general for the reasons of quote unquote escaping the negativity of a particular scenario within their own society. When in that sense reincarnating into your society however shall we say they in that sense brought many of the tendencies they were quote unquote escaping from. Now historically speaking in that area is the coming of the shall we say destructive warrior perhaps you can call him that you have labeled sargon that in a sense historically speaking will represent some of the earliest infusions of Orion consciousness onto your planet and it occur in that particular area which in a sense is symbolic of a sieve of a crucible to allow the concentration of many of these negative ideas to bubble out and in a sense siphon them off from other places on the planet. That is still shall we say a very strongly charged area in this regard and up to your 1997 year perhaps fulminating in that year will be many of these shall we say outbursts of various types. So the conflict in the boffing area is also an onshoot of that? Well in a sense that is more directly related to shall we say demonstrating to your society in no uncertain terms the results of complete intolerance of another population these are issues which are coming to the forefront in your society as we speak and there will be the option to buy into intolerance and exclusion even in your legitimate government but there will also always be the option to begin to release these ideas as outdated and you will see the examples and results of that intolerance so perhaps you can make as you say in your language a sober decision. The reference that is available is the Sargon reference there is not shall we say the juxtaposition of time frame in the channel of this so you can look it up. There will be but a few moments remaining to this interaction. How are you tonight? Oh I'm good. Well look at the word all is right. I want to do is share something that occurred. One moment. As you say in your language you do not miss a trick. I want to share something that happened last night which was kind of intense. Oh right. Do a proceed. Okay basically what happened was we were at a channeling up in Southbury where the places where the vortex and all the miracles will occur and what happened was the channel at one point asked me to channel and this is the second time this occurred and this time when it occurred it didn't occur something very strange was happening the energy didn't feel very right and all everyone in the room felt the same thing in a way that it was negative energy coming through. Now why was that designation rendered? Well I didn't designate that but the feeling that I was hearing a lot of negative energy was in the room and I didn't feel anything. I mean I was just basically presenting what I thought was that there was a ship that was beyond the big ship on the other property. There was another ship and as the ship was coming down I was as I was doing this information it was extremely windy it was absolutely pouring out and as soon as all this stuff ended it seemed as after we went outside everything was calm and my perception was that I'm not quite certain as to why I mean I understand afterwards that was a lesson and I understand that I validate that as it was a lesson and I was chosen to give a lesson and we're all part of the lesson. Well in a sense understand that what is occurring there is many or there are many preconceptions within you many assumptions within you that in that sense you are still not sure about you are on the fence in that sense about. Therefore this results in what you would call perhaps extreme filtration of information that is in that sense being offered to you. So it is our sense not so much that there was a negative shall we say offering for you are not aligned in such a way and if in that sense you are intending and unconditionally lovingly positively presenting it it is impossible for a negative entity to find you. However what you can find are judgments within yourself preconceptions and limitations within yourself that will in that sense color the information many times to perhaps the point where it is no longer at all the information that was transmitted and that is what occurred. So you filtered in that sense the information and therefore now that gives you the opportunity to look at what worked for you and what did not and what beliefs and definitions you still hold within yourself that you are not as I have already shared sure about or have made a decision about. Was there at the beginning felt really clear about the information but then at some point things just did seem right I mean at least terms when you say filtering I understand that but at the near beginning as I was perceiving information it seems as if I had mentioned that there was another ship the ship was coming lower and as it was coming lower as low as it could come the electromagnetic field which it affects was causing all this heavy wind and everything because you it is not our perspective that this is so and in a sense you may understand that in order to shall we say participate in a similar physical reality as you the particular beings you are seeking of would need to lower in a sense physically their frequency or vibration which was interpreted by you as a physical lowering of the craft but they are not that care okay so but obviously what was the weather I mean the weather was absolutely the weather is the result of the emotional body of your math consciousness and having said that perhaps it is quite obvious why there is some tumultuous. The other question I have is that I also was given a message that this miracle is to occur originally was to occur in late October on the property the miracle of the Jesus appearing at the cross on this property now by the way what is your direct perception of what will occur my perception is that I went with myself validation on this and I don't know if that is going to occur but I do believe there will be an occurrence our perception in that there will not be a physical appearance. I agree with that. Now there may be an energy appearance but there is not the necessity to embody that energy in a discrete individual separate from you at this point you are within you now going to express the Christ consciousness through yourself so physically will appear through you each and every one of you there is no shall we say need for the reiteration of that symbol in that way. The reason why that symbol I understand is being presented is for those who aren't aware of that Christ consciousness without the correct. It is unlikely that they would perceive an external physical symbol. Another thing we got last night was that there is going to be the mother Mary who communicated to this woman Henrietta and Henrietta told us to use the channel as the place that there is going to be the mother Mary said it is going to be some sort of occurrence or catastrophe and earthquake occurring a very large disaster on the west coast soon. I was curious about that. Now again there is some likelihood of this and we have shared as may of your next year as the possibility. But understand that such a thing can occur with minimal loss of life. The question here is not what will occur but how will you as a society diffuse it so it need not be so concentrated in one particular area. You are each bow siphons funnels for the energy of your planet and can therefore through your mentality through your consciousness through your beliefs emotions and thoughts begin to siphon and diffuse this energy so that there will not be the necessity of such a concentration of it in one physical location. But from now till then it is our perception that there is possibility of shall we say some shaking up but again the effects of that and the intensity of that is up to your society. Many people invest heavily in the occurrence of what you label the big one. Also I wanted to ask you if there was that night. By the way before we you proceed and those who do not wish it very often will draw it by fearing that it will happen which is the same as saying something I do not prefer. This earthquake is inevitable. Where they now have shall we say some time to look at if they believe that and then by acknowledging it then have the chance to change it should they choose. I was going to say last night when it seemed like it was a lot of energy. We went out to some coffee later on and it was my sensitivity that there were some ships in the area not visible but they were. Now again we have discussed this with you ships in that sense when they are there will be visible. If they are not visible you may simply assume they are not there or they have no reason if you cannot see them to be in your awareness in that way. They do not have a tendency in that sense to hide behind clouds. Now again this is not impossible it is simply extremely rare and when in a sense you will proceed what you sometimes call lenticular cloud formation. It will sometimes be representative of craft behind but often also can simply be representative of a doorway through which craft has passed and then shall we say the particular attraction of that doorway will result in particular shall we say atmospheric formation. Well there were actual lights and there were three lights as we were looking at the sky few of us and there were two exactly away from it and the way the symbolism it looked like the ship the symbolism there were three distinct lights. Now were they moving or stationary? They were stationary but to me that didn't mean anything. Do you understand that many times individuals will shall we say misinterpret star formations as craft? Alright these were towards the northeastern part of the sky and it was exactly just screaming like exactly away from each other and the ones that were just going horizontal were at equal points. I was curious about that. Realize the following. We do not know everything. We do not track in that sense all craft we do not track in that sense all debris. From our understanding there was not that activity at that time. But again we are not the end of the story. So we simply share with you our understanding and our perception without invalidating your home. And one final question for you. There is a place that I went to when on a trail there is a place up in northwest part of the state where it used to be an old military base or whatever silos and it has been closed since then. By the way do answer your question before you ask it and then you may continue to ask it if you wish. It is not likely. Now do proceed for those who perhaps wish to give a question. Well let me question. Okay basically the question was. Are there underground bases? Any answers? No. Not likely. Not likely. Different than that. Well okay well you say well obviously there is a lot of sightings up there of craft. There are also many misidentifications. Understand that a large portion of what you consider to be UFO phenomenology what we consider eye at both phenomenology are misidentifications. Due to projection due to distance due to the relative motions of body involved. Any phenomenon that may appear as sudden accelerations, sudden decelerations can simply be a different direction orientation shall we say clouded in a sense by vast distances. For movement is very relative as you move away from an object. So allow us to start out saying that. Now there are shall we say the rest which are our craft. But there are more I admit identifications than actual identifications of our craft. Okay the ones that are not misidentifications whether that percentage may be. Why is that particular area having that particular type of activity versus any other part of the state. And on this area where the land is is there any entrance to an underground base whether it be of extraterrestrial or terrestrial or I mean we didn't cover the whole land that is up there. But we did walk around and I had a preconceived notion of buildings that were not there and they did a pretty good job of just making certain that nobody would ever find anything that seems. Our perception is that there is shall we say perhaps you can say increased activity in that particular area. And again this leads to then identification of our craft and also misidentification. The reasons will generally be because of certain observations being made that at this time we cannot be that specific about it. Okay thank you very much. And we thank you as well for your ongoing willingness to unfold what you are exploring in terms of the many civilizations that exist throughout the multiverse. At this timing allow me to once again express to you all my and our unconditional love and appreciation for your willingness to continue to open up the doors that you consider to partition your consciousness. You are one whole unbroken homogenous consciousness even if you express that wholeness in fragments therefore it will be your option at any given time to decide simply because you say so. Simply because you desire it simply because it is who you wish to be to shall we say recollect those fragments and allow them to integrate into you in the form of acceptance, acknowledgement, appreciation, utilization and transformation of the things you do not prefer which results in the integration and expression of yourself as one unbroken consciousness. We bid you a most fond and loving good evening and say pleasant dreams.
