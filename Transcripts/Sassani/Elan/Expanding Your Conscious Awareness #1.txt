 All right, I'll say greetings to you this evening of your time as you create time to exist. I will not ask you how you are. For I know you are perfect reflection of whatever it is you are exploring in each and every moment that you create as separate moments of your experience. Allow me to begin with a congratulations for you are all at a personal as well as a collective threshold, a threshold for the acceleration of your awareness of the acceleration of your conscious awareness. Allow me to entitle this interaction expanding your conscious awareness and allow me to begin with the following ideas. Expansion would seem to denote becoming larger, growing as it were. But I remind you that fundamentally speaking you are all infinite, eternal being, multi-dimensional, infinite and eternal. Therefore you are already fundamentally speaking everything there is to be. You are in what you call your human state or your human state of being exploring a type of perhaps you can say amnesia of much of what you know much of what you are but you do so for a reason. That reason is to explore the idea of discovery, to explore the idea of learning, to explore the idea of experiencing things as if anew, experiencing things as if it were the first time. When you are expressing yourself from your infinite and eternal viewpoint there is no time, there is no linear experience, there is no before, during and after, first, second and third. So there is not so to speak as a distinct and discrete experience the idea of experiencing things new for everything already exists within you. Therefore the primary reason for the creation of this life, the primary reason for the creation of this particular human experience is to allow yourself to experience things as if they are new, as if they are unexpected, a surprise. And to do this perhaps you can say you go to great lengths, those lengths are your lives, those lengths are what you consider to be your finite personality, your distinct, discrete persona. Therefore more accurately though you will experience expansion as a growth, as a learning process, as a becoming. Actually expanding is really simply being more of what you already are. It can be perceived as a growth, it can be perceived as learning. But it is truly being more of yourself. Therefore each experience that you have and each realization that you have from any experience that you create expands your knowledge of who you are, what you are and what it is you are exploring. When we speak of conscious awareness, we speak of expanding your attention span so to speak to allowing yourself to be more of who you are on purpose, consciously because you say so because now is the time that you are ready to begin to experience yourself more fully. As you begin to expand through this threshold of being more aware that you do actually have something to do with the creation of your reality, you still get to experience yourself as learning. You still get the sensation of growth, the sensation of becoming more. But truly it is simply being more. You do not actually become anything because again fundamentally you already are everything. What you increase is your conscious awareness of who you are, of what you are, of why you are, of where you are. Or as you begin to expand your conscious awareness, you begin to do things more purposefully. You begin to do things more according to intention, according to preference, which is what many of you say you are desire and therefore you now begin to attract any resource, any seeming external source of the information that you already contain to allow you to see and be more of who you are consciously rather than stuff simply happening as you sometimes say though I am paraphrasing. You can begin to be aware of your participation and aware of your role and aware of your purpose in creating but only first by making the decision to do so. In order to begin to be consciously aware on purpose of who and what you are, you must decide to do so. As a brief review, the way that you create your reality generally and there are many different ways to describe this, we simply are utilizing perhaps you can say the simplest of terms to be the most distinct, to be the simplest, to allow access to what we are saying. But the three steps are the decision deciding who you are in the moment, trusting that decision by placing emphasis upon it by deciding to accept your decision, so to speak, and by acting as though you trust the decision, decision, trust and action. This is a template for how you create your reality. You decide this is who I am, you trust this is who I am because I decided it and you act according to that trust, according to that decision and do not act in any other way that is inconsistent with the trust and decision you have made. This is a way to consciously create your reality, so therefore beginning to desire knowing more of yourself, being more of your great self also would start with the decision I decide to expand my conscious awareness. I decide I wish to allow myself to access more of who and what I am, my power, my ability to allow my life to unfold joyously, effortlessly, because I say so because I deserve it. This is a decision that we invite you to make for all it takes once you decide to make that decision is to trust that the decision is made and now that the decision is made you can only get the results of that decision and ultimately the strongest feedback, the strongest evidence to the universe, which is by the way you that you have trusted this decision is what you call your actions. Or you have a saying actions speak louder than words, actions actually represent in any given moment the ultimate expression in physical terms of a particular decision and trust of a particular belief that you have decided to express. So actions not only speak louder than words, actions prove who you are in the moment. Therefore when you decide to expand your awareness the form that trusting that decision takes is to begin to trust anything that is occurring in your life as being consistent with that decision and not contrary to it. Therefore once you decide who you are, who you wish to be, who you will not settle anything less than being. All you need to do is to trust that no matter what happens it is still consistent with that decision and if you really trust it truly trust it not just say I trust it but really trust your decision then your actions are according to the decision, to the trust and the decision. So if you decide I live my life effortlessly, joyously and you trust that decision and a circumstance comes along that perhaps you would have formally labeled uh oh this is going to be trouble. It is alright to entertain the notion uh oh this is going to be trouble but that interpretation is an interpretation from trusting in an old decision. If you remind yourself one moment I have decided to live my life joyously and effortlessly and I trust that decision you will immediately realize that nothing can be trouble, nothing. Now the thing may be quite unexpected and it may look on the surface to have some built in meaning that runs contrary to the decision but that is only an appearances. If you maintain your resolve if you maintain your decision of who you are if you remind yourself, remind yourself of your decision you can interpret any situation through the understanding of your decision. So therefore uh oh this is trouble can be redefined, can be reinterpreted as well nothing is trouble for I have decided joyous and effortless creation. However this is unexpected. Now I need in this situation to perform an action. So therefore I will be mindful now that I have re-minded myself to act in accordance with my decision which will allow you to immediately take a breath and relax for effortless and joyous was part of that decision and allow you to insert a pause rather than simply acting according to the old decision the old belief the non-preferred limited thinking. Therefore nothing, nothing is extraneous in your surrounding, nothing is extraneous in your decision. If you trust in the positive decision to be the person you choose to be your actions in the circumstance ultimately will determine the outcome more than any set of factors that are in place for your actions are what move are the movers of your physical reality they are the physical expression of your beliefs, emotions and thoughts your actions speak the loudest therefore your willingness to trust in any decision that you make may at first take the form of reminding yourself of realigning yourself back to the decision that you have made of who you choose to be but it need not be a mysterious lengthy and complicated process it can simply be reminding yourself oh yeah I am a joyous effortless person who creates his reality in love in life with a positive result and as fascinating a creator as I am this situation allows me to see that I am this person no matter what happens nothing can talk me out of it and perhaps it will be a challenge to rise to the occasion or at least seem like a challenge for a moment but yes even in this circumstance I can do it because this is who I am I will not settle for any less than who I am decision trust and action this and allowing yourself to be aware of this is conscious awareness being consciously aware of the decision of who you are being consciously aware of your surroundings as being supportive to that decision no matter what is happening and being consciously aware of what you will do about it is all it takes to transform the faith of your life 100% if that is what you choose to do now I am not assuming that everyone is unhappy with their circumstance and in general in the way that I perceive that many of you create your reality you do create joy you do create happiness you do create preference so you already use this system that we are speaking of however generally your reality is a mixed bag and it is not a mixed bag due to using this system of maintaining your conscious awareness of who you are where and what you are doing and what you will do about it the mixed bag is a result of abandoning that approach due to what you call an external circumstance that you assume is evident that your decision is no good basically what I am saying is that where you create what you call distress misery unhappiness is where you abandon the decision of who you are because you allow external circumstances to talk you out of it now I said that very carefully you allow external circumstances to talk you out of it not that external circumstances have any influence or effect upon you until you fall fall into agreement with the external circumstance well I must not be the empowered person because look at the mess I have created however that very statement is not truss that you are the decision of the empowered person it is momentarily allowing yourself to perhaps using your language what you say laps into the decision of disempowerment once again always do you have the choice in any given moment on how you will respond always do you have the choice in any given moment of how you will respond oh he's repeating himself do you think he's doing that for a reason I think so this is your ability your ability to respond in any given moment this is your response ability and this is all that you need to to gauge your response to the positive decision of who you choose to be again I remind you no matter what effect you get you are automatically doing what I am saying in some form you are making a decision trusting in that decision acting according to the trust in that decision those actions create effects create circumstances and those circumstances generally then will reinforce the decision so if the decision is one of disempowerment and you trust in act according to disempowerment those actions will create circumstances will create relationships will create dichotomy that will reinforce disempowerment and therefore allow you to see and say well I knew I was disempowered look however it works the other way around when you decide to be empowered when you decide to create according to preference and you trust and then act accordingly only can those actions reinforce the positive decision perhaps the distinction that we are discussing here is simply being willing to be aware as opposed to simply responding or reacting shall I say that is all conscious awareness is the willingness to make the decision that I will remain aware in what you call your nighttime dream when you fall asleep from time to time individuals will experience what you refer to as lucid dreaming where you wake up so to speak in the dream and realize you are dreaming and realize therefore that the reality exists within you in that dream and therefore you can affect the reality quite directly because it is all you're doing generally when you experience what you call lucid dreaming of this type in your waking dream what you call your life you will be entertaining many of the notions we are discussing for when in a given moment you are willing to be consciously aware of your decision to act as the creator of your own reality you are waking up in this dream in this waking dream you are experiencing moments of what you would call lucidity in your life you will express to us that they enjoy lucid nighttime dreaming so what I am suggesting to you is that as you are willing to be lucid in your daytime waking dream in this reality that you call your life you will find a similar result you will understand that the reality exists within you you will understand that you have direct influence on the outcome of your events and you will understand that you have created the situation for a reason created the situation to experience yourself more of your great self therefore I thank you for attracting me to share with you more of who you are more of who you have already become and are willing to be you have a saying in your society that when you are ready for a particular idea or a particular portion to explore within yourself the teacher will come the paradox is that you ultimately are the teacher though you will seem to attract external sources individual resources informational basis databases if you will it is all merely a reflection of you so invite yourself to be more of your self and that decision will yield external reflection seemingly external you create the separation of experiencing yourself as a separate being to allow yourself to see what it would be like to be in a reality in actuality the reality is within you but you allow yourself to explore being within a reality therefore you create an apparent see I am here reality is out there out there however is all still inside of you is all a reflection of you when you are willing to decide to be consciously aware of your decision to create and experience this reality there are many benefits there are many unique advantages to this particular experience you can have fun with your external reflection allowing yourself to make internal decisions trust in those decisions act according to the trust in those decisions then allows you to sit back and experience the results of those decisions the external reflection through the internal decision all of which again still exists within you but you get to play the game of being within a reality often individuals will not perceive it as a game they will perceive it as a jail that is one way to look at it obviously you can provide as much evidence and support of this as you wish but as I am speaking the words that I am saying may just ring true in terms of it being a unique experience in terms of it having a purpose in terms of you having a direct responsibility in being here and in how you create the quality of the experience that is your life in return for your willingness to allow me to reflect to you what you already know on some level and are now willing to be I thank you for me it is a great honor to simply be a mirror a reflection of who you already are to you in my particular reality we live this way as a matter of course as a matter of our approach so therefore it is easy for me to speak of this of course utilizing the convention you call channeling for I do not speak or language because I live this way therefore I am perhaps you can say a bit experienced in this department but I do not parade this experience for your approval I will leave that up to your sense of discernment I simply share it with you to explain why it comes so easily to me anything that I say that you embrace that you understand that makes sense to you allows you to know in no uncertain terms that you already contain it if you do not already contain something it will simply make no sense to you there is nowhere to file it it does not fit into your definition of who you are so any information that you derive from any source including our source is simply an outer reflection of your readiness to embrace more of yourself therefore give yourself the credit that is where the credit is due in return for your willingness to allow me to act in such a fashion and to also provide me with what you call many hours of great joy in your presence I thank you and I ask you how I may be of service to you and you may be of service to me through what we call the sharing sharing hey my previous interaction of someone said they were reading an article and they heard your voice as they were reading the article well so to speak yes and they asked if you would assist them from time to time now you mentioned at that time that you do not monitor us because you have your own life and your own business to be about however when you sense that someone requires your assistance or some feedback you dispatch such and just trust that it falls into the proper time slot for that person to experience it in a timely manner could you could you elucidate on the mechanics involved in that very simple one of the decisions I have made and I will make this quite colloquial to fit into the confines of what you call this conversation is that in each and every moment I know what I need to know when I need to know it no exceptions therefore no matter what I know in any given moment I trust it implicitly if there is something I do not know I trust that as much so therefore when I am interacting with any individual and this is true for all of you not just me I simply express it consciously I trust that I attracted myself to that situation that what I uniquely have to offer will be of service no matter what the other individual makes of it I trust that they have attracted what they have attracted for reasons and I simply allow myself to be most fully who I am knowing what I know in that moment and that is the extent of my involvement now is that too simple no it's not no that address the point yes it does now are you willing to do the same yes I am are you willing to trust yourself to the degree that any situation that you are in and any individuals that you find yourself interacting to and with is exactly perfect and therefore your opinion in that moment even if it may seem to run contrary to the opinion of the other is essential it is the reason that you are in that circumstance not to change their opinion change their mind but simply to offer who you are because you are there to offer it are you willing to that extent yes oh my is there anything else yes in terms of creating one's own reality and transforming or allowing to transform in a sense and I mean this symbolically the virgin birth can represent to you the emergence of the Christ within without needing any help without another source without needing our fertilization but simply being the inner sea being the water the light and allowing yourself to birth for that is why I said happy birthday and many times newborn babies are bold this is what is getting leading me to is that a year ago when I had the dream I believe about this information it was given to me as it was my project it has to do with the peace clock I hear now I you know it's coming different streams it's been quite a year almost briefly for those involved since they are here as well describe the peace clock I be put it out there my mind fine why do I need to do that no I can do that I'm just kidding is it something you wish to keep on your mantle or is it something you wish to share with other no absolutely share with others then figure out your chest be boldly and proudly and tell other individuals what you are doing well the peace clock idea the concept is that it's every day at twelve o'clock your time though no matter where you are on the planet you spend take create a minute of your own time to visualize world peace inner peace how you want to see a preferred planet it will actually create pieces of the pie and complete birth and spin earth into fourth empty into a peaceful planet that's my idea that's my vision where can I get one right on so here I am and I'm finally speaking up and saying that I never really spoken to you about this verbally like this anyway and I get them to bring it up because I know where I'm going with it I'm stopping a little bit here and there and I'm trusting that but I've got a big goal and it's like I want to see this thing hanging on the United Nations all right so here I am it's Christmas and I wanted to bring it up and I guess that's where I'm leaving here all right are you taking order now oh why not because I'm working on the prototype oh perhaps you may wish to understand that putting it out there is part of the process in a sense that is how we are playing now what we are doing now what we have done allow individuals to know what you are doing allow individuals to request of you such an idea when you first mentioned it you sounded what you call rather timid rather withdrawn about it because I'm still not sure if I can claim the responsibility of this idea because it's been offered by you now now for one and then I think wait a minute my idea but then I think so what I think I can if it's not your unique application and version of an idea yes that is all in that sense that you need be your version of the idea if you have any doubts as to what you call propriety then pick up what you call your phone and call any individuals and check it out but perhaps what you will find is that it is your timidness it is your unwillingness to put it out that has slowed you down and perhaps simply the process of putting it out there will allow it to accelerate all right right thank you thank you thank you thank you we may help hi well actually my question is about women and I've been looking into the roles of women in our society throughout the century and most of the cultures on this planet have male dominated society and are seeing one of them for the most part I want to know if you can tell us anything about other cultures both on our planet and other planets in which either are female dominated or strictly co-created inequality all right thank you do understand that not all societies all planetary civilizations express what you call analogs to what you call your genders but in the ones that do that we have been aware of there are shall I say a mixed assortment of what you call domination so to speak or predominance and there are also societies that are quite balanced in other words what you call matriarchy do exist in a planetary sense in similar fashion as patriarchy may seem to be pervasive upon your planet within your own history on this planet there have been many instances of what you call matriarchal society and societies that are simply familial that allow the balance of the advantages of both genders to simply be incorporated into an integrated whole structure society but in general as what you have perhaps noticed this would be in what you call tribal sense in certain cultures there are certain cultures although I am not aware of the actual name that exists upon your planet that function in this way now what you will find and what has already happened to a large degree though many individuals are not willing to completely acknowledge it and continue to simply keep themselves in the victimization and distant power viewpoint of insisting that nothing has changed is that a balance is beginning to be reached and as what you call your media allows what you call more of an interglobal linking interglobal communication you will find more of a balance between what you call the races more of a balance between what you refer to as the sex or genders was there something specific you were seeking no that was actually good what can we do to encourage that other than you know on the personal level is there some way of seeing it I think that our views sometimes can be worked how we perceive male and female well that view is the product of a decision the decision can simply be I am a balanced person I happen to be female or I happen to be male therefore I will allow myself to express who I am utilizing that advantage I will utilize the advantages offered by other individuals with different four-day different nuances and I will walk as a living example of balance of a living example of attracting such balance and you will then begin to see what you call the faith so to speak of your society change to echo or reflect that decision you had asked is there anything beside a personal decision not really it begins there and that is not a minor thing that allows you to play take yourself while reality changes around you it is a major causal event that you become integrating your male and female energy on a personal level without referring to well yes but also allowing yourself to express your female in this fully not in order to prove anything to any male not in order in that sense to do anything but use your strength whatever you consider that to be for this will also be quite interpretive certain individuals will interpret female energy to mean one thing others will interpret it to mean another thing from my perspective generally speaking female energy is simply receptivity and male energy is simply assertivity action so you all already display some type of a balance of those two energies within you though you may be physically one gender you can all express a complete 50% 50% balance of those energies within you but should there be particular aspects that are afforded to you by what you call your physical gender that give you an advantage in a situation then you can utilize that as well but again not to prove it to simply use it does that translate I am in that sense intending to remain general well I didn't really understand my part about using I'm not sure what do you perceive to be an advantage of being of the female gender everything I love thinking why perhaps that is why you did not understand what I have said and that allows you to see what I mean as you explore what that means to you and as I have said that will vary from individual to individual you will see certain advantages in it okay so your homework should you decide to accept it is to simply explore your femaleness while expressing a balance of both energy within you now I am only playing there is no homework it is all fun but you can understand that you brought this up to open a door within you now that it is open walk through it if you wish well is that all well it's not I want to add something related to that yeah all right granting the validity of both male and female and then within that structure the decision to have the both be equal on flooring I that's what I meant by expressing the predominance the advantage without needing to prove it to be better or equal assuming when you prove yourself to be equal that you are not perceived as equal if you consider yourself equal it does not matter what anyone else says for instance we have used the sometimes perhaps you can call outlandish example someone walks up to you and says you are green you look in the mirror you are not green you know you are not green but they insist that you are they swear they look sincere they believe it to them you are green but you know for you you are not and therefore what they say may seem interesting may seem fascinating but it doesn't affect you you know who you are no matter what they say it cannot change who you know yourself to be therefore utilizing this example as an analogy and using perhaps again a less absurd example if you know yourself to be equal no matter what anyone else says that does not change your decision to act equal if you allow someone else's opinion to predominate you to the degree with which you enter into agreement with that decision you decide I must not be equal because they say I am not you still have made the decision you still are trusting that you are not equal and believe me your actions will reflect that and then you will get the evidence of inequality so therefore deciding that you are equal the decision though that is just what you call a personal decision is the sea is what allows the reality to pivot around your new decision is that clear yes does that help does that help you oh thank you to go across and describe any type of prejudice or discrimination if you do not buy into anyone else's opinion of yourself because you are too busy knowing who you are then everything else will simply be an interesting theory and need not be the definition of who you are may actually help you to reinforce who you are well I know I'm equal and the more this person tells me I'm not the more I know I am but not with the dynamic of meeting to prove it simply a reinforcement of the decision of who you are no one no matter how persuasive no matter how pervasive can talk you out of who you are only can you fall into decision with what they are saying and talk yourself out of who you are or shall I say shift the decision of who you are I thank you oh you just did another one okay we watched a special within the last week or two on anorexia and eating disorders and we were basically one woman's having a lot of positive results treating these young girls young women who are starving themselves literally to death and she's having good results because she's dealing with their lack of deserve ability and their lack of self love these girls are coming from seemingly loving homes nurturing Karen where is this lack of deserve ability coming from and these girls that is truly what they ask them to do it and me from many sources often and I will not make a general statement or rule about this because it's so very what you are perceiving as a loving and nurturing environment may very well simply be one parent also conditional love can sometimes look who you are or shall I say shift the decision of who you are I thank you oh you just did another one okay we watched a special within the last week or two on anorexia and eating disorders and we were basically one woman's having a lot of positive results treating these young girls young women who are starving themselves literally to death and she's having good results because she's dealing with their lack of deserve ability and their lack of self love these girls are coming from seemingly loving homes nurturing Karen where is this lack of deserve ability coming from and these girls that is truly what the essence of that just go ahead and me from many sources often and I will not make a general statement or rule about this because it's so very what you are perceiving as a loving and nurturing environment may very well simply be one parent also conditional love can sometimes look like nurturing love what allows people to heal or what allows people to agree to heal themselves is not conditionally loving themselves if I do this I will love myself if I do this I think what allows healing what allows the expression of fullness is unconditional love and that is the hub of the issue here the person you are speaking about is willing to display complete 100% on condition along does that answer the question thank you male director of historical perspective of the two pre-mortem races particularly with regards to geographic location maybe time frame or dimensional differences and also were they involved in more of an asexual reproductive capability allow me to ask you what is your current understanding of what you are asking my current understanding is that they were not of our dimension and they were more astral in their projections but if there would be an overlacing on our physical flow where would that location be and what would that time frame be as we know it one more the information you are asking is quite a skew in being synchronized physically with the reality that you consider to be your physical history therefore an answer that I would give you would be quite arbitrary the time frame from my perception in tapping into the intention behind your question would be from approximately 120,000 to approximately 70,000 of your years ago. One more. Since you are speaking of what you would call an admixture prior to some degree to physical incarnation I find this to be a quite nebulous question. Are you seeing poles of the planet? Yes, that will be at once. Of ten to fifteen of your minutes of counting and return for continued contact at that timing.
