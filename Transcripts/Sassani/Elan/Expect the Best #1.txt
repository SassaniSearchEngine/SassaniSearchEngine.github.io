 Greetings this evening of your time as you create time to exist. How are you all? Oh thank you. Allow me to begin this interaction by explaining that very often we find in viewing your society, in interacting with members of your society, that you do sometimes in that sense, shall we say put out to the universe, mixed signals. You are in that sense creators of your own reality as we and many others upon your planet have discussed many times. But understand that one of the things that allows you to be an effective creator is clarity, clarity of your intention, clarity of your vision. Therefore very often individuals will from time to time be nebulous in what it is they wish to do, be vague in what it is they wish to do or in fact contain contrary, contradictory definitions within them that in that sense send out mixed messages to the universe. You may entitle this interaction if you wish, expect the best. One particular example of what we are speaking of was something that we did discuss perhaps as far as you are concerned many months ago with a particular individual and this was the idea of being taught as you are growing up, being ingrained with, presented with, the idea of expecting the best but preparing for the worst just in case. This in that sense is a paradox, is an irony, is self contradictory for the preparation for the worst as you say is in and of itself a statement. And in that sense if that preparation takes the form of action, takes the form of doing something to prepare, that actually puts out more blatantly the message of expecting the worst than expecting the best for if you as a concept expect the worst but your actions reflect expectations of the worst when you are in that sense expecting the best conceptually. Those actions that preparation in and of itself midwives in perhaps again colloquially speaking the worst outcome. Therefore we speak many times about your attitude shaping your reality. It is in that sense only truly a middle person toward doing so for it is the actions that you assume that literally creates the reality that brings it from mentalizing from thought process to reality. We have also discussed recently that while you are mentalizing, seeking, interpreting a situation that before you proceed in action particularly if your interpretation and attitude is negative that you at least provide one other positive alternative before proceeding so at least you have a choice for whatever you act whatever idea you act on as a foundation the actions are what create the reality in this physical set of certain things. So once again you can therefore think anything you wish. You can think I expect the best but what you do determines it so if I in thinking expect the best but in action prepare for the worst that preparation that defense sets up the attack the preparation for the worst is the same as saying I truly believe I will receive the worst outcome and as an reinforcement for the fact that I believe this I will set up a defense I will set up protection just in case. Now understand that that just in case clause is what allows more probability for the negative outcome as we have again shared many times all situations in your life are neutral and have no built in meaning and your assignment of the meaning in a given situation determines the effect you get out. This happens and works in that sense across the board so in preparing for the worst you are assigning the meaning that I expect the worst here is the blatant proof from my actions that I expect the worst I am setting up protection just in case. Or from now on decide if you wish decide what it is that you wish to occur decide if you wish to in that sense be looking out for the best or the worst in any given situation be purposeful about it and if your decision is to expect the best from what is available from what is right there then pay particular attention to your actions and should you find yourself in the performance of those actions setting up preparing just in case. Stop yourself ask yourself what must I believe to be doing this and you will find the overwhelming primary belief is that the worst is yet to come but should you decide that you wish again the most positive outcome from any neutral situation simply use the tool of your imagination to provide an alternative scenario if you are in that sense performing actions expecting and preparing for the worst then those are the actions that an individual who believes in the worst outcome would perform therefore you already have the model for the negative outcome but you are infinite creators with infinite choice therefore you can also use your imagination to project all right now that I see what preparing for the worst is a representation of what the belief is behind that idea now I will give myself that other alternative I will look in that sense before I leave all right what then if I truly believe or if a person if you wish to remove it once from yourself who truly believe in the positive outcome what do I see that person doing in my imagination and then allow that tool to provide your specific self tailored answer then look at those actions they will differ I assured you from the perspective mode the expecting and preparing for the worst mode then you will have two sets of action then you have a choice you will always find that your imagination can always in any given situation provide a set of actions that will be representational of your desired outcome and in fact of your desired self for you already create with this mechanism though very often due to societal and grainy the imagination is geared toward the negative outcome you use your imagination many times to prepare for the worst therefore you already do this already and it is not a matter of building up any strength or exercising or creating a new ability now it is taking that ability you already have and beginning to apply it according to preference according to your integrity according to your excitement according to what it is that you desire simply because you know if you are in your integrity it can only be of service to yourself can only be of service to others so therefore the only reason you need have for choosing a positive perspective is because you say so and that is all that is really all there is to it you get to choose if you automatically make a choice without quote unquote thought or thinking it is still a choice perhaps when you do not provide other options it seems like the only choice but what we are sharing is a very simple way to in view to utilize your imagination in any given situation simply in that situation whatever the situation is be specific to the situation that is right in front of you hand it over to the preferential you in your imagination the referential preferential you and watch what it does before you act you can still act the negative way nothing is being lost or taken from you but most often when you provide a positive alternative that comes from the vibration of who you prefer to be just in giving yourself the benefit of that doubt so to speak you will give yourself a more desirable set of action for if two things are lying in front of you one is an automatic reaction that will obviously yield the negative result and the other is in the same exact neutral situation a set of actions that can only give you at least a different result and because the approach is positive a more positive result it is then not difficult to choose you are then not acting that in that sense on automatic pilot automatic pilot is simply when you feel something acting without fault without evaluation in a sense it has become automatic to do so but understand that when you begin to give yourself the positive choices the referential preferential you you will find that you only do so by effort at first for you are replacing the habitual ritual of simply moving according to negative assignment with a new alternative and you will find that perhaps at first yes you need to go through that set of steps conjuring up the preferred you and handing it over and watching what it does and perhaps rejoicing at the ingenuity within you but you will quickly find if you act on what your imagination provides in this specific way that you will by getting that result also begin to do that automatically therefore no process is truly required simply a changing of perspective a changing of your interpretation and attitude and your willingness to evaluate before you act and it is that simple eventually your preferential you and your imagination will simply be coughing up automatically the actions at first and perhaps you will then need to grow up to even find the negative interpretation attitude and action so it really only takes a slight shift in your perspective but truly this is created by the mere willingness to do so rather than to function on automatic the mere willingness to say there even might be an alternative here I know if what I am about to do if I do it I will have a negative result I know it it happens all the time you may say therefore you can now give yourself the alternative and you do not need in that sense to call me open a book call a friend you can do this and we are not discouraging sharing what you find but what I am saying is that you contain within you everything you need to transform and being that it is eternal and internal you don't need anything outside of yourself you will find that when you are willing to consult your preferential preferential you and your imagination that it will take on a life of itself and gradually though sometimes quickly you will simply find yourself automatically being that you out of preference out of joy out of desire because you say so and perhaps are sick in that sense using your colloquial language of settling for less than who you desire to be you really can expect the best and so to speak prepare for the best much in the way that you used to prepare for the worst is this clear therefore we always in interacting with you expect the best from you and have never one single time been disappointed we are not here to give you something you must have that you are depraved without no in fact we are not even here to really say that you are doing anything wrong no you are who you are you are the creators of your reality we are who we are the creators of our own reality we desire and choose by choice choose to share our perspective because they have worked for us but make no bones about it your perspectives have worked just as well for the end we do however detect that you are now beginning to desire a positive outcome a perfect positive outcome as perhaps opposed to the perfect mixed outcome that you create so therefore what we share with you is not something that you are without you contain what I am sharing and we simply in that sense allow you to see that the seed already exists within you all you need to do in that sense if you wish is add a little bit of water a little bit of light and it will grow automatically but we are not planting anything within you and anything you find as joyful helpful ecstatic that comes from our stream of information only does so and only translates and makes sense to you because you already contain therefore my purpose is simply to share with no insistence involved therefore whenever I am interacting with any individual from your society or the many societies that we interact with I always expect you to be the best you you are the best you that you are now expressing and have never again once in any way been let down though in that sense even if you did not believe in yourself I would still believe in you anyway so therefore I never will be like that you can feel the same way about yourself otherwise you would not even be able to perceive that I feel that way about therefore I thank you for your willingness to begin to explore many avenues begin to knock down in a sense the maze of walls that you create within your consciousness and begin to express yourself as one unbroken continuous whole consciousness which is what you are from our perspective in appreciation for your willingness to look beyond daily life in that sense beyond what your eye can see while still remaining completely involved in it grounded in that sense I asked you now how may I be in sharing in love of service to you and as well allow you all to be of service to us as well Sherry I usually just have one little question but I'm kind of glad that it's all roots nice I have quite a few my first question is you live in the fourth dimension well in a sense perhaps more appropriately would be for density of awareness and as you move up the particular scale we are speaking of which by the way is not a law but an arbitrary designation one is less dense in consciousness so therefore perhaps that would frankly just slightly more expanded well okay here on earth there's I guess it's a law of duality that for each amount of good energy there's an equal amount of negative or dark or bad and I'm wondering if in the fourth density you does that exist well not really in the way that you mean and understand that it only exists in your density because of your own definition you are in a shall we say physical universe that contains the concept or exploration of polarity you will sometimes will break this down to positive and negative therefore in your expansion you will become more aware more expanded but because polarity is one of the explorations in this particular physical universe you will become more aware of both the positive and the negative but here is the key and I very directly into what we discussed at the beginning of this interaction thinking about the negative thinking about the positive has no physical effect perhaps if that's all you think about you can create that as well but the idea is that it is the actions that you perform that actually give you the seemingly positive or negative outcome so therefore you can explore all the negativity you wish you can look at all the issues within you that you wish only when you act with that negative foundational belief do you then get the negative result so by extension what I am saying is this as you expand you will become more aware of both but awareness of and experience of are two entirely different things all together therefore if you act on the positive premise you will only get all 100% positive results where you will express the awareness of the negativity is through others so therefore you still maintain the balance you still maintain the choice of having chosen to be in this reality and experience the parameters of it in terms of awareness but you can literally never again have a negative experience and again because many other individuals do not at the same time believe this will still be aware of the negativity through others but there is a societal definition very often that is presented to many members of your society as you are in that sense growing and that is that you must literally balance out positive experience with negative experience that is a definition and allow me to say when you buy into it we agree with the effect of it in other words when you buy into that you will create that you will create the evidence of that and therefore seem like that the only way but when you begin to adopt as we had shared at the beginning of the interaction the positive actions you no longer need to experience that balance as a retribution you no longer need to create quote unquote and I am quoting now your particular stream of this thought you no longer need to create misery so that you can then appreciate your happiness now that is one way to do it and I wish again to underline that always are valid even that obviously that works so my question is for you in your society I'm getting there but as I was saying you can therefore nullify that effect in your own life and this also extends to what you call karma karma is self-imposed in the way that you experience it sometimes you may call it retribution style or an eye that is only one way to establish balance balance there is balance there will be but if you are open-minded balance can take many forms and you can learn from something that you do that has a negative outcome through positive experience you need not only balance it for instance if you kill someone by being killed an example we use quite often you can in that sense if you have explored murder and in your next life colloquially speaking wish to establish balance yes one way is to be murdered and you can look over your shoulder for the rest of your life if you create it in that way but another way is to be of assistance to someone else about to murder or be of assistance to someone who has had a close relative who has been murdered there are many ways to establish that balance so even that retribution style karma in your society is self-imposed bought into and you need not experience it I for an eye to for two in our society we only all of us 100% of the time experience positive results we only always have a positive expectation and outlook however we are still physical and again one of the parameters of the type of physicality that we also to some degree share in common with you is the existence of the negative polevents therefore our only awareness of negativity is through others your civilization including but we do not experience it directly and do not interpret anything according to that particular line of thinking about that yes thank you I have another question that I think is really interesting this room with all of physical humans here and you can you tell if there are any reincarnated souls of any state or recognize people from our history and if you get in permission to let us know about that well perhaps in that sense I will scan although I will not in that sense have access to a question or answer that may come along a path of less so before I do what is your impression I think there I think that there may be a few people in this room who are reincarnated of recognized people that we know from our history is there anyone in particular that comes to mind well me and feel a strong I will open that for everyone because I think it's a wonderful thing to know and explore well do understand that you have all lived thousands of lives and only perhaps will perceive a few or none many times because of the relevance of what you explored in those lives this life has a particular focus has a particular shall we say point of view therefore the other lives whereby the explorations were similar and would have some usefulness will be the ones you perceive as your only path lines but you have literally each done it all in terms of exploring positive and great negativity in this we got we are receiving no specific referential names however will again ask you what is your perception of your own I am I can say really that I've been trying to live it out and do you in that sense relate to what you call this type of what you call Jesus oh yeah oh that is one of our strongest perceptions in terms of your own involved though more specific than that we will not get it doesn't mean like one of the twelve of us or disciple not necessarily understanding that there were far more than they mentioned twelve well that's all you can get that's all that's all only one of the disciples oh well I guess I don't understand you know the the depth of what having been a disciple of Jesus well I assume we will now explore but the more open-minded that you are the more forthcoming that information will be for it does come along the lines of least resistance and you all have the ability to tap into half life experience by simply closing your eyes taking free deep and loving and centering breath and then simply through your heart feeling what perhaps area of your history most attracts you allow the imagery to flow to cross your awareness you will get a distinct period in history you will get a distinct feeling of your role at this point most individuals say I'm making it up and that is why you lose the connection to this ability but if you are willing to nurture and trust what you get since your imagination could have provided anything why did it provide what it did place significance on what it chose to present to you your imagination is once again a tool as well as a fantasy escape element it is a school and the way that you nurture your relationship to providing information is to trust the information that it provides and act on it any way that you can or any information that you find out is all well and good but the road that it opens up and what it allows you to do is the bottom line or you are physical being in the physical world and it is the actions the doing this that takes any concept and once again midwives it into reality therefore follow your own threat is there something else um thank you on that and I do it just have one more little small line of questioning oh a video scene there will also be an emphasis from this point forward in these interactions though from time to time it may serve purposes to deviate from this concept but to remain as firmly focused in this life as possible thank you I know you you with me specifically you've asked me that or you pointed that out to me because I've asked you about has like been before and should you wonder what can I get from a past life remind yourself that you already have everything you need in this life therefore if you return your focus to this life you will find it thank you I just I have a curiosity and that you know it strictly comes from the curiosity more than that's what I feel more than from you know wanting to know what I learned well we do not believe in what you sometimes call idle curiosity or do us any wondering any curiosity is the sublime expression of your exploration do proceed thank you oh thank you okay um my beloved dog Richard passed away about three and a half weeks ago now what does this allow you to now do it allows me a lot of wonderful things today um oh my name freedom I don't have to go home and walk in tonight if I don't want to um I have no more dog dog hair collecting in my house um and I'm also relieved that she's not ill anymore okay what do you wish to know simply pointing you in the direction of using your creations in a positive way which you obviously have done oh yeah absolutely here's a wonderful pet but just a positive second to um well I'm trying to stay sort of in the now I sort of had some questions about the future but try to stay in the now we're the only time you ever exist you literally need to try to not be here by focusing on a perceived path or a projected future therefore what is right in front of you the moment you act that and look you are back in the moment well I have one question um I always felt that he was incredibly intelligent and extremely highly evolved and we had a very um empathic and passion spiritual connection and um I don't know from I guess from your perspective would that be a valid place but perhaps again your retention would best be placed on the freedom that you have for there are literally things that you can now do not to take anything away from that relationship it served you it provided the mutually exchanging unconditional love but there are things that you can do now that you could not do and that is how to be in the moment about this particular issue okay thank you oh thank you and our unconditional love to you and likewise to me sure good evening three years um I don't know where do I begin samalia a lot is going on for me about the problems in samalia and which situations that they have not allowed to transform are you referring to or there are more than one in that area well particularly the starvation issues which is in that sense directly connected to the other political issues yes um I have a couple questions around this one is um I had asked you before I feel that there's great momentum to my traveling and doing some kind of service work and lately this seems like this is a place where I belong I pursued a few channels that haven't they're not the obvious channels yet and I was wondering yes there is momentum to that and I'm on the right track and can you assist me in like what organizations would support that effort for me personally in terms of the specifics no we do not keep track of the coming and going in that specific way however our suggestion would again simply be to clarify how your excitement fits into this equation you can in that sense be of service without physically in that sense going there is it your perception that it excites you to physically go there yes why why because I feel that I feel that people are needed there to assist and I'm needed there oh that seems quite clear with it what will you find my way to get there oh how do you well I'm not finished then then neither am I the other side of as you said that's not necessarily the only way that I can assist through my business I just recently had a meeting with an organization that's called Save the Children of Local in this time and they provide programs for saving children all over the world and they are working very closely with the Somalia Somalia issue I have we are orchestrating a program through my store where we are well one of the ideas we're exploring is that we would have an agricultural program that we would start to pray so to teach these people have to do agricultural so that will help create now rather than in that sense providing the loaf of bread you are speaking of teaching them how to cook exactly this in our particular perspective would be more useful than my going well not necessarily but then in that sense again providing something which will then create a reliance in the self empowerment within however that is possible within that situation okay another idea that I wonder if there was more momentum to this or if it's not even a question about more or less educating them on birth control would be another obvious issue that would ultimately help them to some degree not as not as much as the agricultural project that to some degree okay the last question on this is one issue is the message for the reason that they're creating this type of experience for themselves with the message for the rest of us that aren't exploring that it what is the spiritual message for there are many and in fact as many as there are individuals looking at some of the overall messages are in that sense again empowerment and your ability to begin from what is available to move your life in a particular direction there are even within that particular situation though it may be difficult for you to see because you are focused the way that you are still within the moment to moment reality of the individuals involved certain choices and again though they may not have the same choices that you do there is still within that framework their ability to choose what excites them most and again I know this tri-blades thinly but in a sense it is our only method for communicating it but from what is available within their daily reality what excites them the most from those choices so even from that level of this empowerment of giving away your power can you function with the particular set of shall we say approaching that we discussed with you establishing who you are choosing from what is available the thing that excites you the most and acting with integrity on that particular issue also in that sense goes all the way across the spectrum to that reality and were they to do so from what is available not from what is not you cannot do anything or they cannot about what is not available right then but from what is that would generate a positive momentum even in the daily life and even in the abundance level so one other very strong assistance would be any living example of that particular perspective also understand that you all create 100% abundance in that case it is a 100% expression or an abundance in that sense of lack of abundance itself but they are still as empowered as you are and give you the opportunity to treat them that way and to also look at the issues within yourself as to where you feel that individuals do have power and do not does this make sense is that what you are asking yes thank you oh my god that is very helpful is that for the moment yes oh then shet it's hard to at least to me it's hard to sometimes ask the questions directly to me but i wanted to ask you a question why am i why not ask about a friend no i told them i thought that we did actually we did um i think we have these important times with the approach of yours all i have this friend what's a lot like me but it's not me but sometimes it's only get the point across well this friend has a question and she wants to know why is she here not why is she here on this planet but why is she here and in this room with you well i assume that from what is available this excites her the most and therefore is representative is in that sense the feedback to her that there is something within the interaction to take place and taking place that will directly be of assistance to you now in general it will be more than one thing but very often the stroking in that sense of individual self-empowerment can in and of itself be enough of a motivation to attract one to the interaction the reminder of what you already know from a non-threatening source from a non-insifting source from an unconditionally loving source that no matter what you choose i will still love does that ring a bit oh thank you for allowing me to express to your friend what you already okay um i've been um subscribing to that connecting link the one that you're written up in and um i started to read this particular new issue and the thing that i i find confusing is that so many of the different channels channels something really very different well how exciting why did they say that proceed and i'll tell you proceed any more i mean i'm saying i will tell you why i said that the cole fusing the bringing together of many different things and fusing them together so they work for you is very exciting um with the coming years ahead and all the of the what we're all going to be facing in the years you know the next three or four or five years now look the people channeling are saying um things that you know things that this transition from the third to the fourth density is going to be a smooth one with a lot of love given from various directions and if we look just move into that and some of the others are talking about all the horrors of what's going to happen to our earth and to us and it's really confusing oh we will provide a practical example a few months ago of your time you had in your country what you call hurricane now you in that sense were perhaps sitting in your house while the hurricane came perhaps felt nothing perhaps had some hot chocolate set in front of the fire perspective there was no negative outcome positive flowing outcome from the perspective of the individuals affected directly by the hurricane Armageddon therefore both are true now the question is not necessarily which will happen both will happen the question is which one will you choose which one will you manifest will your relationship with negativity be the experience of it or the awareness of it through others now are enough individuals on mass to decide to have a positive outcome then the pockets of the negativity and the negative outcome will be quite small as you say few and far between if many individuals decide the only way they can imagine changing to a new reality is by tearing down the old then there will be some experience of this type of negativity and still again pockets in that sense of people who are not touched by it may or may not be aware of if everyone is to decide in the negative outcome then you will have Armageddon across the board so the idea is that all probable futures are probable and what makes them then your reality your possible reality is your perspective your point of view your foundational attitude behind your action for that is what creates your vibration and if that vibration is of negativity then yes you will attract yourself to an area that will in that sense play out in negative terms but if you only have a positive unconditionally loving perspective you are that vibration and literally can the houses around you be falling down and yours is not touched therefore you have complete choice and our only other perspective to bring out at this point would be that one particular scenario whereby an individual with positive loving intention greatly fears the outcome you are sharing we again point out that the fear itself is a statement the fear itself is the same as saying that something you do not prefer is most likely so when you feel that look at it feel it allow yourself to feel it and then ask yourself what am i believing to feel this i will not deny that i fear it i fear it now what do i believe oh i believe this well when i believe this look how i act no wonder i get that when i now believe the opposite thing i prefer to believe that's when i plug in my imagination that's when i see what the new belief would have me doing that's when i then do the new thing then i get a different result that will then not support the continuation of the fear and in fact give evidence contrary to the necessity of the fear it is truly up to you understand that what you are perceiving in that particular publication is a toolbox some of those tools will have absolutely no functional use to you that does not mean that there is anything less useful about the tools that do apply so our suggestion in instance such as this is perhaps do not assume the all or nothing approach either it all works for me or it's all nonsense take what does work for you and apply it look at what does not apply to you and understand that by nearly the fact that you understand that it does not apply to you it has served you it has helped you define yourself and by pushing it aside leave it there for someone else who may choose to use that tool but you will find in interacting with many different individuals that the very articles as you say that our most offensive to your sensibility will be the very ones that they think are the only ones in the magazine that make sense therefore it serves many purposes and many enemies does this answer the question yes is that all i have one more question oh okay um i thought you did like i don't know six months ago or so that the deflection was going to be our last election to that there is a possibility of that nothing is chiseled in steel right but there is the possibility of and it is part and parcel and expression of the fact that you are now individually taking back your power and no longer need to assume or shall we say present that power to someone else who now perhaps you may proceed is not doing the job you wish them to do therefore you may find a restructuring it can go either way um i just thought of something else i didn't know how to do it um what do you say about the restructuring really you know as a trigger my husband and i and friends are exploring just just the gun the exploration of the idea of community do you see that as a trend in the future you're me people living together with a common um philosophy we will find from our particular perspective and approach there will be the emergence of what you call the solidification of the family and this not need not in any way necessarily mean your traditional family but the idea of the family to rally around and we'll then in that sense expand to what you sometimes call community efforts yes that will be one of the symptoms in that sense of the weaving back together of your society into a cohesive cooperative structure which is in that sense the necessity that is created is necessary to have one global community which is what we perceive within the next 30 or to 50 of your years you are moving toward as a time still separate shall we say expressions but at the same time a cohesive global community and it's going to take 30 to 50 years as the outset to some degree you will find within the next five to 10 of your years much of the groundwork being laid down and it is possible when individuals such as yourself hear our sensing of this particular energy if it is enjoyable to you you can accelerate the time oh thank you thank you we thank you as well our unconditional love to you you shut it you want hey it even as do you i have a number of questions for you and one of which feels with this election my feelings are that i mentioned this possibly in the last election it looks like Clinton's gonna win from our perspective on this end of it hello and since that the scenario it seems like the power structure that controls our government which controls bush our president it seems like he is on his train somewhat and there's another group that has control of the world banks and everything on a planet to the point where they're contriving this depression or this world recession or whatever you want to call it to the point where they want people you know they're making money off the uh the things of the people themselves going to struggles and so forth all but perhaps your designation of them as separate groups may be someone inaccurate they may be operating under one umbrella though they seem to be a pro right well that's why i mean they are one and all but they're working to make it look like their separate groups when they're not what's your uh perception of that in relation to the way our government is what we end up having only one more election let's say and we have no more elections after this election uh what will happen to the white house for the congress depending on all these things that will always structure that now exists and the people will end up they will transform and change though do understand for clarification that perhaps the sensing that was made was that you would have one more president not necessarily one more election election one more president and again it can go either way but there is some degree of momentum behind it or is a lot of in terms of the rest of your government it will in that sense be redefined but also in that sense to include other more external foreign ideas as you begin to branch out and again a global concept well there's a lot of going on and in terms of planning terms or some of the things people i've talked to and stuff that i've gone for myself is that we're due for a big scandal in our government and that it's going to come up before after the election oh how prospective is that there are a plethora of them already in do you think there's programming how close search for extraterrestrial intelligence great idea spending all the money that they have on that you think that i mean i'm saying that sarcastically it says but um you think that that's just being set up to have them part of our government released information publicly to say that we already knew that there were space people from other worlds well interesting you're getting close to our perception of the odd people now as we have shared with your particular neighborhood layout and i do mean this in terms of the star system surrounding your own your particular neighborhood it would be most unlikely to receive a random message in that way in terms of the portal of opportunity of the short time in your history that you actually use radio waves and the short time in the history of other societies that actually do wind up using radio waves and understand many if not most do not however there is something else at play so perhaps i can now update my particular perspective and understand there is the possibility again not etched but the possibility and again we remind you that your government is aware of more than one extraterrestrial civilization at least to some degree in touch with one there is the possibility that that particular media will be used for first contact it is not out of the question though it will be less random than perhaps it initially seen and more planned since it is in place it allows the opportunity for the concept in a non-threatening way to be introduced to your society so perhaps it will have a result though perhaps it will not be exactly the result that you are initially informed about well it's interesting that as a gentleman i met named stevenan grier and from our perspective he's taking a more uh direct approach exposed to sea study program center for the search extraterrestrial intelligence we are familiar with the idea yes and so what they do is they use the term veterans if you're familiar with that idea where they use synthesizers and current lights and light sounds and telepathic transition transmissions and that multiple cases where we can go now and actually communicate that way and after they've trapped it is very peaceful way it's an attempt to come together interact and have done it not physically that they've interacted at least with the telepathic music and the light sense but these are in a sense pockets of individuals who are shall we say a bit eager a little bit perhaps you can say ready what we were referring to with the overall sassy project was the dissemination to your society at law or mission the study project itself is totally different with the study project that i'm talking about um so being that they've had war our government has knowledge of more than one particular extraterrestrial civilization my idea is that we're going to use the study program as a front to initiate disseminate information eventually to mask public that is possible and perhaps becoming more problematic and my final question is there were um earthquakes in each of the three things pretty close to the pyramid and i was wondering um luckily the pyramids i don't think were hurt by it but um obviously i've had the challenge it's going to be a lot more of this these little pockets of things happening with the natural there will be a new understanding of particular fault lines which are not well understood at a map at this time however perhaps you are missing the overall point there has already been with the quote unquote damage and i am using your turn the uncovering of new cabins which is in that sense consistent with many predicted timings of such which therefore you can look at it even when so as a closing or perhaps an open so this is however does that have just been opened up one in particular that we are aware okay it would be the hall of records no comment however there will be individuals present with you this evening who will be there and you can ask them well that's all i have for now thank you very much i'll find you 100% of the number are 32 or 3 but i was wondering how this interaction that i'm myself i'm aware of only since last maybe through my story it's something like this going on all over the world i mean it has to be going on in other countries then now i'm just a series of about India i have never heard anything like this from anybody or i was there last year if i start talking about this they have been to think oh i am crazy or whatever but it has to be going on and other thing is some of the ideas i think there are people already know about them for instance the basic philosophy top always talk about i'm not going to say it correctly but something like versus i work with them which means the whole earth is one family there was this religion that okay um i'm just wondering if um people in India know about um the contact with exotency and perhaps on mass as a civilization society not so much there are pockets of individuals that do but even in what you refer to as your Vedic literature were some shall we say references to extraterrestrial technology historically speaking also were their references to technology from what you would consider to be Atlantis many times it was represented in that literature as the form of what you would call weaponry but this was not the only manifestation of that technology are you familiar with what i am saying you always wondering i mean as a child i always heard all these stories and they are not just mythological stories i believe that they did have those special examples and had helped from you know like actually where but from other they called it they called him god but i think they were things well also many times you may understand that there were portions of your civilization that were more technologically advanced than other portions and many times what mythologically winds up translating as gods was simply the coming together of these different human civilization i myself am being more aware of that moment into the tree aware of like people in the area of the quantum in some other sense start intellectually intellectually earlier things like in some way in some way they know that but that is not perhaps the focus right now hence this is one of the reasons that you find yourself physically where you are right now so that you can attract this type of information incorporate it share it with other individuals and eventually perhaps find a more receptive audience back home your ability to identify the subject and explain it as expertly as possible from the research that will be automatic in your life will increase the chances for receptivity from that country and those individuals your mastery of the subject i had heard of speed guys what's the difference between guys and extra interesting things like you can get guys from you but this is something new to me i had always been more and more i'm not pretty well understand that you are all pure consciousness what you are experiencing as being in a body is actually a body that you exist within that you create within your consciousness in other words your consciousness is not truly in your body it's the other way around your body is in your consciousness is an expression of your consciousness itself when in that sense you transform from the body and exist as perhaps you can say consciousness that is generally what is referred to when individuals are discussing spirit or spirit guides in other words non-physical consciousness in terms of extraterrestrial at least as far as i am concerned i am meaning that we have very similar to yourself though there are many differences physical body i have a body i have perhaps you can say friends i have a spacecraft i play games i sometimes do many of the things that you and your society would consider daily life therefore from my perspective when speaking of extraterrestrials we are speaking of consciousness in a body living on another planet now there are also extraterrestrial non-physical consciousness but for now we mean physical so again my particular society where we just stand face to face with you i would appear approximately five feet of your height my head in that sense would be slightly larger than your own and would have no hair my eyes are upturned almond shape and black my nose and mouth are in that sense more slight than your own but in that way still present and still shall we say functional however we no longer speak to each other in what you call words we communicate with each other through the mind tell apathy as you say we prefer to call it tell empathically for it is empathy it is identifying with the vibration of and creating similar thoughts at the same time therefore since we function in our society this way it is not at all unusual or difficult for us to when we find willing members of other society communicate directly with them tell empathically as you are seeing so the difference in general will be what you generally call spirit guide no longer express as a body are non-physical in that way and in general at least physically speaking extraterrestrials will also imply body much as your own is that clear yes it is and if this question sounds stupid but no such a thing can you just say yes or no yes or no to this question yes or no to this question yes or no to this question yes yes and can that be mutual right not if you but it's something absolutely and the vibration that would put you of the mind to do so is unconditional love identification as that be oh then on that note we will pause for a short break of 10 to 15 minutes of your counting and resume contact at that time
