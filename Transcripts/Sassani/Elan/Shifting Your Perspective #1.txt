 All right, greetings evening of your class as you create exist. Thank you, our former. Allow me to be in our adventure in the death and in the eye here. Standing your conscious aware of yourself as an Indian, as with finizing and also expanding your inner church as we have spared many time. You are all at the same seemingly separate, but at the same one rule, if conscious sense. Doctors that you eat, the same talk. So it appears that all full of reality into you can every one of you and indeed it does. Though it seems, is impossible, with seems on predictory, oh well, nature of reality, what you call, what you call constantly, is rule and the exception. The channel, expressed his point to, I mentioned that I think about what you refer to as out of body, period, that perhaps this is the most grounded of topics to this. And I mentioned to him, perhaps so to speak, in which we communicate that it was the timing to express more about features, characteristics or occurrences that become spontaneous once you do begin to find you're aware. Part of the objective part was the technology of body experience. We have already explained, in previous instances, that you do not truly guide a body to be now affected, out of the nation of what as a being is that you are consciousness and that literally you to transpose the idea of space and time, consciousness, that you're this within consciousness and not the other way. However, we have terminology because experience, transparency, residing within a body, when you begin to entertain the idea that your body, your consciousness, you begin to give your opportunity to experience of yourself simply the point of view you call the body. However, first mention it, it will entertain the idea, but perhaps you'll feel on a rudimentary that they are in a body to communicate with people to be able to have ground terminology or we your own label, body experience. What I shall endeavor to do is explain a little bit more about that from perspective, however, that your body is in your consciousness and not the other way. As you expect your awareness, you are willing to enter back, more than just your existence, more just your physical memory, you begin to experience more than your physical, when you are sad that your body exists in your consciousness as the idea, it becomes more apparent as you're willing to entertain the idea that this is if for the of a knowledge to yourself, fear of now it's here, it will finite boundaries, it will contain. So the truth, your consciousness is inaccurate, your consciousness is infinite, it goes so to see in all direction, or ever and ever and has no beginning ending, but since you are to experience a reality, a point of view, the analogy of your can be you in beginning, span your awareness, as you say be simply being a body or but not all that you are far than simply that idea and another way is that is not that your consciousness resides in your body, for the purposes of analogy, picture yourself a sphere of energy, a of pure consciousness, for the purpose of focus, picture yourself as simply being a minute point at the center of now again, these designations are all these only make sense in space, the idea of the idea of balance are all finite steps, when you begin to expand pin point I'd nest to an instant perhaps it can be to use some terminology, so this will allow you span symbology, this thing in space and time, your conception, your idea of yourself and allow you to look at it a little bit differently, more expansive, though still somewhat finite nature, now, theory and sing the idea of yourself as a sphere of consciousness, that you can do when you are, say, relaxing, alone in your roots, wherever, where you can close your eyes in a comfortable position and simply experience yourself as being a larger physical body, the idea is to simply use this analogy, you can experiment around with it as you say in your space, while you, the spherical constant, you can open the eyes of your position, it is part of the eyes of your, at the center, point in the center that your body, the apparent is that you, this within, within, that is separate from you, however I remind you, it is within, everything is within you, not only body within you, so is your chair, it was your building, so is your city, state, your country, your world, your soul, your union and your galaxy, your entire infinity, this you are and actually that, when you open your eyes at the point, and I mean your perception, which includes your five senses, that is presented by body, the idea of body, the apparent that you exist or house with the point and experience that point, you close your eyes at that point and open them else in the sphere from the perspective of the point you call body, you are now having an experience that would seem to be out of body, however, it can be still in your self, in your consciousness, not truly outside, because outside, they exist, and you will find, as you expand through the difference of awareness in what you can be your linear existence, is indeed within you, then no fear that you experience, nothing that you, it is actually outside, it's all within you, however, when create the convention, physical world, physical bond from perspective can seem to be outside, you will create what you refer out of body experience, they may have the experience of leaving their body and existing as a finite consciousness outside their body, but the next thing is, well, what is a true is that the protective portal, in senses, eyes, if you will, closed in one space location and in another space location, if you find yourself as finite, seems outside, why do we mention, have we brought this up at all, the reason is as, begin to expand or perception of who, spontaneously, automatically, you will begin these types of experience, you will find this point forward in what you, the monological time frame, that more individuals will come and speak of this phenomena and more and more of you will find yourself in this room, but also are even within your own world, you spontaneously have these experiences, it is shall I say, symptom of not only in this place, but the time being willing to be, expand your of yourself, by attracting, explain the mechanism, it allows, be more comfortable with what it allows you to experience from the perspective of the person, of exploring more of who you are and not from the perspective of and what you sometimes, downright terror, what, this to occur, when you find an experience, you are aware, you are seeing, hearing, smelling, absolutely down and your body, it is my suggestion that you simply relax into the experience, one of the perceptions that individuals will sometimes, when they create such experience, is that they have physically died, physically dying however, is a slightly different type of experience than feeling as though you have such a physical focus and seeing your body, if you find your feeling as though you are looking through eyes, ears, smelling, nose and so forth and I am telling you now, you are creating an experience where you are, here is perhaps the proper terminology, shifting your perspective and if you will allow me, I will entitle this interactive, shifting your perspective, for you do, from here to there, simply shift your perspective and experience from view point, all of which again, exist in you, now we choose the word quite carefully to always remind you that you are the power, you are through which you create your own reality, what you call God, you call all that is, is everything and is you at the same time, it is sometimes a bit overwhelming to think that you have so much, but nevertheless that is one, the quality that you may express as the ability to understand that you contain more and more. One more. All right. For the physical reasons, open this action, the exchange at this point, if there are any questions about what I have, please feel free to ask. Hey. Let's start focus. Is it, are you shifting our focus or are we actually with another aspect of the self? Well ultimately, it is you shifting your focus, but in the process, we are identifying with other aspects of what you may expect of expanding isn't more of the possibility within you. We talked about this being, and you pointed out in this sometimes, anxiously, curious about the mechanism that happens, ultimately of course, but maybe had experiences out of your body experiencing. So spontaneously that word, just of having made a decision. Are we making that decision? It is possibly an awakening like a pre-programmed Einstein's type of mechanism. It is more the idea of a press that you will achieve within yourself of acceptability. That's such an idea. Our time indicating it has to do with you to attract a source of excellence to feel more comfortable about. But once you have a certain degree that you do, in your own reality, that indeed create the, that you call your life, that your experience itself, you reach threat which has certain character experiences that are really expressed. Does this answer the question? Oh, and it brings up the question of it, developing the ability to have this deliberately. That's something that just naturally causes a time when it's, or is it something that one has to practice? The idea of practically arbitrary, an individual saying, I am not ready to have this experience. If I create XML, then I will feel qualified to have the experience. Allow me to make the following distinction. Reason for doing so. One of the reasons individuals will imagine, well, I would like to have an experience such as leaving my body is that they will feel the need for not taking responsibility for having created them as a body to as though the body, where they were put, gaping would be quite, when that is vation for that type of ability and experience, in general you will short your own ability to shift in consciousness. Probably because you now understand to be more than you fully need yourself to be and are willing to dive into exploring qualities of expansion, that is the mind through which you will be more consciously, tension full about having an experience. That rationale literally cuts you off as an exploration, expansion through the willingness to acknowledge your choice to be and simply expand your definition of experience of here, that is more of a conducive mind. The reason that we discuss here and the closing your eyes in one place within your consciousness, learning them elsewhere, is because that is the one you have made the conscious decision to have experience that will make it the simplest. Separate yourself down to part and feel you must escape from one into another, that is not conscious creation. More often, we will sometimes even create a spontaneously out of what you label death sparing. But in that instance the ability will seem to be minimal. When you have a understanding of the myth and having the desire more of yourself, then more conducive in to do so consciously. So my first suggestion is looking to have this experience rather than simply being aware that it is all right, would be to understand the mechanism and understand that is why you are trying to explain it. I had the experience many towards you that really do it, me or part of it, what's heinous and the other was I was a friend of mine carrying very, very safe conversations with her and then one minute flash in the second or less looking down from the corner of the woman, all the people walking down. But do you think to me about it was how felt and how completely safe and untouchable it was unforgettable, totally unforgettable. Well thank you, if you are everywhere and simply point of view, there is nothing wrong about that. If you as merely being the body, the body be damaged or you will then cease to exist, that you are very powerful. When you perspective and I still exist, my existence is simply the body, it is the body as an option more than just the body. That is a very powerful feeling. It asserts in terms of fact that you are consciousness, the fundamental and that body is simply an issue you choose to have as conscious. And it will become obvious and every one of you at some many individuals allow that death. But now you have the opportunity to explore more of your expanded needs without having to take such a drastic step. Hey, thank you. I am interested in the opening. I was sensing that there were mothers and that you had all agreed and that there were so weak to explore the rest. My perspective, communications with you are completely. When I engage with you, I have no agenda, no what I am going to say. Maybe a general agreed upon, but always will I, what is happening in the moment, what are their intentions, what can I offer will be across the board of assistance, upshift in energy of those at a particular point, partially due to simply being surprised. We had discussed and how we had discussed, perhaps partially being completely perplexed, understanding a word of what I have said. And this then gave me the opportunity to up for what you call discussion. In a sense is the continuing main theme anyway. Right. That makes a lot of sense. It is, as you say, on you would occur in this way, but this is an topic for us to discuss. Are these experiences preliminary to learning to be affected, playing to the existence and in this ability of some role in achieving our goals and purpose on the planet at this time in there? It is not so much pre-record to something that you will do that is from where you are right now. It is more an enhancement where you are right now that in appreciation right now to the degree that seem to feel the constant need, be someone else to do. It has to do with the situation of where you are at, assuming there is always somewhere else to distinction. I would like to address the more effective of being able to access you is more directly accepted than other planes, operational frequencies being able to interact with the beings who are native to them. So far as they work, expansive and work on the view of reality, then we are having in this limited third dimension. That will not be the re-experience. The ability to indicate with more expansive confidence a result of the choice. As you say, discussing yourself and appreciating individually but also your question puts in the assumption that you need something outside of yourself and are expanding towards it rather than that you already contain it all and are beginning to express more and more of it. And as you do, you may attract other individuals that you can now relate to more fully. Who may or may not be. But in general, if you chose to be physical, your interactions will tend to occur with physical beings, with other individualized forms or shall I say statements of consciousness that have chosen a similar exploration. There is no one out there you need to aspire to. There's plenty of company here, so to speak. But, Alon, if it were to make you more comfortable in the experience and take away the fear factor, would you ask for an alphanet then? Well, absolutely. And it wouldn't be against the rules, so to say. I mean, you wouldn't have the experience then because you might be too afraid or you could also have the experience just asked for a little help. If you ask for assistance, there is always consciousness that is willing to with this. But always will they remind you that you are actually doing it. A master or an expanded consciousness that is truly self-realized understands that everyone also contains that ability and will be the first to remind you. Alon? I have a question I need to get that. When you, the time that I have so-called, going out of body, the efficient, in my conscious awakeness, not my sleeping reality, when I came out of this, I came out of this. I came out into the world and I was almost high. I was experiencing this level of extreme joy and just this really flat, tranquil kind of state of mind. And what I am interested in is how can we live like that constantly because going to that actual place or that so-called away place, it re-energized me, recharged me, brought me back to this reality feeling now. May I ask you a question? Is it really describing this to me now in order to describe it? How does it feel? That state of being coming back? Describe that state of being to me. The feeling of it is what I did, tranquility is a place of peace, just things look different in the colors or in the hands. Do you feel that now? Mmm. A little. But the idea is that simply placing your attention upon it, simply intending to recall it, brings it up. It is not something that happens that is outside of you. It is part of you, part of your experience. Okay, so without doing the so-called exercise or the other thing, going out in the body, I can just experience it by drawing it up, that you're saying? By revisiting what I've seen or what I've experienced based on one of my experiences. Or play the game with yourself of quote unquote, remembering what it was like in order to remember you recreated. And in our dream state, what we so-called actually projects, is that similar to when we do it in this reality? Your entire dream state is a shifting of your perspective and the creation of a seeming reality around it. It is very, shall I say, little different from your actual life. Your life itself, from the consciousness point of view, is a dream. It contains with it certain properties or agreed upon definitions one of them being continuity. So you wake up from your nighttime sleeping dream, that experience, which is rather disjointed in nature, generally speaking, and you wake up into this dream seeming like it is the next day. But you actually recreate the entire reality with the built-in definition of continuity. And on that same note, to finalize this, is that this past week and a half, I've been feeling this ecstatic joy and happiness that has been very close to what I described a while ago, which is interesting that I even asked the question because I have been really joyful this past week. I haven't been able to sleep. My dreams have been shut down. I've been just excited to get up and continue to live this reality. I haven't been sleeping at all. And I just wanted to add that and ask you about it. I don't know if you can. As you begin to expand your consciousness and live this dream consciously, there will be less of a difference where you feel the need to create that dream, this dream. But in this particular instance, I also, shall I say, sense the presence of what you call anxiety. So in your instance, that is not precisely what is occurring. Do you understand what I am saying? I do, but I've asked myself that and I've been really very happy. I'm not sure what the anxiety is about. I don't, I haven't interpreted as anxiety at all. I've been very excited. And I'm very honest with myself too. I don't think I'm... Is there anything else? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. My name. Greetings. And who you? I had, I took this out of body class a couple months ago and in that class we all relax. And I felt like this energy come up from my lower chakras. And I saw a, I had a vision of a hole opening up above me. It seemed like there was about 12 people that were reaching down. It wasn't me to seem like they were going to pull me up through. And at that point I kind of had some fear that came through. And the energy went back down. Why do you ascribe that you had fear? I think because I heard of a guy, the experience of this person told me about that he tried at that one time and he had a bad experience where he tried at one time and he went out of his body and he didn't come back and just kept going and then he woke up in the hospital or something like that. I think that I'm afraid that if I go out there that I'll be separate from my body and I won't know exactly how to get back. I just, it just seems like an experience that I want to be able to prepare for it. What is your purpose or reason for wanting to have such an experience? To reclaim, I would say to reclaim our original powers or our attributes. If that is truly your reason, then what is the nature of the fear that in so reclaiming you could be lost? Well, I don't know. I guess maybe because of this man went through. My suggestion is simply this. Allow yourself to examine once again your reason for desiring to do so. Allow yourself to be clear about those reasons. Allow yourself to be aware of any nuance of utilizing the experience as an escape and handle it. This course will. And also understand the following. Being an experience of shifting your perspective is not a matter of effort. It is a matter of allowing. The posture, the attitude for allowing the experience of expansion is a letting go, not a holding on. You do not need a leg up. You do not need individuals pulling you, trusting you, birthing you into another form of yourself. All that presupposes a tightness, a holding on an anchoring. So allow the symbols to be obvious and allow yourself to understand that letting go, allowing, is simply that. It is relaxing, trusting, being comfortable. And as an experience begins to create itself around you, so to speak, that will be the appearances, allowing it to happen, understanding that the safety valve, if you must have such a concept, is that you, you have the choice at any given time to shift your perspective once again, seemingly again back into the body. And again, simply from one portion of yourself to another portion. The other individual that you are referencing did operate through a degree of wishing to escape fear and effort. That is the only general comment that I can make. I have another similar question related to that is, when you go out of the body, I notice a lot of people say, for now, simply to embody the understanding of what we are sharing, rather than referring it as going out of the body, refer to it as shifting your perspective. Do proceed. You shift your perspective. I've heard many times where people then are not aware of their perspective in the body, they just aware of their perspective out of the body, but can't you have both perspectives simultaneously? Absolutely you can. But that will be a different type of experience. It would not feel so much as the experience that we are describing. It would be more like an expansion with a simultaneous awareness of many aspects of yourself. In general, more than just two. That's a different experience. The experience we are speaking of is the finite shifting of your consciousness from one particular space-time coordinate within yourself to another space-time coordinate within yourself. Finite focus generally can be defined as experiencing one thing at a time, one moment then the next, one particular object, one item, one idea. The linear finite presentation of consciousness generally takes that form. The moment you are aware of more than one thing, you are perhaps you can say less than finite, and that is a different experience altogether. That is an experience of your particular self that you may begin to refer to as simultaneity, which is by definition different than finite. One other aspect to that is there was twelve beings I thought up there in just a couple weeks for last week to have this meditation where I felt I saw those twelve beings again in the meditation there. There was a golden glow and then through it. I saw a panel of twelve and they called themselves the galactic federation. Is that true? Is there such a galactic federation? There is such an idea. What you are experiencing may be referred to as a societal archetype of your own civilization that has what you call very ancient roots as well as what you would call extensions into the future as well. It has much to do with what you would call your mythology as well as many of the archetypal substream ideas present within your society. For now simply allow it to be obvious what it means to you at that moment where that is what will be relevant to the experience in that moment. All right? Along with my pleasure. Could you say that we have a choice of we're shifting our perspective? So can you explain if we wanted to shift our perspective and not shift it back into the finite point of the body? Would that be death and could we do that? Very tricky. The way that you have worded the question. In general, were that your approach, were that your perspective, you wouldn't have been endeavoring for the shifting of consciousness, for the purposes of expanding your awareness. You would have known as you began that you were escaping so to speak. So if that were your frame of mind, you would be perhaps I will say less likely short of using impossible that you would create that form of experience. Do you understand what I am saying? Yes, I guess my confusion is in what is the shift of perspective or isn't a shift, isn't it? Is it not a shift of perspective when one dies? Dying is more a simultaneous expansion where you still will experiencing yourself as a singular being. But you will not relate strongly to what you call pinpoint consciousness. So again, you will have the experience of containing the reality that you used to believe you existed within, more than remaining finite in another location. Now it becomes somewhat difficult to explain because you still do maintain a singularity of yourself as a singular consciousness, since you are still very strongly, shall I say, identifying with what you would call earth plane, human experience. But it is more of an expansion, more of the idea of a simultaneity expression than a singular shift. Male. Over there. Okay. No. Pardon me. Someone else. You're wrong. Proceed. See me. I wanted to say the President asked the last question because he had that very question, the car coming down here and I had told my friend tell his question, did he answer? He said, I'm not going to answer that question. The other thing I wanted to thank you about for was the topic of this discussion. One thing I care to talk about tonight was a wonderful experience I had with my husband a few weeks ago and that was feeling that he was me and that I was him, that there was absolutely no difference at all. I was very special and I hope I have that often again. Oh, that is another shall I say version of what we are seeking of though again more of a simultaneous form of consciousness. Will you understand yourself to be more than just one thing? Very exciting. Hey. My. My personal question gets away from the topic a little bit. Proceed. My name is Russ. We have left. My question is, we're involved with my wife Tracy and I. We've noticed some physiological and emotional patterns that are symptomatic and repressed memory. There's a real tabloid question. We wanted to know if we'd been involved in an abduction experience at all and I use that word loosely because I understand the nature of the potential agreement. Before I proceed, allow me to ask you a question. May I? Sure. Hold on. Without needing to be too specific in what you call a crowd, have some of the physiological occurrences that you each create that we have discussed changed in their nature. Are you feeling better as you say in your vernacular? The physiological changes haven't really improved at the point where we're completely happy. Have you seen a difference? Absolutely. Have you created through the awareness of things that we discussed a difference in your approach? Certainly. Have you found an improvement overall? Yes, to all those questions but I think that it's more of a nagging curiosity now which asked me to, you know, this point in the question. Allow me to place the answer in the following format. Though you are in position for a certain style of contact, it is not the physical contact that you are speaking of. That designation is purely arbitrary. Allow me to simply call it consciousness but it is in no way what you would call data experience and it is in no way the reason for the creation of the symptoms that we have discussed. Otherwise, we would have mentioned it before. Thank you. Is that all? Yes, ma'am. Oh, are you a ma'am? I had thought that perhaps you may have shifted abruptly. Who was reading? As were you, good day. I was really... Before we proceed, allow me to ask you, was it what you expected? Is this the topic here? The way that it was explained. Not quite. I didn't really know what to expect. I heard you talk about this before, seeing ourselves in the middle of the sphere and opening our eyes other than the center. But I wanted to ask you some more specific questions about... Oh, do you proceed to me, by the way? It was the first time. I went to a really interesting seminar this past weekend, put on by John Mack and one other person, John Mack is the person who studies a lot of UFOs and stuff from Harvard. And it was a seminar about the holotrophic breathing developed by Stanislaw Croft. The way that it works is we all, each of us, went into a two and a half hour meditation where we did deep breathing to very intense, loud music. It was supposed to bring on these kinds of experiences. And many people there had really kind of fantastic trips. The lady that, the co-leader said that we would be taken where we needed to go to heal whatever was up in our lives right now. And some people went back to childhood stuff, some people experienced to rebirth. Some just had very traumatic experiences. I kind of wanted to know what was going on there. How did that... What was the mechanism? How were we able to breathe in and listen to how people were able to travel and have that kind of intense experience? Ultimately, what happened was perspectives were shifted by those willing to participate using any particular, shall I say, procedure or methodology. And I mean, this loosely as an excuse. It isn't the procedure. It isn't the process in and of itself that creates the experience. But sometimes that is what an individual will create to allow themselves to create a threshold of believability that such a shift is possible. My question to you is, what was your experience? And did you judge yourself for it? Yes, I judged myself for it. I started doing a breathing. I tend to be more in my head than a lot of other people. So it's harder for me to do something. Not only do you perceive yourself as being within your body, but confined to the head. Alright? Thank you. Anyway, I started doing a breathing. And I wasn't really sure what to expect. And then after about a half an hour, maybe even an hour, my chest started to tingle and my arms in the hands started to tingle and I started to feel really weird. And at that point, I felt like I had to go to the bathroom for it. I got after went to the bathroom and threw up the experience. And I wasn't able to fully recapture that again. So I... Well, I assume that you then judge yourself, yes? You're kind of failing or being afraid to go, I had a dream the night before that the message was, I was afraid to go into the unconscious. I didn't want to see tipped over out of the boat into some water and it was kind of some resistance to going into the unconscious. Oh, what? Well, you bring up an excellent point, as I always rely on all of you to do in one form or another. Judgment, the lack of complete unconditional self-love, is not exactly the most conducive atmosphere, is not exactly the most conducive approach to being willing to expand and experience more of yourself. In other words, if you create any level or degree of what you call the stuff about who you already define yourself to be, you will not be so likely and willing to want to explore more of that being. So your willingness to use this as a fulcrum, as a lever, if you will, to allow yourself to completely be who you are, to love yourself for who you are completely and unconditionally is what allows you to then be more likely to allow yourself to explore more of yourself. Does this make sense? Yes, it does. Oh, right, now, as we had discussed, perhaps you can say in a linear way, last interactions, that can simply take the form of just doing it. In other words, to use your example, saying to yourself, all right, all right, I judge myself. I had an expectation. I did not create according to my expectation, but so what? I still love myself and I will not use this as evidence for anything else. Also now that I have more of a grasp of what the experience is and why I may wish to have it, I know that I need to love myself in order to have it. Then you can decide whether you wish to continue to stand in your own way or to let yourself by, so to see. But to understand again that judgment is not allowed, is not letting go. It is a very tight holding on. It is a very contracted form of consciousness. Well, as I went on with these periods, I didn't have something as intense as something else happened that I was asking about after I came back in like a second hour. They were playing this intense music from the mission and it was like some choir sounding music or whatever. I just spontaneously started trying and feeling a lot of intense shame like that I was some bad sinner or something from a few centuries ago or something like that, like really that God didn't love me or something like that. The reason I bring this up is because I'm trying to surface any beliefs that don't serve me that prevent me from creating. And now that the belief has surfaced and each individual may contain their own variation of such an idea from very mild to very intense. What with the tools that you have at your disposal can you do right now to transform that? In other words, if that's who you were and allow me to simply say, since you have all lived many thousands of lives, you have all created that mindset at some point. If that's who you were, but that is no longer who you are, what is the difference? If that's who you were and you feel that you are still like that, now is the opportunity to forgive yourself. Which do you choose? I forgive myself. Did you do that? At the end I did feel very peaceful. I felt peaceful after the thing. But the question I had was if there was still some underlying lack of self-love within me that I wasn't aware of, it was kind of like controlling me. Very easy answer. You tell me. Do you wish, understanding anything is possible from this moment forward and all of it is determined by your approach. Do you establish right now that you still create this or not? This is how conscious you can be about choosing to create your reality in each and every moment. We have to say no, I love consciously, I love myself. If you truly then made that decision, what form would acting that way take? In other words, when these considerations come up, having made the decision to fully love yourself, how would you handle it? I would judge myself. Or if you did, what would you do? Forgive myself. Always. Is that difficult? No. Is it too simple? No, it's not too simple. It's just sometimes it seems, I don't think to get it. But allow me to address this in the following way. And this applies to all of you in any situation. Literally speaking, literally, from the perspective of the most accurate way to describe the way that you create your consciousness. You create yourself in each and every moment completely. What you consider to be the last moment has no effect on how you create yourself in this moment until you plug in that definition. So you have the opportunity to decide right now who you are no matter who you ever perceived that you had been. Therefore what this is leading up to is technically speaking, literally speaking. There is no such thing as remnants. It is a recreation in the moment dragging that definition into this moment. Now being made aware of the fact that nothing is remnants, does that take some of the pressure off? Does that allow you to understand yourself that much more clearly? To understand that no, what is happening right now is not a remnant behavior of me not loving myself. What is happening right now is me choosing right now not to love myself and perhaps using that history as an excuse. I understand that I just wish that my default mode could be an unconditional love. Well if you wish that implies you are not making the decision right now, that that is something to acquire, that that is the frame of consciousness to get to because you are not there. And that is not the positive decision in the moment that this is who I am. I am unconditionally loving. Period. And no matter what thought comes up, this is who I am. There is no remnant. Perhaps what you are experiencing as a remnant is not being willing to be that asserted with yourself to restate who you are, to realign to your positive decision in the moment, but now that you are aware of that, you can do it from this point forward. I wanted to have more questions about out about experience. Oh, why? Well, when those people went on the trips that they took and went to places, the ways that you will go to a place, her name was Honey K or something like that, she said you will go to the places where you need to go to heal. And sometimes when people do past life regressions, they spontaneously go back to a specific past life. Who is it that directs you to that life? What is the intelligence that says this is where you need to go and heal? It is your own intelligence. It is you creating a phenomenon or a symbol that allows you in the moment to make a decision, but it is the decision made in the moment that has the effect, not any recapitulation of any past event. So you can do it that way. You can use whatever symbol you will attract to yourself to make yourself aware of it. And you can create a lengthy process to clear out all the remnants. Or you can simply understand that what I am saying describes the mechanism and gives you the opportunity to not need to create a process, but simply create an experience. Even shifting your perspective, you do not need to create the idea or an awareness of yourself as a sphere, your body in the middle. That is simply a perspective to allow you to redefine your definition of your health so that that experience will make sense from a more empowered perspective. But there is no process necessary. Only what you feel that you will require to convince yourself to express your power in the moment. And your power is the ability to shift at any given moment. It is also the ability to be aware, consciously aware of your surroundings in the moment, which if you are truly committed to, may necessitate being in the body perspective and not escaping to somewhere else. Well, can you, I am believing for St. John tomorrow morning for two weeks down in the Caribbean. And I want to, like a spiritual retreat at the Omega Institute. And I want to do some of this kind of meditation and maybe if it will have value in terms of me having a more fulfilling life, I would like to do some of these exercises down there. So can you tell me, or can you tell me some specifics of how I can induce this kind of state, which I seem to be kind of resistant to it? First of all, address what you consider to be your resistance. Because resistance is friction. This is effort. Resistance is this is pushing so I must pull. That is not conducive to shifting your perspective. So first of all, whatever symbol that you create, that your imagination presents as a symbol for letting go, for ceasing to exert, for relaxing, begin with that. And understanding that because your consciousness is infinite, you can begin to expand your experience into more of that space, so to speak. Allow any spontaneous experience that comes up through relaxation, through allowance with no agenda to simply allow you to try on more of your consciousness. You can use the idea of the sphere, you can use the idea of the point, but not with any insistence or rigidity, because again rigidity is effort. Rigidity is complex. Allowance is letting go and simply being again more of who you are. So perhaps finding a comfortable position, allowing yourself to simply be. Allowing yourself to feel yourself spreading out in all directions. And then at some point, if you are invoking yourself to open your perceptive eyes, do so and see what you see. If you see something that is as blatantly physical as looking for your eyes, so be it. If not, allow whatever experience occurs, whatever image occurs to be valid. When you shift your perspective, you can shift it in what you call the greed. Allow me to give an example when individuals are, as you say, relaxing, about to fall asleep. They achieve social stake mistakes. Your scientists refer to it as the hip nagogic state. As this is described as body asleep mind awake. But however you choose to define it, it is the experience of images which seem real, which seem complete, which seem like experiences. But nevertheless are somewhat phantom-like, pleasing. That is the shifting of your consciousness. That is an example of a valid exploration and experience. It is what you would refer to very literally as, and again, in your terminology and out of body experience. It is beginning to soften your focus, to allow your point of view to include more of who you are. Are you aware of the experience I am describing? Yes, so I am describing that. Have you ever not upon falling asleep had certain fleeting images come to you? Yes, more of an habit. What I am waking up I feel like I am in a dream. Oh, but they are not necessarily in college or as vivid as what you see through your waking eyes. Yes. Oh, I will make the allowance for those degrees of experience and do not insist in what you call all or nothing. That is my complete suggestion. Relax. And I have one last question about pathwise. Is there a value in me doing pathwise progressions? And how should I do it in my life so I look at it? In my opinion, if you are doing it to identify remnants, it is a distraction. It is allowing you to create new excuses for not being fully who you wish to be. If you are doing it truly for exploration, that is different. But in my own assessment of the asking of the question for you, it would seem like you are taking the first approach. As you begin to expand into who you are and have an experience, you very well may spontaneously have what you call a memory of a path like whereby in a particular moment in that life you had a similar experience. That is different. That is simply an enhancement. That is simply a bleed through of where your experience now is relevant to that experience. That can be quite positive and you can learn from that in a positive way. Again, if you are using it to identify something that you are doing wrong or that is wrong with you or wrong in your life now, you are actually creating that now once again and it is more of a distraction in that way. So use it if you insist on using it to revel in who you are rather than to explain short coming. There are no short coming. There are no remnants if you will live that way from this moment forward. The thing I was thinking about was your commitment to relationships, your commitments to getting married or something and thinking if something might have happened in the past it would make me afraid of that. In understanding that you have created life, there have been commitments that have been fulfilling, there have been commitments that were perhaps made through lack of integrity and then had the corresponding results of that. All of it is there. So choose who you are now. Decide who you are now. Purpose, consciousness. Make that decision if you choose to. Trust that and act that way as we have discussed and everything else will simply be icing on your face. I need some help. I was going along quite nicely in my life today. Our motivated way and my body said that's not the end. I now stream to a pain. I worked really hard. Feeding myself and burdening myself and I say I'm about 90% there and eating that pain. But I'm not probably and I need some help and help you. I can use that. What are you presently experiencing? And anyone who is listening to this simply inserts if you are creating what you call pain. Your own pain and the explanation will work off the board. New proceeds. Pain and largest described pain. Pain is the most important. What is it that you continue to experience the so-called remnants of your sentence? I'm choosing pain in my bladder. I'm out there. Pain and I just come from the bathroom. What is your understanding of this? My understanding in medical community does not know why. They think it may be neurologically safe. My personal feeling is to do with all the stress that I'm putting myself into the fight and my mind at work. I don't know if I'm going to talk about that. But I know it keeps coming back a little bit. I'm so not able to keep a coping mission or they go away coping. There are individuals present this evening who may be of assistance to you as a general concept. My suggestion is this. Set up a model within your thesis whereby you can picture in your imagination how you wish to see. Continue to superimpose that model in your thinking upon your experience. Do not let your experience talk you out of who you know yourself to be, but remind yourself who you are when that particular shall I say situation arrives. Does that make sense? For now again there are individuals you can access to our presence this evening. You can be of further assistance as well. All right? Three men. Three. Three. Three. Three. Three. Three. Three. Three. Three. Three. Three. Three. Three. Three. Three. Three. Three. Three. Three. Three. Three. One. Three. Three. Three. Three. One. Zero. One. Zero. One. Zero. Three. Two. Number one. Follow. Three.alt. Three.American.both.sing. sweet. Two. These are all children. Iioto. visually ritualistic, they are not as you say marked on the calendar for the season we have no calendar for today but there are celebrations there are gatherings of many individuals who express joy and revelation in many ways thank you for that. Number two. I'd also like to know you have some sort of time on your plan. You know like we have time as in one o'clock, two o'clock, do you have any things to apply on your plan? No not in the way that you are describing where we have created technology to keep track of it. We are far more loosely associated with what you would call the cycle of day and night because we do not per se sleep as you do so therefore we are constantly busy, constantly moving about and in general in the way that we structure our society do not create agendas and all of our actions are spontaneous. All of our actions are completely committed to, lived through, participated in and allowed to flow according to their timing. Now because we interact with other societies we are aware of the idea of scheduling. We can in that sense participate in the idea of scheduling but not in the way that you might imagine. For instance your particular experience is that the channel starts the interaction at eight o'clock. Well let's say that is theoretical. It has not generally started at that time. It is not that on my end an alarm goes off and then I am sitting waiting for the channel to sit down, finish talking and then I can speak. I simply go about my business and then I am aware when it is time on this and circumstances have played out on a particular way on this end. Now is the time. I will then participate in the experience in whatever way I will. Many times lying down in a state of repose, occasionally sitting, occasionally interesting enough going about my business and simply having an afterthought which can translate into a long transaction on your end. But in a sense I am not bound to a schedule and when it comes up for me no matter when it never interferes with what I am doing because it is part of the coincidence and synchronicity of my experience. Since I trust everything that happened when it happens and would have nothing else happening but what is happening in a given moment it always seems to occur for me just when I had a moment. So there is the idea of everything still working out. We can shall I say play with the schedules of other individuals but so loose is our attachment to timing, to time, to clock time that my experience is never that rigid eye. Does that make sense? In the way that you have structured your society there still is shall I say the necessity to say in agreement with what you call clock time because your society so structures itself in that way but within the confines that you creative clock time is a lot of leave way and you can begin by simply being more spontaneous keeping your agreements and commitments of schedule but as you are more spontaneous in between you will find everything will lose you and your whole idea of a schedule will shall I say transform itself to be far more spontaneous. And I thank you as well. At this time we will pause for a short break and resume contact in 10 to 15 minutes of your counting.
