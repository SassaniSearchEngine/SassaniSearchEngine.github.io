 All right, I'll say before we continue, allow me to ask you all the questions. When you did in that sense conjure up the preferential, preferential, right there before you, standing in glistening, splendor in your imagination. Did you like what you saw? Is there anyone who did not? Understand that you are already that you and your willingness to proceed as that you is all that it so to speak requires to continue to create yourself as that you. Colloquially speaking in a reality where you create time, linear time, you are always in each given moment so to speak, recreating who you are. Very often plugged into that equation is a particular expectation of shall we say a non-preferential use and therefore you recreate that you, you re-establish that you, you re-be that you. Now you can do the very same thing with the preferential use and the fact that you did in that sense like what you see and like what you did see is a representation that you truly do within yourself. Love yourself and have the capacity to unconditionally love yourself. What you saw was not unobtainable. What you saw is the reality in the consistent recreation of who you are that you now choose to be by simply referring to it where necessary and simply automatically performing the actions of that self when possible you will perpetuate the re-creation of that preferred use again much in the same way that you had perpetuated the unprepared use for the flaw. It is not a matter of learning anything new simply reapplying according to preference what you already are expert at. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Good to you. Could you use that referential preferential treatment for people who have addictions? Right. Absolutely. And no for instance is actually necessary. It works across the board. When an individual is about to partake of what you call an addiction he can or she can in that sense simply before doing it call up the referential preferential term and over the referential to the referential preferential self be particular circumstance. See what that you does to in a sense fulfill and satisfy but through integration and through purposeful and through desire of who they desire to be for shall we say deep down inside. It is our protection that most if not all individuals truly desire to be self empowered truly desire to rely on themselves. So by invoking that referential preferential self they are in a sense empowering that already empowered perspective and will come up with a different set of actions that can be quite satisfying. How about when the child is very young though I'm thinking of babies they have pictures of babies in the room before they're born sucking their thumbs and I have two granddaughters that have had tremendous teeth problems because of this and they're still very young and have had the teeth problems corrected but still have that urge to suck the thumbs. So how could how could I apply that for something like that? Well you can do it in much the way that we have shared. They understand to some degree the ability to use the imagination perhaps sometimes more vividly than even yourself but also in that sense perhaps you can also inquire as to again what they get out of it what it allows them to do and then perhaps provide other methods by which such a thing can be achieved without the same quote unquote side effect but the referential preferential you will work in that instance if they use. Would this work for people who are homosexual for having a hard time with their polarity of their sexuality? Well it depends on which way you mean it is not our perception that there is absolutely anything inherently wrong with that. With the homosexual problem not problem but situation of exploration it is one of the options in this reality. Thank you. And we. Hello. Hi. Hello. Greetings. Hi. Hi. Are you on your scale craft? Hi. Mr. Shah there. No. Would you say hello to Shah for me? Hi. You down there? Hi. Say hello to all of you. Great things return. I was thinking this morning when I was reading a transcript about crime that what I understand from the transcript at this time is a man made creation that we use to. Well also women. Human made creation that we use to separate ourselves from all it is. Well in a sense but again it is also a means by which experience can be in a sense of human in a reality that contains such an idea. And again with the creation of the space within a physical reality the time in that sense to explore and discover within. Do proceed. Well I have I got the first note was it separated from all it is because it didn't allow us this understanding of time. Well what about. It has not separated you from all that. You have chosen to experience this style of separation that is the medium through which you express. Right. Because it doesn't allow us to understand that balance to be everywhere and everyone all at once. Well understand that although you are everywhere and everywhere and all at once you are also discreet individuals separate from the rest at the same time. The paradox is that both are equally valid both are expression of creation itself and there is nothing better about the integrated state than what you might sometimes refer to as the disc integrated state. They are equal statements equal reality. Well my question why that there are also includes that we are everyone and this I have a lot of trouble with I can't. Well that is why in general you will attract the terminology over soul and still to some degree break it down in that way. But if you understand the over soul of the over soul of the over soul and continue to so to see traded back you will find all that is to be the ultimate one over soul. So ultimately that is true. That I understand but that we need to include everyone. Very hard to count the hands. What. Perhaps again from the perspective of separation the concept of all that is is a bit overwhelming in another. But understanding that all that is is perhaps again colloquially speaking your ultimate over soul and that this applies to everyone else. You are literally emanating from one source and transport app a singular connection all is literally one. Now that one event so to speak is being expressed in the multiplicity of occurrences that you consider to be like but ultimately speaking you will understand experientially the one that and the simultaneity but not at any pace that is too soon only as you in a sense choose to discover more of the simultaneous presentation of your being will you then be so to speak spoon fed more and more so you need not experience anything until you are ready and requesting it. That helps a lot. I thought something I haven't seen before. Well thank you. One other question I thought he'd be show about Alcatraz and they had a psychic gone visit what he used to be Alcatraz and he said about a hundred entities there that he felt were past prison innocent. As you can say again colloquially speaking the footprint of the extreme emotionality of that particular statement of their life not so much entities hanging around with nothing better than it. That was my question. What was the phenomenon taking place? It wasn't the actual entity that was well they can be invoked where and when but it is again because of the negative assignment of the situation so to speak charged in a way that would appear to leave a footprint. And that's really what I'm saying and individual sensitive to that can happen to it. Others may absolutely find nothing but for again your insurance no one is hanging around. Thank you very much. I have a question before I forgot about it though. If you heard another question or lead on question about November 2nd in terms of the thing in New Year. It is not necessarily celebrated in that way we were simply in that sense sharing with you from the archetypal upstream of your reality. The reason of or shall we say the originating cause of the designation of those particular memorial remembers. Well also being asked today of our general elections in the United States. I'm sorry November 3rd when I was talking about here in my stuff to choose here on the first point. But where do we go from here in New Year in a sense. What does that mean in our terms. Well again it will depend on each individual's relationship to this in general you consider your January 1st to be your new year again depending upon your heritage and background. The significance to you will be absolutely individual. Therefore upon that day if there is some reason for you in that sense to celebrate this idea and do so and be quite aware and open shall we say streams of consciousness that occur then you will establish the significance to yourself. Very often there will be little significance to many individuals. What do you perceive as happening in terms of our government in terms of before the end of this year beyond the elections. This is a general question for which we will simply provide the general answer that no matter what occurs great change there will be. What occurs will be a representative symbol of the state already having been initiated of the transformation itself. So it is not our general style to render specific predictions. I want you to do that. Well obviously I'm telling you. Well I remember to. Are you a psychic? No. Just joking with your. Oh thank you. My other question was he's very back to the light in the room before I was talking about the light. I didn't really elaborate on that much and I have a question about the light at the same time. Can you kind of delve into these lights that I've been seeing recently and what they represent. All we will share is that as you expand your point of view and as you are more willing to be open in that way you will also expand your physical sense to see things which are here to for unperceptible. We have discussed this or shall we say more appropriately. Bishar has discussed this with you before. Well it seems to me very clearly without you know a very comfortable feeling of seeing them and I'm not I'm just wondering what they are. Even since you may understand they are the logical progression of the sparkle that you used to see now coming together more concretely and all of it. Okay thank you. And back there mayo. Yes. One moment. You are? Yes. Okay. Sorry about that. No need to apologize. Your meditation felt very grounding and it seems to show. Oh thank you. Then I have done my job. Absolutely. It seems to shift the energy in our room here and the sense of my field of the cohesiveness of us as a group. By the way any time you are willing to simply in any endeavor with any individual's presence particularly if there is a common goal to breathe in that way together you will achieve that same feeling. Coast fire. Well it's very very rich. I just wanted to just for a moment this experience I've had with the thing of allowing that I've been experimenting with in this past few months. Then I will allow you to think. Well just that I have found it to be a very fruitful expression of my learning to allow more fully my life to be as it is to allow the people around me to be as they are to allow the feeling to come up from time to time within me to be as they are without trying to push or change or force it to be something other than it is. And well this idea I gleaned from being here that I just found it very very useful. Well perhaps in the conjuring up of your preferential preferential you there was little difference between that you and the you you consider yourself to me. You are already doing it. Actually there wasn't any difference in my conjuring up of that image. That makes it no less useful but thank you. It's very useful to me. And there was some difference of feel inside of me as I sat within this being and then I grabbed myself back to this room I could feel something more powerfully grounded within me as a definite option. You are allowing the expression of more of yourself through the same cycle. I had a dream which was somewhat interesting to me and I'm not quite sure. I had a dream where I was doing a case that was full of acts and I was just watching them and suddenly I felt these things biting on my fingertips and I was somewhat alarmed and the person next to me said oh that must be that's Shiva. And I said what? Anyway I ran out of the room and I ran to get in the shower and tried to and the events were like chasing me down the street. Well in a sense understanding that they represent what lies underneath the surface you cannot escape. Do proceed. So might I interpret that as the things that I've been hiding under the surface of me are coming quite to the surface. And it's perhaps you'd inquire from them my dear child what would you like that I perhaps can give you other than my fingertip. You will then find something will be forthcoming and what in that sense is presented to you will be an aspect of yourself that perhaps you have not faced presenting itself. Perhaps an aspect that in the past you would have labeled all right awful but you will understand that once it presents itself it is not so awful. And in effect is requiring your attention and love to integrate. The ignorance of it is in that sense what allows it to become louder and perhaps have a bite. So I'm going to get the practice I allow. I said perhaps next time bring the money. They will in that sense appreciate it far more than the fingertip. Thank you very much. Thank you. And to you my question my first question also has to do with the election November 3 and specifically the president that will be elected. My brother and I both strongly want pro to be our next president and as you probably know my brother is following his excitement to an extreme degree as he does everything with tremendous courage, creativity and aggressiveness. And to be honest with you I feel that maybe sometimes his ideas and expectations are unrealistic in our culture today. That is why he is he and you are he. Amen. Now can you give me. I understand that in a sense to be an invalidation but I will allow it to sit. Can you give either one of us any advice over the next ten days here or whatever until November 3. Have a good time and do not allow anyone to talk you out of who you know yourself to be not even your brother. That goes for both. No I feel real good about the way I've been conducting myself with him and been serving as sort of a sounding board to some of his ideas. That is a great service as well. Your willingness to be forthcoming with who you are need not take the form of invalidating what he is doing but simply perhaps here and there and we are providing alternatives. I do believe my head is in the clouds by insists that my feet are on the ground. One moment. I'm not sure about it. It is our perception that they are. You talking about my feet? Okay thank you. John, thank you. I will switch over quickly to a different question. Could you compare the law of attraction to the universal law that what we put out is what we get back. In a sense they are identical and also can be expressed as the statement that we have shared that you can only experience a reality that you are the vibration of and in the establishment of the referential, preferential view you decide consciously what you wish your vibration to be provided to yourself, projected to yourself in your imagination and your willingness to assume those actions is the assumption of that vibration thereby changing what you will attract and this will be immediately obvious to anyone who is willing to participate in action with what we are sharing. Then given this law of attraction it would seem to me for example in dealing with other humans and let's be specific here that if I find that I'm very attracted to another female that I can assume well, likes attract likes and therefore that feeling will probably be returned. Well in a sense you are reading shall we say many things into a situation. Perhaps you can say if you are attracted to someone that is interacting with them and allowing yourself in whatever way is available to glean some interaction may be the point of the attraction altogether and need not then assume and be responsible for how they feel and what is attracted to them. Utilize the attraction in the form of well obviously there is something to explore with you and you need not in that sense extend it beyond that. When you are willing to consciously go forth and explore it then either what you are saying will be obviously so or you will derive something else which will then fulfill why you were attracted to the first place. When you begin to set up an expectation scenario very often you will set up the disappointment as well. You know the exact reason for the attraction which then in a sense gives you tunnel vision and does not allow you to remain open to see why you are actually attracted. So if Mark might say allow it to unfold. Hey but at the same time understand that what you are attracting is a reflection and an opportunity to explore not be one person who will make you complete which assumes you are not. Well maybe you can have the reverse problem that you have too many people to deal with. Well if you wish to call it a problem then perhaps you will get that effect. If you wish to understand it as a situation you can revel in that as well. Opportunity. Thank you very much. And who you. Oh. So guess what. I give up. My birthday is coming up. Well. Have you. What day is. Well first of all today. No. Or you have in that sense recreated yourself and perhaps happy birthday would apply to you all. However in terms of your physical birth do proceed. November 2nd. Oh. Then you have as the scenic. Ritten. It occurred to me when you were talking earlier about November 2nd said I died in the morning and I was in that Atlanta. As did basically everyone. Well that's what I got and I realized that we all shared this summer to you. Well you also are now sharing the fact that ha ha you're still alive. And are perhaps once again rejoining on their more integrated service. Playing out the other end of the title perhaps that will be perceived as more joyful. And what. Follinating. Well now I begin to understand why I've always been so over common emotions on my birthday because it was actually a death day. Well in a sense. Was the day after which would represent the having survived. So it was. That also can be emotionally shall we say over well. You mean the third of November was the day of our destruction. No what you call your all hollows. E your Halloween was day before. What you call November 1st day of what you call November 2nd day after. Perhaps again the day after would be the beginning of a new era. So can you elaborate on why I should stay to incarnate. Well in a sense as a reminder as a constant reminder that you are each. That you are. A new. That you have an extent explored. Add in tonight and so to speak the negative perspective and now you are providing the positive alternative can be a civil. So now I'm tuning into the choice. The conscious choice I've given myself to bring the Phoenix. The cost yes. And to experience the positive preferred outcome. Having the life that you prefer but not needing to feel that that need be at the cost of someone else or yourself. Full circle. Can we briefly discuss this. That's rattle that. If in that sense you have shall we say explored it and expanded on your particular point of view and will share that with me. There may be the opportunity to do so if you are and basically the same place. No. I feel kind of living in a paradox. So it's kind of interdimensional. My sense about what's happening to me. And do you feel things so to speak shaking loose within. Yeah well because I'm getting the answer that I can't get an answer. That my definition of things about myself are existing anymore. And that I just have to accept that because. Well the idea is that you get to create from this point forward. And in the creation of yourself a new according to preference from this point forward. There may be certain connections to what you would call the past. But rather than searching them out simply allow them to come up for when they are coming up is relevant to what you are then at that time exploring. You will not be able to so to speak force that hand. But simply again through allowing and for in timing will find many connections that perhaps you are now perceiving from the perspective of attempting to get them to be lost. They are not lost. So they are simply irrelevant to this moment. Right. So in time I will have maybe a perspective again but it's not really relevant whether I have one or not. Well in a sense when you consciously choose to be the you you now prefer to be you will touch into that from the perspective of having resolved it. Does that make sense? Yes because I do flush away in and out of anger. Oh I am so rage even. Well anger is simply alignment and laughs and to 15 of your second. I suggest to you that beyond that 15 second mark you are strongly into invalidation and judgment about what you have just aligned yourself about. Right. So simply find where you are judging. Understand that judging is the assignment of unequal value. Remind yourself that everything is equal. Be willing to validate the things you do not prefer for that is what frees you up from them to begin with and allows you to release them. The judgment holds them firmly at your attention in place. And free which again? You lost me. When am I going to free? My value just? When you in a sense judge anything out of anger by invalidating it. Right. You hold it in place and empower it and place attention upon it. When you say alright this is not representative of who I am but I grant it the right and reason to exist perhaps for someone else. You release it. You release your attention from it. You release its effects on you. Judging something does not render it less and put it aside. It gives it more weight and brings it to the forefront. So allow yourself to use the anger. The anger is telling you this is me. This is not. If you stop at that point you are strongly defined in any given moment. You are defining who you are. If you proceed to say that the thing that is not me, states and has no reason to be there. You are judging and invalidating it and that is where the rage shall we say is experienced as rage. But you also ironically hold that very thing you judge in place. If you simply make the assignment that this is representative of who I am, this is not. Therefore I will choose what is representative of my own intention and purpose but not invalidate the thing that is not simply not place attention upon it. You release it. Does that make sense? Are you willing now to use your anger to align and then move on? Yeah. Watch now how your experience of it will change when you remind yourself and perhaps one of the reasons your society has coined the terminology count to ten. Is that that does give you a referential time frame? The sense is that I will see a connection in increasing depth in my own process if I release the anger. For that invalidation again, keep things that you do not prefer in the front which then so to speak of stewards of you. Okay, um, briefly on a different topic I am. All right, but exactly. That is useful. It is clear. I, I, I have to have your validation about it. Oh my, but when you hear what you perceive to be my, my, my validation, you ultimately are still doing the validating. So thank you. It's a big process. Oh, can be whatever side you are telling. Can be no process at all. It's so simple that I don't need in paradoxes. Well, that's part of the time. It's so good. It's things interesting. Yeah. Not boring. And, and it sort of mirrors the pattern of my life, but it's not totally externalizing itself anymore. So in other words, the experience wasn't like fondly or, or real in a sense. It was, it was more like a stage where I could almost manipulate the actors. I, I is now simply not relevant to who you are. Still exists within you. There's nowhere to put anything. All your outdated ideas still exist within you. For there is no outside to place them in. However, as you choose to act according to the things that you prefer, you in a sense distance yourself from these things that you do not prefer being relevant. To you and will not experience them any longer. Simply be aware of them as a concept. And again, perhaps many times see them in others. See these qualities I am releasing in others. For again, you will always be more aware as you expand a both positive and negative. The question is what do you wish to experience? Your willingness to choose from the positive perspective and act will only yield positive experience. Though because you are in an A reality of polarity, you will still be aware of the negativity. And again, many times it will be in the form of someone else and their story. So I don't know, I'm just too serious. I mean, I realize that it all comes down to one word, that's procession. That's like the key word of this whole incredible trip. That is quite credible, by the way. And perhaps another synonym would be point of view. Yeah. It's bizarre. Really people are. Oh. You seem to like that. I've been aware of this light outside my window. Am I experiencing another craft? Not next time. Is that a yes or a no? That is neither. It's a reason. You always get what you feel. So is it a star? It is for the purposes of explanation a recognition within. Of what? You tell me. Now that I am phrasing in that perspective, plug it in. Be active and tell me. What lights are going off within you? Oh, choice. Perception. Oh. Then that will be choice itself, which implies you always have another option. My daughter has been talking about, she's only for going on the spaceship in her dream. Is she having a more blatant type of interaction, yes? In terms of the specifics, she will tell you. Can you tell me what's out? No. That would in a sense interfere at this point. Does she say? It would narrow your focus rather than leaving it broad. And but is she safe? Absolutely. Oh, I don't need to worry. Well, that's up to you. If it's up to you, whether you will worry or not, will always be up to you. Will she always come back? Her choice is to be here, asthma. Is she teaching or being taught? Both. And that is always the case. So as you in a sense feel you are learning right now, you are teaching many others at the same time. I had two friends, and I'll be brief about both of them, that have come into my consciousness tonight strongly, so there must be a relevance. And I want to relate them to you. Number one. They both happened long ago, one was 17 years ago when I lived in Hawaii. And I was sitting out of each with somebody I just met. A very strong light went on. It was dark, it was nighttime. And we were in circles for about 10 or 15 seconds in a spotlight that went on and then went off and there was absolutely nothing when we looked up in the sky. What you were perceiving from our perspective is what you would call experimental governmental craft. It wasn't extraterrestrial? Not in that case. It seems to be just 10 feet over our head though. Not really. Wow, so it's the only... This and speed become quite arbitrary to judge in these cases. Did they mean to involve us or was it true? Well, perhaps from there and not you specifically. Was it sort of a helicopter type of craft or... I mean we heard no noise. We saw nothing above us. All that we are aware of, we have shared. A few years later, now I was on another island in Bali. I was on a beach alone and was walking and encountered a giant pair of footprints that were side by side and there was no other footprints leading to them. And I kind of had this awakening with a hair stood up on that side. And they were huge. Then we went and got a priest. Well, first of all, out of pure curiosity, what did the priest do? I was like, what did he do? He did a priest. Well, actually my friend went to a priest's master's advice and he said, make an offering. So my friend who was a Hindu got a Bali woman to make an offering and he went and took it to the footprints. Oh, that in a sense would be a direct representation of what you sometimes call Bigfoot consciousness in that sense as we had earlier shared. That other civilization race in a sense that will overlap often with your dimension. So very literally only when stepping in that spot was in your dimension and in the next step step back into their own dimension. I know this in a sense may not sit well, but that is the explanation that we all receive. Was there a purpose for my encounter again? For me. It is in a sense another connection to what you would call Lemoria. Does this have to do with my relationship with the Mayan at all? Lemoria as well? Kind of. So it's a sequential... Hey, but this would predate the Mayan experience. But that's a connection itself. Can you tell me more about that connection? There is in your satiety much literature available that if you will allow yourself to synchronistically attract, we'll answer many of these questions for you. When you are in that sense integrating this idea then perhaps we can expand. Always give you some homework. I like homework. Alright, home fun if you wish. Thank you. And to you. Good luck. Hey, it's Finayel. Lemayel. Are here all these about same life and spacecraft and all those things? You are not alone. Are there any other kinds of stuff that's being made just very specific to contact? There are many different styles of contact. Many of them are as this would appear telepathic in nature, but some of them are also blatantly physical. We have shared and it is available so we will be brief that there are physical interactions with a particular society that stands for the future. There are physical interactions with a particular society that stems from a system you call reticulum whereby individuals, physical, extraterrestrial individuals will interact with human, avoid physical craft. There are also in a sense, shall we say, some interactions with another society that does appear much as yourself as human in appearance, which will also in a sense from time to time interact with individuals directly in craft. Your government, or shall I say the government of the United States in that sense, is aware of the first mentioned one reticulum and in a sense has had some communication with them. Does that answer your question? Oh, no, I was talking about something directly, mind to mind. Well, as we had said at first, there is much telepathic communication between many civilizations at your own. Am I in contact with others? In a sense, I wonder why you are asking me, for you already know that to be so. I don't know exactly who it is. Well, ask. That is the point of having a direct line. If you are willing to, what you may sometimes perceive as, go out on a limb and ask, you will get the answer. It is your direct connection. For some reason, I don't get any answers. Oh, keep that. Be persistent. I assume the preferential, preferential you would not stand for anything less than getting the answer. Is this a matter of the time not being right? Yes. But that does not mean in any way that if you feel the urge to ask, that that may then not be the time it may be. Okay, I think what I really want to know is, am I talking to myself or is this being somebody else? The being, as you are describing, is someone else but seeks to you through you so in another sense you can say you are talking to yourself. It is both. The channel before you in that sense is involved in these interactions. So in one sense of the term you can say he is speaking to himself or his self is speaking to you. But in another sense, from my perspective, I am a discrete individual. I have a body. I have a life. As I have said, I have a craft, a space craft. So from my perspective, you are speaking to another individual, but through the model of the energy of this individual before you. So you cannot really remove him from the process. It is both. Does that make sense? Yes, would you be able to tell me more about this thing? What do you already know? I don't know if it's being from someone to planet or just being in guide or... Why would you think that it is a being from another planet? Because it's definitely different from me, separate from me, not me, for sure. Oh, you have answered your first question. It is a discrete another or other being. Now, you cannot remove yourself from the process where it is coming through you, but it is another being in that sense. You are fully aware of it. Simply validate, trust what you feel. That is what opens up the lines of communication, the trust. If, for instance, someone is speaking to you and you do not trust what they are saying, perhaps they will eventually get discouraged and go away. If someone is speaking to you and you trust what they are saying and use it, and move through and with the information that comes, then that compels the individual to then deliver more information. So are you willing to now begin to trust what you are feeling and understand that you deserve this and go forth? For some reason, I feel like I just had to wait until all of the time. That is the timing aspect. And that is how you will move. If you feel a hesitation, then simply move forth with what is available in your wants. Check in once in a while and things will simply be obvious. Allow them to be as obvious as possible. You need not complicate the matter. It is quite simple. That helps totally different subjects. Will you join your hands when you greet? That symbolizes honourings, other beings, where I grew up. Does it have any other significance in your society? Or is this something you do because you all are used to? It is in a sense both. It is in that sense, a gesture of the respect and honour as you have shared. In a sense, it is a universal greeting that does show in that sense that one is willing to respect and unconditionally love another being. But it is also in a sense perhaps can be perceived as the completion of a circuit, of the integration of what you would consider to be the positive and the negative. And functioning as a full being, not denying part or half of the reality you have chosen. Yes, that's my question. This is about evolution and trying to understand evolution. You are from our futures of our understanding. Well, in a sense. We are in a different time stream altogether, but we are used to live at time stream side by side with your own. It would appear that we are in the future. And you come to help us even to what is going to be. Well, in a sense, I am here to assist you in celebrating what you already are. There is no insistence to become something else. And as I have shared with you in the last interaction, we are not better than you. When you ask me, can you read my mind as an enhanced ability, yes or no, I answered yes because in a sense, yes, I can many times access your thought. But it is not because I am more involved that I do so. That was why there was a hesitation in answering that question. To factor what it is you truly were seeking to hear and in a one word answer, which is quite in a sense difficult in a sense. To render, I said yes. But it was not completely accurate in that this is not because I am more involved or better or contain parts of my body that you do not. It is simply that I function from the perspective in my consciousness of unconditional love. And when you are willing to love someone, no matter what, with no condition, you then can begin to identify with them. Identify as them and create similar thoughts at the same time. This is more accurately what telepathy is. Not literally reading someone else's mind, but becoming so identified with their vibration that the same thoughts are created at the same time. So when you are willing to unconditionally love in that way, you will then also begin to whatever degree to express the same ability. And it is not a physical evolutionary ability. It is a consciousness evolutionary ability, which you already have. Does that make sense? Yes. Exactly. And to continue that question, in that case, are beings from our society also going to our path to help them to what it is now? Well, in a sense, yes. And you can do this in the arena of your imagination. Project yourself in that imagination, back to what you perceive to be a past self and give them a little pat on the back. In a sense, that is what we are doing. Hmm. That makes sense. And I think we should be doing that even within our time, because there are different levels of understanding and growth, even on this one planet. We'll go right ahead. That would be quite a positive addition of positive energy, which would then contribute to the history in a positive way. You can also do this with your own child. Go back and visit yourself as a child. And encourage yourself. Please continue. Go right ahead. Where you are going is quite pleasant. And just last question, just a theory of the question, I would call it, but geographically, how big is your planet compared to ours? And is everybody at the equal level of growth on your planet? Equal level of growth in the way that you mean yes. In terms of the size of my planet, it is approximately 85% the size of your own, a bit smaller. But we are also located a bit farther from our sun. Hence our year, it is comprised of 454 of your days. Thank you very much. And over there. Hi. And who you? Great things. Oh, you should. And it's better that my car was on the way out and I created it and get something different. Having made a deal with a certain dealership, I still have my car. I drove to work. By the way, we all be vehicles. You do get around. There's one light now. It's got my burn. After I got bored about him as well, I was notified that it was on fire. Well, how exciting did you have a good car? I just wanted to light it in burn. There was no reason for it. I had it all set to go. And it just went up a smudge. In that sense, in what way do you perceive that you are pushing yourself to your level? I don't know if the district or the financial verb was a dealership. That is not what I mean. Perhaps we can cut through much of this. And particularly saying that the friction that you create, which perhaps may be perceived as resulting in overheating, is a result of the resistance of following the path of your country. That's what a battery blew. That is why, in a sense, you got that charge out of it. To simply remind yourself in no uncertain terms that there is something which still excites you that you have not acted upon. Okay. I want to work on that one. Well, you can't agree. But if you simply invoke it and begin to whatever degree you are able to act with integrity upon it, in what is available, you will simply change the moment. And I again suggest and refer you to your referential, preferential use, which I assume is driving around in the lack of luxury, in perfectly functional automobiles and motorcycle. Then if you read that value, you are unlikely to recreate that for them. How sound, the sound and this plane entails speed, which is time and space, does it in your realm also? In a sense, within the atmosphere of our planet itself. This will be somewhat, shall we say, insignificant in what you call the vacuous space. Yeah, I didn't mean that. I was just wondering, because if you were to, in that sense, visit my planet physically, you would perceive through the sense organs of your ears in much the way you already did. Though there may be some sounds you are hunting up in. I was just thinking, because sound and action takes up space, or is it just? We still do in that sense, embodying, and therefore, shall we say, experience many of the aspects of time and space, though our perception and creation of time is again at a different rate than your own. Okay, so actually, a sound, a sound, a little different here if we can hear it all. Well, it may, but it would depend. Things can also sound quite similar. Hello? A system of, well, let's call it a technique in chiropractic. This comes to my awareness, it's called network chiropractic. And it's come up to me through several sources, so I decided to make it inquiry. Oh, right, but before you proceed, I will not comment. If you will ask me, what are the extraterrestrial origins of that? I see. Therefore, as many times, I allow another question to replace that question. Well, being creative as I am. And sneaky. Irregardless of its extraterrestrial origins or not, my question is, do the SSI have healing techniques that would translate well? Not really. For that would imply the existence of disease to begin with, which we no longer choose to experience. Well, I'm interested more in maintaining balance. Well, perhaps again, even that is a perception that there is a tendency to become all-balance which we do not contain. So you're saying specifically that to achieve and maintain a state of balance, one really has to create that phenomenon from one's thinking and one state of being. Well, that is one, shall we say, perhaps one's removed way to look at it. If you simply do what excites you the most in any given moment with integrity, you have established perfect balance. I understand. So there are no techniques specifically that you'd like to channel through me. Interesting. Not myself. There are others who are willing. Thank you, today. Initiate this time. Attack myself. Notions. Up to you. It may speed things along. You have a name referenced. No. Thank you. And perhaps remaining a bit less focused than that will assist you. Do not again, as was mentioned, remove yourself from the process. Relative to Egypt, someone has said that I will meet two people that will facilitate part of my exploration over there. One older woman in a village scene in a dark skin's van. No. Okay. Relative to the temple of Hophor, do you have any more information for me on what I might experience, how I can facilitate that experience? Only in terms of there is a connection that you are sensing and there will be individuals present there that will assist you in that mind. Thank you. And is most of my work when you send it around the temple of Hophor, are there other locations that are written instrumental in unfolding my awareness of my knowledge? It is our perception that although there will be connections established that you may find in the totality of the particular exploration, that to be a simple footnote. There are connections that perhaps will occur more blatantly in what you call pyramidal. I have a sense that lasting functional dynamic relationships are going to begin on this trip, and I also have a sense that they're not all going to be terrestrial. Perhaps it would behoove you to find out by remaining focused, however, on the terrestrial interaction. Thank you very much. You will be attending with us. Oh, you would not miss us. I look forward to sharing with you there. Oh, have a good evening. And to you as well. One moment. There will be but a few moments remaining to this interaction. Hey, tonight. First I would like to thank you for your comments on the life being and processes should not be boring. Well, thank you. That is simply our approach. But it works. I have to do it with all of them. There are many that sent an impending major transition in our beloved planet. It is in full swing. Yes. A number of people have invited me to refer to specific dates in the future as being key dates where a transition will take place. Others have referred to more of an accumulated awareness key in the transition. Those that were referred to dates don't tend to agree on even particular decades. Could you comment on what exactly will trigger this transformation and could you give us kind of a human report card as to how we are doing? Well, first of all, again, I remind you that the transformation is already occurring. Not something about to happen. The way that it is experienced will be quite individual from individuals who are individuals. For being that perhaps you can say your reality is a neutral statement with no built-in meaning. Your assignment of meaning determines the effect you get out. You can, as we have shared, if choosing the positive perspective and only acting, only moving with that positive perspective, only experience the transformation in a positive way. If, on the other hand, you do choose to act from a negative perspective, you become of that vibration and then, shall we say, create a reality whereby you may be one of the individuals that can attract a more cataclysmic outcome. But you understand that the sensing that were interpreted and sometimes misinterpreted by many individuals were sensing nearly the change itself. Many times rendered from a time in your history where the only way any sense could be made of such change, the only way it could even be imagined that the structure could be changed was to first tear it down. Therefore, very often, the idea of change itself is interpreted through the only framework that made sense, that being that in order to have something build up anew, something must first be smashed down. That will differ and individuals will pick up on differing aspects of that energy depending on their own particular positive or negative orientation. What I can share, though, is that if you, as an individual, proceed as we have said, in positivity, in love and life, your entire experience of the transformation will be positive. If there are individuals who still do choose to remain negatively focused, your awareness of the negative transformation will only be as having happened to someone else. And you personally will only attract yourself to an area representative of the positive outcome. So even if, for instance, your own house were to be destroyed, you simply will not be in it when it is. Now we are not saying that it will be, but simply using that as perhaps a graphic example. When the, by the way, you all in our particular estimation get an A. For no matter what you choose, positive or negative, it will be a perfect manifestation of that choice. Therefore, A plus. Is there a, are we, in terms of that transformation as being a process, how far along that path are we? Fair question. Any question is clear. Whether I answer it or not is another national. But one moment. Approximately. And again, this is rather arbitrary. What you would consider to be one fifth the way they are. Thank you. In my meditations, I've been getting a lot of reoccurrences of the name Shambhala. And I have limited awareness of its applications in our history and have had little success in finding out more information in written records. Can you comment a little on the history of Shambhala and how it relates to Lemuria and Atlantis? And why am I suddenly getting an enormous amount of energy when I meditate on this? In a sense, for the purposes of being specific to you, that word would represent an integrated centered form of being. Period. Therefore, in particular, shall we say, areas of your history, this was demonstrated historically. However, it applies now, again, very closely to the question that you are asking, that your particular orientation and preference is to move through the transformation in a positive centered, intentionful way. Thank you very much. Anthony. Rosie. Real quick, we assume as we have chills, co-pills that come over our body, what is that exactly? It hasn't been many things, but very often, is a connection, is a recognition that you feel to the core of your being, an alignment, so to speak. Oh, that's it. I mean, that's pretty important. Is that not enough? No, that's great. I've always wondered that, because it happens to me a lot. In general, whatever you are viewing at that time is most representative of who you choose to be. So, in short, data view, what we call data view. That is different. Can you go on? So, you may then have the effect you have shared after having that, but data view in general will represent having blue printed a particular scenario in what you call your sleeping dream reality, which you consistently do, but in general with no awareness. And in the moment, in that sense that you do create a connection, you have in a sense blue printed it before, and in that moment are simultaneously in the moment you are perceiving, but also experiencing the moment you blue printed it. It is an expression, or one of the expressions, of the simultaneity of your being in practice and experience, many times that will then yield from the alignment of the aforementioned chills. Okay. Thank you. And to you. At this timing. Thank you. Got it in there. You want to? Allow me to thank you all for creating within something which shall we say already existed. But now you are placing attention and intention upon that preferential preferential. This is a tool that again you cannot lose. If you are to never attend an interaction such as this again, a gift has been bequehed upon you that allows you to achieve the same effect. Therefore use it when you will. It will never fail you. And again, it is quite obvious that in a given situation, two sets of actions will obviously result in two different outcomes. If you are always providing a positive alternative position, it will be most easy to choose it for it is representative of who you prefer to be. And you will create a momentum that will allow you to continue to be this preferred you that you already are. You are that you make no mistake about it. It is now up to you to continue to create that you to recreate and recreate that preferred you. Whatever you choose, we will love you no less. And do unconditionally love you all. And express to you our gratitude and appreciation for your willingness to bless us with your presence. Which are multi-dimensional, infinite and eternal. We thank you and bid you a most fond and loving. Life dream and dream life and good evening.
