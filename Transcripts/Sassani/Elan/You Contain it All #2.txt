 Before we continue, allow me to first of all say that the entitlements of the next interaction at this location will be positive and negative synchronously. This will allow us to delineate upon certain results that you get in your life as well as explain a general concept which will be of service to you. But we will also pay some attention to the manifestation of negative synchronously for everything is always synchronously and this we shall discover. Before again we proceed, allow us first of all to say, many of the structures upon your planet, what you refer to as sociological, political, economic, religious structures. Contain within them one particular concept which in a sense maintains a very distinct line of separation between individuals and groups upon your planet. And that is the simple concept that this is the only way. In the understand that as long as an ideology continues to not only be what it is and provide an alternative but purports to be the only way thereby assuming all other ways and valid and should be annihilated, you will probably still continue in that sense to experience what you call warfare, separation and segregation. As you begin to introduce the idea on whatever level you are able and willing that in fact always are a valid way and not the only valid way, you begin to perform a service which again is an integrative service upon your planet. Or again is the recognition that always are valid, that your way is just as valid and that when one in that sense completes the cycle of the usefulness of one particular way can then automatically attract the next quote unquote way that will newly now represent where an individual is at. So to the degree that you are willing individually to embody this level of acceptance, this level of willingness to validate realities which do not match your own, the more you make a very visible impact upon your planet for there are simply not many examples of this attitude. In that sense we'll always begin somewhere and each and every one of you are an opportunity or a way to express that always are valid, that you may find that your way is beneficial, you may find that your way will assist many people but it is never the only way. And as you can get your version of this across, again it makes an impact and provides an example which is again very rarely seen at least at this point upon your planet. Always are truly valid for you literally you contain them all. And when I say you contain it all I mean everything. I also remind you that you can only perceive something if you first contain it. So when you perceive joy you contain it. When you perceive assistance you contain it. When you perceive connectedness you contain it and you can begin in that sense to pat yourself on the back rather than ascribing to external sources the ideas which enable you to continue to grow and expand according to preference. For it is always you that makes the decision because you contain it and only does it make sense to you because you first contain it and from all the things that you contain you are simply now being a bit more selective in which you will express. As you express the positive again you make a statement. You cause as when you toss a pebble into one of your pawns ripples that at first seem insignificant and eventually then envelop the entire. You are such ripples you are such pebbles. Each one of you do make a difference and each one of you do contain it all. By containing it all and allowing everyone else to also contain it all you then begin to exhibit through acting what you call inner piece of mind and as you embody this individuals can see well look at this individual their way is different than mine but yet they do not forsake my way and since I am not on the defensive because they are forsaking my way I can actually see their way and it's not so bad. You will make an impact but only through your willingness to apply in action which is what upon your planet is perceived by others not the words the actions therefore in that life I once again thank you and ask you how I may be absurd. My three questions oh the session we had at the end of October you were talking about you had a very entertaining way to get us to ask about the new year that was coming and you then explained that for the next four months from November 15th through March 15th it was going to be a much heightened the level of energy on the planet and that certainly from my vantage point has been quite true it appears that that was by no means mean that it must end at that period but that is a particular game to do proofing. It seems to be accelerating a heightened awareness of the polarities that we've been discussing. That is what gives you back the power from truth from not being unaware of them but for when. Can you comment on how the planet is perceived by your hopes and others as to how we're reacting and how we're gearing with these heightened levels of energy. Thank you. Our perception is very strongly positive for we understand that only could many of the issues which have been kept in your collective closet or under your collecting carpet if you will now are coming full force to the certain again many of the things which have remained hidden in shame and guilt within your society are now simply commonplace on your daily television allowing all individuals to begin to look at the very things not only individually but collectively that represents the things that have been denied to this point. So therefore we see a strong degree of acceleration which again will bubble up many times in both positive and negative manifestations but in the very process the existence of the willingness for the process itself we are greatly encouraged for but a few months perhaps even years ago upon your planet such a thing would not have been allowed by the mass and especially with this accelerative moment so therefore we see great progress. When I was reading the newspaper a couple of weeks. You can all applaud yourself. Just to comment that when I was reading the newspaper a couple of weeks don't really extraordinary scale of destruction that's currently taking place. I just got an extraordinary wave of impression that in fact things that the entities watching over us were greatly encouraged and in fact I was getting the message that things were going in fact very well and that the current level of destruction that is taking place will not continue internally. Well why did you laugh? You seem to have it all. I guess I was just looking for a little confirmation. Oh and you have a second question I want to ask. Every time when you come into the channels body you hold your left hand. Oh I am not by the way literally within the body but make use of a model of energy laid down by you. I would I'm curious not to be very curious. What if there are any similar things holding your finger back when you are the energies are starting to blend. Oh thank you. First of all you will understand this to occur on what you call the left hand which will correspond to what you generally colloquially refer to as right brain activation. The symbology of the fourth not the third finger will in that sense represent very literally fourth density infusion so to speak upon a third density model. Nearby when the entire shall I say connection is complete then will complete the circuit from both. Yes and then you finish up as you just about to take full control with your hands in a triangular shape. Right. Again the completion of the circuit is so to speak. The integration of both not simply utilizing one half colloquially again of the brain or the other but one complete expression yes polarity is existing but expressed as one unit. Thank you. My last question was something very unusual again happened to come in the hypnagogic. I woke flat on my back which I am country wise so vulnerable to the hypnagogic when I'm speaking on my back but I woke, saw with my either imagination or I witnessed a goose on my headboard that felt like it had the essence of my beloved daughter cat. The goose then walked across my face not painfully but just make sure it had my attention and then curled up next to me on the bed and I was able to reveal it see it hear it smell it and I was I haven't I spent the last few weeks trying to figure out what the symbology of the goose was and haven't gotten any clear answers I had a sense that it may have represented prosperity but I'm not sure and then immediately after that I heard a very young boy playing just just stripping along over my left shoulder just out of eyesight. Can you offer any? Very simple. First of all swan not loose. This will again represent sometimes what you refer to as the ugly duckling scenario though we do not mean this personally but the idea is the unfoldment into your totality being at hand and perhaps also you will find certain golden eggs to come forth. In terms of the child you are simply again connecting with what you call the inner child to the point where it is now becoming accessible closer to the surface in that way. In terms of what you call your supine or lying on your back position this will then enable you to be most neutral keeping the head straight and also in that sense colloquially speaking facing colloquially speaking the heavens in a sense the reinforcement of the spiritual connection. And also on a more shall I say nothing both level allow for what you call proper or shall I say full nerve and blood flow. Oh thank you. Shutting. Lay. Good evening. And please. Well on the subject of first we have done a complete 180 just a last hundred times. This is pretty is done. Now are you telling me you have changed your mind. Oh no. Oh. Oh. What is the question. I've gotten what you did on. That's it. Well what else can you. What. What is that. I mean simply your reality is responding to your practice. And it also again does represent certain things that you have reconciled within yourself. Now will you share with me what that might mean. In terms of what you have recently reconciled and I assume you do know what I mean. Because the last time you just talked about what he was doing was openly working out my enders. Well allowing an outflow for it that may be less immediately shall I say negatively resulting to you. Well I set down one day from the same period of time and concentrated on where the enders came from and what they were directed towards and came some results. I don't remember exactly what they just as is. But it was going to tell this stuff. It was around the same time within a few days when I brought to the vet. Now you will always have the opportunity to utilize the vet as the symbol but it is in general from our perspective the change in the attitude that resulted in that particular result. So therefore again your animal consciousness which is reflective very clearly reflective consciousness is now in that sense representing how you have redefined yourself. Oh thank yourself. You have done it all. One more. Is that all? That's all. All right. Hey. Greetings. And to you. I am following my excitement as recently brought in the financial abundance to continue with all my excitement. All right. One more. Is everyone listening up? This is what you colloquially refer to as a testimony I will allow. I throw that in. The answer is your idea. Well perhaps unplug them but we understand. The form that is coming is a consulting contract that seems to be very much like what I've been visualizing in my meditation. A two month contract working for something that I really like. And the question that I have is I'm not really sure if this is exactly what I want to be doing right now. I feel I think it might give me some time to do what I really want to what I feel like I want to do which is to write a paper on global transformation. It has occurred in response to your request. It will always be up to you to take up the offer or not. But you understand that this is one of the way within your excitement that you have created a particular scenario that will allow you a space of time. Yes. It's giving me some time. The reason that I haven't been writing the paper yet though is because I'm wondering if I'm coming from a place of it being truly my excitement and I know we discussed this once before but it still comes back to me as a question. Am I coming from my excitement or am I coming from an old place of security and wanting to have people like me for having, you know, being smarter, having good ideas or something like that. Almost accurately there is a bit of both in there but you may understand that you do have a desire to be of assistance. And our particular desire to also be of assistance, again, perhaps began your paper with the opening of this half of the interaction in terms of allowing individuals to present their way as a way, not the only way, one of the major impediment to global transformation at this point. Okay. Well, that brought, when you were talking about that I had a question relating to the paper that I want to write, that the major economic paradigm is the kind of bequaced economic growth with the increase in social welfare, which I think that that's flawed because it doesn't account for environmental and social costs. So can you offer another alternative governing economic theory to the market theory and tell us how our government might implement it? Well, again, there is nothing unsound about the market theory itself. It is simply the orientation and attitude through which people flow through that system. In general, they flow through that system at a sense of obligation, at a sense of everyone else defining their reality for them. It truly boils down to doing what excites you the most in the moment with integrity within that structure. Well, when individuals are acting not only from their excitement, but from the knowingness of their integrity, all these systems actually can work, where the systems quote unquote seem to break down or hang up, is in the functioning and performing of the system in the way that it is according to, again, the obligation rather than the excitement. There is no need for welfare for there is no one out of a job when individuals are doing what excites when they in that sense buy into what others say they should be doing and truly do things that are not representative of who they are, then yes, it is far more simple in that sense to quote unquote through synchronicity, lose the job you wish you didn't had in the first place and then allow yourself in that sense to set up an elaborate social arrangement through governmental need. But if individuals begin to be aware of their excitement in that way, there is no longer this phenomenon occurring. Individuals generally will not withhold themselves from the performance of exciting things. So perhaps in and of itself, what I would suggest as an addition to any system is the excitement orientation. Then again, you need not have the perspective that one system is the way and all others are invalid. They are all valid, all equal explorations and all can be equally beneficial by the allowance of the other systems and also the expression of the excitement through the aforementioned existing system. The thing I know to understand is how can you have multiple points of view in one governing system? For example, the United States is a blatant shall I say example of. What I would say is that our corporate structure forces corporations to focus almost exclusively on short term profits at the expense of everything else. This year, all those demand that if the CEOs don't put short term profits ahead of the environment, the work and relations, community relations, they will be fired and replaced with someone who will. Okay, but already what you are describing to me are individuals functioning through obligation at the cost of excitement. So you have not introduced excitement into that structure and framework. That is the nuance. That is the new argument. What you are speaking of as this urgency would simply transform when individuals get about the task of the exciting thing. But the corporations are owned by kind of Facebook shareholders that only care about a financial return. And those are the people who tell the corporation only go after profits. How can we, the people cause our government to change that? They can only do so with the structure already in place who will obey those wishes, even if those wishes are at the cost of the individuals integrity. So again, we speak of excitement but with integrity on an individual basis. At the beginning in the way that your structure is laid down, that may actually wind up presenting many people quitting their job. But the idea is that when you as an individual will not settle for lack, you will attract yourself into a situation whereby you can express through your excitement in what you are calling an economic setting. This sets up again new examples, new nuclei that then allow the larger structures to see look not only are they having fun but they are making just as much money in the process. But you need to start in that sense somewhere to at least provide an alternative. Much of what you are sharing is again due to the knowledge or belief that there is no other way and they are absolutely. So seeking to function out of your excitement or seeking to function unless your integrity is in place will then automatically shake your reality up, perhaps relocate you to where you then can express that and still at the same time draw abundance and draw But how can I decide if this in the argument that I should be writing this paper? More specifically i guess I… Do you desire to be absurd? Yes or no? Yes or no? Why? Because that seems to be what excites me when I watch TV and see people that are suffering in third world countries and here I feel that I have intuitive knowledge that could be incorporated into political structures. Now you sound like he believes it. So where does the notion that it may simply be you striving for attention even in that or into that? Because that's something I've done in the past and I'm wondering if I could go to that yet. Well have you? Sometimes I don't think so. Right now as we are speaking have you? I don't think quite because I feel a little nervous right now. Well that can again perhaps be the excitement with the slight negative edge on. My perception is that you are doing it for the quote unquote right reasons using your own terminology. Now there will be automatically some recognition in this but it does not strike me so to speak as your underlying motivation. But anything I can say is simply arbitrary. It is what you choose to believe and only you can come to this conclusion. Okay. A lot of times I'm applying your concept of doing what I love and often that makes me feel very joyous in the moment. However there are times when I'm unhappy and I can't figure out what I must be believing to create that unhappiness. For example, today I was talking with the dear friend who's a real Bible-thumping Christian and he was hopeful. I really believe in sin and the judgmental God and everything and I wanted to do what you said which is honor his point of view and love him for whatever he is but I found myself feeling defensive and kind of almost getting argumentative with them about it. Oh I left the conversation feeling unhappy. Well that is a prime example however of where you are and it is an example to decide and look at all right. Interesting. I got defensive. What a surprise. Where is this hanging up? Where do I not believe where I am saying? Is it obvious to you at what point you did not believe what you were saying? I don't know. I seem to believe what the concepts that you espouse completely but there must be some place of doubt inside of me. Yes and where is that and again doubt is not a lack of trust. I think the doubt comes in from the fear that one of the people will think of me if I just pass these concepts. Now if you are only willing to remain positive what's the worst they could think of you? Oh, DC's roof rose colored glasses. The idea is that you have performed a service. There is still some to some degree underlying idea that what you are saying is perhaps better than what he is doing. Yes. Now that is all right. Only can you again remind yourself of the equality of all realities by at least acknowledging that you do still contain that. So therefore simply re-acknowledge, re-member, re-collect if you will that it is all right for him to think that and that the point was not to turn him around and that him turning around or not turning around. There is not any commentary on the power of your idea. It is simply his willingness to take the gift that you have done and do with it whatever. And if it reinforces his point of view, understand you have still been of service to simply not according to your point of view but still no less of service to you. How do I love him and feel comfortable being with him when I can see that his belief system is causing a pain? As all that is so allows you to explore anything, simply emulate that perspective. Again providing where possible a loving alternative with no interest. And then being a living example once again of what you are speaking of he is not blind and will eventually see that it is working for you and then perhaps ask you some questions. But the harder you push the more a defense goes up and the defense isn't a receptivity to anything at home and therefore does not allow what normally might be considered as sound ideas by him to even get in. Therefore your willingness to not insist, your willingness to simply state with love, with peace in your tone is the greatest opportunity that he will even get to look at. So simply now approaching him from this perspective, incorporating what you felt and reminding yourself that what he believes is completely equal and he had the completely equal right to explore his perfect version of whatever misery he is creating. That is again his choice. And that is part of the validation of which we speak also then allowing you from your point of view in beginning to view global transformation to express individual transformation and once again saying I have a way you may wish to use that it has certain advantages but it is not the only way in your way as justice value. Thereby beginning global transformation in one particular interaction between individuals. I am involved. I am just going to the spiritual group near where I live. This led by a woman who I admire who has been teaching this stuff for 20 years but one of her beliefs causes me a little discomfort and I want to ask you about it. Well very interesting how could verbally cause you to do something? I guess I wasn't sure if it was true or not. Well then it is not and you get to choose but do put. Okay she talks about negative spirits or disembodied negative spirits or entities that we can only if you first vibrate at the same rate. Therefore your perspective is a positive loving unconditional individual yet these energies exist again you cannot deny within polarity that extreme manifestations of negativity exist. However if you are the prime positive action example they cannot find you. They cannot see you so unlike argument. Okay so it is not a matter of denying you contain it all remember. It is simply a matter of choosing what will be relevant to you and if you are positively oriented negative beings are irrelevant to who you are. Therefore literally we will see not to exist in your reality. Okay she says things like bringing up your golden pyramid over here or something like that can protect you from it but that seems to me the protection is again setting up for the attack which is the same as setting up the attack and again fear of a negative entity is perhaps you can take a fancy way of saying that you feel it is most likely that you will attract one. So fear is an opportunity to see what you must believe being that it as well is an emotion. My concern with being in this group then is I don't want to buy into the belief system that I will be attached by negative entities. Well how could you? On the contrary you can actually be a grounding example of the refusal to divide into that thereby giving other individuals both choices without insisting or invalidating her choice. So again another opportunity to globally transform to individual interaction. My question was does the group a safe place for me? Have you heard what I have said? Then yes? Okay. Every place is safe for you. Nothing can get you. You are everything. Therefore even if something was seen to get you it is you creating getting yourself which is just generally another fancy way of saying delivering a message which you have refused to receive. So simply be open to receiving all the messages that all your emotions deliver and you will never create that type of attack. And never need fear it and again if you do trace the emotion of that fear back to the belief, acknowledge that belief provide the alternative and act and move according to the alternative. Thank you. One of the things in the past that I did from the place of insecurity was compare myself to other people a lot and build myself up by putting other people down and stuff in my mind and by comparing my mind. It worked by the way, did it? It sure did make me happy. Oh and that's why I want to let go of it. Well you just congratulations. I'm not simply continuing to do so. But that continued to do so. I mean the reason I brought it up is because after this point it seems like it's sneaking in on me. I'll catch myself comparing myself to someone and say why are you doing that again? I don't want to do that. I know I'm equal to this person. External don't matter. There's no, you know, I don't want to get caught up in saying I'm better or worse than you are resolving it and as it comes up in handling it will soon obliterate the necessity for having it continue to come up. Simply continue to handle it from that perspective instead of seemingly circum. Understand? Oh, we've saved. Perhaps we can share again but for the purposes of involvement we will now cease at this point this interaction. And again thank you for your willingness to open many doors not only within yourself or many individuals present was I speaking to in answering your question. And thank you. Shut up. You may. It's a question for Fred and my Mary. You've got a book that she was wrote in your press line. I'm not fair enough to let a few requests in her are either familiar with the book. Behold the deal for us. No, do describe. It's once I heard Mary. So it's most like can. As it came to her she talks about our government knowing about the only making every you must have come like this. They go making their dream with the day to abduct people. And shall I say to a wow those types of co-created interactions to take place. The entertainment of sorts. The reason. Well, in a sense. Only in a loose that is that one way to describe the shall I say and bow empowered body that has made that agreement, but it is only very loose. You are ultimately your government. So therefore you are still the source. The system of the international. The society. Really. International. The society. I am one of the question. The best. There are various shall I say connections of individuals. Some of them may seem to present in this way, but they pose no threat to who you are and what you are. And in a sense are in many ways buckling in under their own way. I do remember when she said about the book she said staircase was killed by the CIA by the last other movies. That is not in the alien sense our perception. There was knowledge, but that was not our perception of the reason. Do these authors of the book one Cooper said the driver of the. No, not from our perspective. There were perhaps other sources of what you would call the bullets, but not the drawings. Not from our perspective. Because you are on that jubilant film. Oh, again, it is our perception that it is not. This is for me. I am following my statement and giving my masters to free and cast. Oh, how is. Yeah, using what I've learned from being disabled. And re-able, but do you perceive. And one person I see right now is a cancel rolling tin. And I feel that she and I have connections beyond this life. Oh, absolutely. But the connections for now most strongly lie within the re-empowerment, the taking back of your power under all circumstances in this life. Is that all? Yeah, thank you. Oh, thank you for your willingness to boldly share. It is our joy. Shut it. It is our joy. Oh, thank you. Oh, you're welcome. It is nice to talk with you again. Oh, and others. I have something that I did this once before. I asked something that was very embarrassing to myself. And so I am about to be so dear. Well, how is the lighting? Are you blushing? Yeah, probably am. I've been thinking about this question, which I will reveal in a moment, as you've been speaking with the other people. And I think I know I'm turning this around in my mind, but it's a situation that involves finances. Over the past several years, I've had real financial difficulties. And at one point, then it was the time, actually, when I came into this group, I really didn't have a place to live. And that lasted for some months. And I realized that I'm creating these situations and these lack, you know, this feeling of lack, and especially a lack of money. And I would like your help in maybe just taking another step with this as I look at how I want to change this. Oh, first of all, have you been, as we have discussed, allowing your abundance to come another form? I heard that suggestion of yours. Yes, but we are speaking about using it. And the idea is the willingness to do so is a posture of unconditional acceptance. The posture of unconditional acceptance, the polarity of unconditional receptivity or acceptance, is matched by the universe as unconditional giving. So therefore, when you place rigid conditions, they are in that sense maintained from the other end. And the rigid condition is I will only allow the money to be the way to deliver this methodology, then that's what you get or perhaps don't get as fast as you may wish. But when you begin again to expand the definition and allow it to deliver in the many ways, then you begin to create an unconditional acceptance, which is matched with again many coincidences, seemingly delivering beyond your expectation. Well, that is step one. Step two would be once again to call your attention to whatever limiting beliefs that you contain about individuals who already have money. Or if they are interpreted by you in a negative way, there is the built-in contradiction of the beliefs whereby you want something but may feel the cost of getting it would be the cost of yourself or your integrity. So that will be the next step. Is that clear? Are you still blushing? I'm thinking about what you're saying. Am I blushing? No, no. Good. Perhaps you have re-centered. At the session at Prime Nander, when I was telling you how I didn't like to hold brochures and things and do that part and how that felt so yucky or overwhelming to me, the woman next to me volunteered to do some nailing for me. And in fact, she did do them. And I really like her and I think she's really intelligent and that was a real gift at that point. Well, instant manifestation. You will often begin to see more of it. But it takes having the notion and boldly putting it out for duty. Now you can see how quickly the universe delivers. I feel like you had a great part in that since I feel what you stimulated that. Well, great part, perhaps, meaning as an act towards race. Thank you very much for your part. So I need to, I'm going to take these two steps. The first is, I forgot what the first step is. Allowing your abundance to come in whatever way, no matter what, that will still enable you to do what you need to do. Exercising your ability to do what you need to do when you need to do it without resinsizing the way that we insist that it must come in monetary form. Number two, again, is to accept how you feel or the negative feelings that you sometimes create about what money does to one and how one with money than after. But that will keep you busy. No, that will keep you busy. Over there. I want to ask another question. You were sharing with Jim about swimming. I could have lost a vision lately when I do meditations and actually lose the dream and I'm awake. Here it comes. And so I've been having visions of going in other dimensions and being with Divas and Faerie and actually being myself sort of looked like me but I look a little different. I have longed-down hair and I just look different and I have a bigger chance to start like this. I'm not. And I'm living a dream. And I'm being a healer and I have urns and I talk to the animals and they compare me. So this has been going hard and I've been with elves and a meritan elf and I have chubby. It's just going to be on and on. And then today I had a vision of doing the same thing except this time I was swimming in a lake upon actually the beginning. And it was incredibly beautiful. It wasn't just swimming. It was something ritualistic about it and it felt so incredible. And I had all this emotion about it. You were simply fully involved in interacting with us. And what you ascribe as ritualistic is simply our full 100% commitment in each moment to that moment and to the act that we are performing. So therefore it may heal ritualistic because the same dedication is there but this is consistent throughout our life in every moment. It looks like how I would picture you look. In general, individuals will bring back memories of us as either being human since you do act within us or with us in that state as equals then that is your idea of equality. But also there may be other forms as well for we are more slight in the spectrum. I know it looks like little elves. I mean, I can't. That's great. So then I get out of the water and all these beings and robes and they put a robe on me and said, I need to go with them. So I went with them to the path of their power and I made those down and made noise with me. And they were like, it looked like the Senate masters, to me, that's how they felt to me. And they gave me a book and told me it was Time Now. It's a big beautiful old book. And they said it was Time Now for me to remember and use this knowledge. And I said, thank you very much, can't go out and play again. I'm so out of love. I'm so out of love. I'm so out of love. I'm so out of love. I'm pushing upon the grounding where these ideas then become practical in this reality after you have had that form or they are applicable. It felt that way when I was meditating, I wasn't. Out of my body, I was in fact thinking into the earth. My legs was thinking into the earth. I was fully embodied. I was not bleeding. So it was more of a physical, I could feel these, I could feel the energy in me and through me. Hey, but the lesson in there, the being pulled into the earth is again the regrounding itself. So how do I, okay, so then how do I, you're gonna tell me that in my fall and my statement, aren't you? Anything but that. But, which is the book, is there anything specifically in that book? I have a feeling that some, like, large pieces of knowledge are just gonna like come and transcribe through me. I think to some degree you will find many pages, simply from your perspective it will not know the difference. LAUGHTER Oh, my all-piece? They're consciousness. There's no fit in the name. Well, perhaps you will tap into that, but there is no need to apologize. LAUGHTER You can't, you can't, wait. I'm wait. OK. OK. That's true, describing. Another name. Oh, thank you. Another name came through. Oh, so then, wait, this one I was saying. It was, I haven't had the proof of business. I remember when Ron here, she has little out the earth and everything. I went to this store with this woman makes and deavers and elves and she gets visions and makes and I go and guess what was in this store. This big doll has long gone here, was better than her hair, and she lives in the tree. And I'm cherry-blocked in trees. And she has big chest. I can't, it's wrong. And so, I couldn't believe it. I'm listening to stuff. Well, obviously, you could believe it. Why, I couldn't believe it. So, I told the woman the story and she knew I was a healer and I told her I was gonna put this all in my hair and the woman, she was very excited and I told her all about my vision. She gave me perhaps, right? Well, that is, I think, we're in this. So, I have her, and I actually feel that she has energy because she's not just a dog. And then I got a new name today and I think it's the dog. And what name is my name and what is the name? Well, what is the difference? What is the name? The name is Alantra. Oh. And I don't know. That's, that mean, it just kept coming to me and is that with either my name or, no, no. Well, how exciting. We will find it. I know. Hey. What is this interesting? I don't know why all these visions are coming in the form of nature spirits in the pan and. Well, they are simply a representation of your willingness to remain connected and no longer feel separated. You are literally one not only with your reality but with what you would call your planet, your elements, your element holds. Oh, right. Yeah, and it's also knowing that it's not different from this reality that there's no separation, right? It's all the same. Right. OK. Thank you. Thank you. Shut up, you're on. Male. You said that this information that we're all getting has been sent to us in a chunk or a block at once. When you will interact with us directly, we do not speak our language and therefore will, in general, interact in what you referred to as chunks or blocks of information, which you will then, at your own pace and your own comfortable timing, then allow the translation of which to come over a period of time. When did that block get sent for me or any of us? Which block? Which block? Well, I took this as, when we spoke of this before, that this my whole life, beginning to end, at this life, was that the block, that the chunk. That is not what we meant, but that is also true. So the information from you is saying that a specific timing in your recent, shall I say, presentation and is, even as we speak, even in the sense of you asking the question, beginning to unfold. But in an interactive way, interactive with what you consider for now to be external to me. So when I first physically started companies channeling, the information is, no, I don't. What we are speaking of the most recent. Only was the allowance by you made most recent. Yeah. Yes, I understand that. We thank you. I thank you. I thank you. I love you. I love you. First I just like to say thank you for being such a loving and wise, my self-discipline is so beautiful. Well, thank you for wording it, Montville. No. Another thing was, we've been trusting that she was talking about the day that I'm furious. A couple of years before I had an experience where I saw a theory. And there was just so much joy and lightness and people you're about her and everything. And it was when I was really exploring the day that can make your kingdom. They will always present themselves when in love and trust you request the interaction, where they are to treat energy. Yeah, because I want that to come around me. I feel it. I want that closeness. Perhaps you are taking the idea that there is a difference between feeling it and being it. When you feel it in that moment, you are sharing it. There was no need to see it. Oh, need? Oh, beautiful. And the other thing I would just like to ask you, how may I serve you? Well, you already have. And always, by simply being willing to be who you are and interact in this way. That is of service to me. Hearing your individual perspective is of service to me. In understanding that much more about creation allows me to expand the definition I have of myself. Or I understand creation from my perspective is within. Therefore, you assist me in defining myself, still perfect. The greatest of gifts that one can render. We thank you. You should. In line. Say, no. Go on, Norman. Not you. OK, sorry. Over to me. Yeah. Excuse me. Hey. Hey. In line, I appreciate this opportunity to speak with you that first time. We were talking about the sleep state and about dreaming. And I wanted to ask a question about coma. I have a brother who's been in a coma for over four years. And I believe that he is in this state because he needs to receive unconditional love. He sometimes appears to me in dreams where he is awake and I experience the joy of this awakefulness. Hey. And that is a distinct interaction representative of the intersection of your and his consciousness. OK, good. I'm about to go back to where, close to where he is in Canada and see my family, but I won't be able to see him in this recent trip. I am facing with my family this ongoing struggle where I believe he should stay alive until he is ready or gives the signal to leave, but they feel a decision should be made to have him depart this earth. Will I receive a communication through my dreams when he is ready to go or shall I give into this family decision? Perhaps if you wish to in that way pose this question, you may wish to be a little bit more active and dialogue with him consciously in your meditative state. Or you will get feedback. You will make a connection. And much of what we are discussing will simply become plain and obvious. OK. Thank you very much. Oh, thank you. Thank you, people. Thank you. And welcome down now and please join me again in the future. Thank you very much, we see you very much. See you next time, the last session in Tamil Tilgh ya, you just you know, like the beginning of the pursuit of my heart going into this country. It happens to my heart that another airplane can come upon me from far after me taken away by the gently higher power of my heart wont me Hu is to stop me from my heart going into this starting space and follow trance that might be where not in existence before me and my heart cannot You know, this talked. Now if we were Yearning in the closed world, you know, getting theets that but further you'd love you to know that it matters full, it should see you know, in reflection within that soul, not the other way around the soul, that's not trapped in the body. The body exists within the consciousness. And simply from one point of view, you may understand, that simply has he close the eyes of his soul that corresponds to the physical point of the body and simply open them elsewhere, which from the perspective of the body seems out of the body. But it is simply relocating within the totality of his consciousness. But again, indirectly dialoguing much will simply become evident, or he has an opinion on this. Oh, thank you. Oh, and you. Should I? I had similar thoughts. I always wondered the question that Jim asked about your sending a chance. I was wondering, do you know in advance what kind of questions I'm going to have or thoughts? How do you know in advance? There will sometimes be the idea of perceiving a particular orientation. But far more will it fall into from my end just the synchronicity, my having the notion that this is to be communicated corresponding with that exactly being the question that you are asking. That is truly the more generally applicable mechanism that occurs. It is complete synchronicity. And when in that sense, and again, this is quite colloquial. Do not picture large chunks of concrete coming into your mind. But the idea is when a complete concept is delivered, and you then break it down along the timeline to translate it, when you are through midwifing it into your reality, again in the form of action, not speaking to everyone about it, that allows me then to deliver the next concept. So somewhat then is the timing determined by your willingness to apply what has already been transmitted. So you do have in that sense part and parcel of the process itself. But many of the specific questions again are on one level perhaps you can say anticipated, on another level complete coincidence. And does this happen both ways? So I also maybe do the same thing. Well we do have the ability to tap into discrete moments or again extract again. Perhaps you can say in the reverse direction a complete concept, which I will then also then translate, and it is relevant to me in my reality, which may or may not be in one city or standing. So does that make sense? To me that makes more sense because I think it should be, or again I don't know what other words you use in being individual to still wish to maintain what you call a degree of privacy. And we respect this for in general it is not a concept that we are now exploring. Since we are completely telepathic there is the idea of privacy and the possibility for it's desire, but in general it is simply not something we designed. However we respect your particular creation of it and therefore interact in that way. By providing the information being of service and perfect timing, but without treading on any toes. I had exactly opposite in mind I did want you to know a lot of stuff. I do wish for you to know and I'm wondering. But when you wish for me to know it I simply did. Is it directly or through my future? Well in the way that you mean directly. It is synchronicity in that sense of forward this it may actually come through the future self at some time. But it will the effect will be the same. I will know it when I need to know it in order to then reintegrate and re-interact with. Because I do feel like I have a lot to contribute. Well you absolutely do. You hold. And this is something again that we do not take lightly. Well perhaps in one sense of the word we do. Actually that brings me to something else that I have been thinking of this evening. I don't know where it came from but I was wondering. I have been in touch now. Now obviously since you contain it all you know where it came from but do go on. I was thriving and it is just part of it and I thought it is too strange a question to ask what I am. No such thing. We like. I am going to exercise it a little further anyway. I was thinking about child. Okay let me say this first. I have been in touch with many many entities in last. Whatever maybe two years. And I felt I suddenly realized I have never come across a child. Where are all the children? How come everybody is in idle? I mean I know they are they were children at some point but I am thinking about this union seems to be to have all the idols. Or at least they. They have. We tap into that idea. They are there. They have the same ability. They are in general very as you say present time conscious. Do not in general participate in these interactions in the way that we do but they are accessible and simply it will require about the request from your end. I think I am thinking more about ending of the childhood and since like we. When I say we are in everybody people on different planets also spend more time being an artist and we are little time being a child. Well the idea is there is a notion that adulthood must come at the cost of childhood and that simply is not so. Now when you are speaking physically perhaps that is the appearance. But when you are speaking psychically, spiritually, mentally if you will. That child lives on within you. That child represents the freshness, the fascination, the willingness to approach situations as if anew. Simply that child is now embodied within attitudes and willingness to be open and not so much discreetly in what you would call identification with a body type. So therefore never do you in that sense achieve adulthood at the cost of the child energy. You in that sense express adulthood as an enhancement of the child energy. This is how we function. This is how you will begin to function as you cease to invalidate that there is anything less about the childhood. It also is an equal exploration. The advantages of which carry through throughout your life. Much as many of you have surmised some of the negative ideas do but that is only because you recreate them in the now moment. Nothing in any past moment has any hold on you in the now moment other than to the degree that you created. And since you always recreate yourself in any given moment, it is not a memory haunting you and following you along. It is you recreating it and making it re-relevant to that moment. That is why when we say the present is not a result experientially of the past. We mean it. You can create the past in the present but truly you are only ever in the present. In the end I was thinking almost finished. I was thinking about the way you describe how you live and I part of your lifestyle or approach is more like a child. Well in very many senses this is what I am saying. I do not again be an adult at the cost of the childhood. It is an enhanced childhood so to speak. Thank you for the conference. And if we also somehow learn to do that be more like a child. Not be so grown up. It is not a matter of learning. It is a matter of being willing to express what you already are. You contain this. You contain it all. Thank you. Oh thank you. Are babies creating from the moment they are born? For instance with all the abuse and everything that is coming to the surface now of parents, adults to children are they creating it from when they are really little and how do they do that? I think they are but the idea is again as we remind you that your creations are either of the conscious variety or unconscious due to the fact that you create these separations and live within them. So those will be in general results of unconscious creatorhood very often connected with what you call karma which is not a law but completely self-imposed though when you impose it it seems like a law. Because I had thought that maybe with just my own childhood as an example that I had perhaps decided before I even came here to work on a certain problem as did my father and that we were working it out together from the very beginning the plan was made before we were even here. Well in one sense yes in the way that it actually winds up playing out there is more free will of the physical self but again in the childhood you would see less of an transparency of this and be more again perhaps yes functioning more automatically according to the agreement. You don't have to feel guilty about attracting all these atrocities to yourself and really always an option but those feelings of guilt and judgement again separate your ability to transform them and then use them in a positive way. Ultimately how one can make use of these ideas is what then makes you or allows you to express that much more of a complete version of yourself which can then be of that much more service to others. And with the polarity of right and wrong what is your opinion of Dr. Koworki in helping people to end their lives. Again it is not right or wrong it is positive or negative. It would in that sense be completely from my perspective up to the individual case. Therefore this is a general question that I will not give a general answer to. Thank you. Oh thank you. Thank you. No. Thank you. I forget you. I was simply the timing. Thank you. I understand. Have you been paying attention? Yes. Of all. Another part of the question that I was going to ask was I meditated a few nights ago about the and it was a financial question when I was meditating because of a circumstance that just happened or may happen which is kind of unfortunate. And when I was meditating about this I heard a telephone ring and when I picked it up to answer it it was my father. And he told me he had some money for me and that I should call my mother. My father passed away I don't know maybe seven, ten years ago now. And I did talk to my mother today and I told her some of the details and some things that are happening to me and my concern that maybe I wouldn't have a place to live again and that would make me unhappy. And I left it that way. And I also told her that I've done healing work for years. I thought she could hear, they were both things revealing things to my mother who I generally don't really reveal very much of myself. Well back then now you do. Yeah okay. And I'm wondering I would like, yes it's confirmation. I did hear that message from my father and I dialogue with him the next night just to kind of check it and he told me to definitely call my mother. When I said these things to her there was no response. And so I'm wondering did I do the right thing or should I just said something directly or let this rest or. Well again you have done what you felt it was apparent to do but again there is timing from her end involved in this as well. So perhaps you can understand that you have plan to defeat. All right I understand that. A few nights ago I also got a name that I would like to check with you. It was Shota and we would spell it X O T A. Does that name mean anything to you? Well yes but the idea is what does it mean to you. Road, collective psychic road. All right. I would be remiss to say anything else. All right. Now when you share then I expect. I will I'm going to go back and maybe I'll take that into meditation and see what what response I get. Thank you and then we can in that sense enhance your understanding in a particular way but we cannot enhance something that you have not yet. Thank you very much. And at this time I will take another question. Hey. I came for a chicken in the egg. Ah interesting question. In the way that you mean for the answers with this question the chickens but it came from something else and was what you would locally refer to as a mutation. First must come the being then will come the egg of that being. Of the being get here. Ah we will discuss that another time. Thank you. And to you. At this timing we will not take another question. We will in that sense again express our unconditional love and appreciation to you all for beginning to be willing to own your reality. Since you contain it all you might as well get down to owning it. There is simply nothing outside of yourself. There is no outside. Therefore there is nowhere to put anything. It is all within you and it is not a matter of getting rid of a belief and getting a new one. There is nowhere to put the old one. It is all within you and therefore it is simply a matter of choosing from the totality within you. It is not again getting rid of one thing and then getting another. It is simply shifting your point of view. Taking the relevance that you put on things thereby making certain things irrelevant to who you are but again they still exist within you. Everything is done. So there is nothing to run from. There is nowhere to run to. There is only you as you say. Thank God. I bid you all a most fun and loving life dream and rewind and good evening.
