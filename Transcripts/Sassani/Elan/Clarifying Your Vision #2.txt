 All right, I'll say close your eyes become relaxed in your seat standing if you prefer. Take three deep and loving breaths with me now.aos Feel the ground underneath your feet as you walk. Feel the air bristle by the skin of your face and arm. Feel the cool fresh air as you breathe it in walking down this road. As you do begin to notice that this road exists in a most pleasing place and that to your left and to your right are sights that you find most beautiful. Allow your imagination to furnish these sights and allow your heart to furnish the emotion that corresponds to the beholdings of these wonders as you are walking walking walking along the road to ecstasy. Notice the smells, the sounds, the sights. Notice as you say the wildlife. Feel the glow in your heart and understand that the you that you are now being is the preferred you. Watch how that you walks, watch how that you hold its head and hold your hand that way. Be holding sights of beauty and creating the corresponding emotionality of appreciation. Notice off into the distance a doorway. As you come upon a structure, a building, allow your imagination to furnish the form in which you behold this building. It is still quite often to the distance. Notice and continue to appreciate along this path the sights and sounds that you are beholding. Notice as the structure providing the doorway before you grows in size as you approach it closer and closer larger and larger and understand that the structure is quite large, extends as you say into the sky. As you prior to entering the structure scan upward notice in whatever form that it presents itself at the peak of the structure. Any idea, any form of what you call antenna and notice in that sense its shape and orientation. As you approach the opening the gateway the doorway into the structure you notice that there are several as you say steps down and as you approach the doorway you descend down these steps into what you perceive to be a main room in the center of the structure. Allow yourself to perceive the descending down the stairs into the depth, into the heart, into the very foundation of the building that you have entered. Notice the corridor through which you are walking. Notice the various ornamentations that are in that sense etched upon the walls of the hallway and notice that at the end of the hallway is another door leading into a room slowly, purposefully yet effortlessly allow yourself to continue to descend these steps until you reach that doorway. As you enter the room once again centrally located within the structure you will notice that there is a chair. Before that chair there is what you call a table upon that table is what you colloquially refer to as a television set. That television set simply has a wire that would in that sense ascend upward and you understand that that wire connects to the antenna that you have created atop the structure. Allow yourself to approach the chair, sit within it. Notice the features of the room around you. Notice the walls feel the floor beneath your feet. Notice the ceiling above you. Notice its shape, its size. Notice as you say the scent or the smell of the room. Breathe deeply as you sit in this chair and relax. Once again with me now and yet for the first time take three more deep breaths followed by yet another three. Breathing in love and light, breathing out old ideas which no longer apply to who you are. Breathing in knowingness, breathing in self validation and excitement, breathing out self judgment. Notice the sense of relaxation that your body has now assumed. Feel the deeply all pervading relaxation that you have not often felt before. Feel the sense of complete comfort. Simply being where you are, having no ambitions to be anywhere else and having no inclination toward reflecting back on any quote unquote past moment. Drink in where you are, simply being consciously who you are sitting in that chair in front of that television set. Now understand you are within the depths of your own being nest, extending into the heavens yet firmly grounded in your reality as symbolized by the descending steps into this chamber. Allow yourself to understand that you are now connected to what you call your spiritual nature directly yet grounding that spiritual nature into physical world that you are creating. Feel this connection as a bum so as below. Feel the complete knowingness that you are the reality. Understand that what will be broadcast upon that television set is your life is who you are. Literally this device as you have created it is a discernment instrument which takes for granted that there are many overlapping frequencies occurring at the same time, but gives you the ability to finally and distinctly tune into a particular frequency, clarify that frequency, focus that frequency and bring it through seemingly as the only frequency. This is literally what your machine does do. This is literally how it will function within the scenario that you are co-creating with me now. You will understand that as you look down into one of your hands, you will find what you call a right remote control, but you will understand that what this set is tuned to is your excitement, is your vision, is your intention. Understanding this, each and every one of you in whatever way you choose to create it, turn on that set and allow yourself to see your vision. Understand you have the option to as you say lift the channels and thereby check in with the various frequencies, but pay particular attention to what presents itself upon that screen. Again, particularly that which you least expect, which is what shall occur. And as you are flipping through the channels as you say, notice the tone of what you call the programming. Notice the overall emphasis of whatever scenario or quote unquote show happens to come up. Take some time, create some time and as you say, flip through the channel. Understand that what you are seeing upon the screen is you performing actions within scenarios, corresponding and creating events and allow yourself in observing yourself doing so to feel which events attract you more than other events. Remember that as you are again flipping your channels, no one is judging you, therefore grant yourself that same respect. Any show that happens to present itself upon your screen is all right in that sense to watch. Also understand that anything that you are performing within that scenario shows you by virtue of the fact that you are seeing yourself performing it, that it is something completely within your capability. Also, as you see yourself doing that thing, also remind yourself of the fact that you obviously are displaying that you can handle all the power and responsibility that comes along with the playing out with the expression of this idea that so excites you. So feel this and allow yourself to once again focus in on perhaps now beginning to narrow down your channels to but two or three events or two or three overall ideas that you find most exciting. If no one particular program stands out as being any more exciting than any other, then continue to fluctuate and continue to in that sense watch each of the programs. But many or most of you will find that one particular scenario stands out as being that much more exciting than anything else. When that is the case for you, allow yourself to see yourself on the set on the television screen performing the most exciting thing that you can right now picture you will ever do. As many of you will sometimes do, allow yourself to as you sometimes say live vicariously through the image you are seeing upon your television set, absorb yourself in the show still for now maintaining the separation, but emotionally feeling the joy that you feel when you watch a particularly pleasing program. As you sit once again perched in front of your television set. Begin to notice that seemingly the entire instrument is moving toward you growing larger and larger as it approaches you. Understand that perhaps it was much farther away than you had at first imagined and is far larger than you first imagined. And as it approaches you, you begin to understand that you are not watching something occurring behind a screen, but you are watching a scenario through a window or a port hole that now is approaching you and coming into your physical proximity. Allow it to continue to approach you understanding that you will not bump into it. Notice as it approaches that it begins to wrap around you no longer simply maintaining the image of being in front of you, but now surrounding you on both sides. And stand up in your imagination from that chair. Picture if you will the screen now wrapping around you coming to a complete circle in back of you. So now you are surrounded 360 degrees on all sides by the image and are literally now within the image no longer separate from the image. Feel yourself in the scenario doing the most exciting thing as you are doing it feel the joy and what you refer to as satisfaction that comes along with that idea. Feel it, do not analyze, feel it. Notice any unexpected happenings within the scenario. Pay particular attention to things which are occurring that you did not expect rather than the ones that you did. And continue to feel the joy of the identification of being the you you say you prefer to be. When you have fully allowed yourself to feel how it is to be the you you prefer to be. Allow your surroundings to once again become misty and fog like until you are standing in the blackness as you say. As this blackness of time notice that you are once again within your seat within your room upon your planet this evening of your time. And allow yourself at whatever pace is most pleasing to breathe deeply and once again open your eyes bringing back with you this experience. Now understand though particular symbols familiar symbols were used the choice of each symbol is precise the choice of each symbol is purposeful. You have preconceived ideas of many of these symbols and therefore we merely played with you utilizing the symbols already prevalent in your society but this is far more than simply an exercise. It is literally a form of alignment I simply suggest to you that this is only the beginning in that sense of clarifying your vision allowing yourself in a spontaneous fashion to tune into what excites you the most. However again many things that occurred within your vision may have again been unexpected so pay particular attention not to what came up that was most obvious although you can note that as well but pay particular attention to anything within that scenario that came up that was not expected. Continue to focus on the joy that those unexpected ideas brought you the enhancement that those unexpected ideas brought along with them to the scenario and understand that this is how your reality falls into place. As you clarify your vision as a clear intention round and about you does the reality begin to conform round and about you does the reality begin to fall into place to allow you to experience that vision but it will often do so in the most unexpected of ways and that surprise that unexpected direction is just as much a part of your creatorhood for it is literally one of the reasons that you have created yourself as a physical being one of the reasons that you choose to forget your totality and focus on what ultimately would seem like a minute portion of yourself. And this is again not only for the experience itself but the joy of discovery within the playing out of that experience. Very often many of you will lament that things are unknown and this is a complete this acknowledgement of your purposeful application of what you will choose to know and not know. I remind you when you know it all you cannot learn you cannot experience anything seemingly for the first time and you cannot be surprised. Surprise in and of itself is one of the primary reasons for choosing to create a physical reality. Therefore from your higher self perspective is a source of great joy your willingness to flow with the appreciation will allow your reality to deliver things to you by surprise in seemingly the most unexpected way. The ecstatic explosion of coincidence again things will still come from time to time along the most expected path but perhaps more often than not you will find that your willingness to lighten up your grip and insistence that it must come in a particular way will allow it to come far faster through coincidence through surprise through the joy of discovery of who you are. We thank you for your willingness to participate in this exercise with us this evening. Before we continue with what you call the interaction the exchange again I remind you we too are continually discovering this covering uncovering uncovering who we are as well and the process of utilizing your communication as a reflection enhances us in ways that are not immediately available upon merely the experience of our planet itself. So I remind you of this to thank you for your willingness to share with us which brings us more growth than many of you will assume. We are all equal in the eyes of all that is we are all equal in our own eyes. The differences are as fascinating to us as the similarity. We thank you for your willingness to co-create with us in this way and once again resume with shutting. Thank you for your time. What did you receive from yourself within that meditation? The image that came immediately before you proceed also tell me what you perceive that you expected and tell me what you perceive that you did not expect. I've known that for some time for a few years that my intent or my joy would be in doing the tours to the sacred site and the image that came to me immediately was very very happy. I was standing on the steps of a pure head and I was with a group and we all had our arms wide open to the sun. That was nice. Part that I didn't expect when I was first turning the television I saw parts of several lifetimes. One of them was as a queen. I saw myself from the front. I've seen myself previously only from the back and it was Dutch and it had to do with the exploration. I think it had to do with Bonair or one of the destinations that I have right now. I guess that was a surprise since I was just flipping through some of those channels. We have also suggested to you that you are the teacher as well and will now call upon perhaps as well some unconventional sources of your own novelogen experience. Like that you mean? More. I wouldn't think of something like that. Well the point is to keep your eyes out for what you would not normally think of. That has as much significance as the obvious. And what you have shared with me will take on new significance now that you have been willing to open that door. We will discuss that another time. I've been curious about that. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I'm held at my relate. This person incidentally, this queen, you know, at the time when everything was very stiff and had a huge skirt but a very tight waist and kind of a ruffle at the waist. Yeah. Well obviously you were getting good reception. I guess so. Oh. We thank you. Sure. Hi. At least one individual is back from the... Well, you will find in many ways this effect will win and it will also seem to come up in what you call your nighttime sleep in green. This is only the beginning of clarifying your vision. Once you are willing to take the responsibility within your hands to define and lay down your vision, your entire reality conforms to it and delivers whatever feedback would be necessary to quote unquote get your bearings so that you can quote unquote set your course. New protein. Well I found it very easy to get myself into this visual creation. It's like I've always been there. Well, that is one of the reasons we use the popular symbol. The TV. Yeah. One example. I was saying just even to walk down the path to find that structure and your whole symbol. That was great. But yeah, I found myself sitting in front of the television and actually editing, you know, and doing the work because that's what it invites me. Oh, so it's before I got into the TV and watching the programs, I was actually doing what excites me watching it. Oh, do you understand that editing a program is the same as clarifying or focusing it down to its essential components? Yeah. So I didn't, and then after a while I had to really work on seeing myself doing the doing different things in this field. What rose that you did not expect? I saw Roseanne, Michelle. Oh, how can I? It's just dead. I was watching the TV. No, but seriously, I saw... Oh, back to Celia, you saw what? Well... I just saw what I know I want to do. How did it feel to see yourself not hypothetically but doing that? It felt really good. Oh, are you willing to settle for any less than continuing to feel that way? No, I love it. I love the feeling of what I know I want to do. What nuance did you add to your vision through this exercise? What is more obvious about your vision that was not necessarily as apparent prior to the partaking of this interaction? That I can... that there's so many options in this field that I can do. I mean, that's the best I can see it. Well, what else? And as I am discussing with any individual specifics, any of you feel free to plug these ideas into your own mentality and come up with your own set of aspects. Do proceed. I don't know. Well, yes you do. Alright. I just can't see anything more clear than what I know when I went into that chamber. And I went into that room. Oh, there is one thing that you are not bringing out, but I will never force you to have too much time. The idea is that you can replay the scenario. You can enter this chamber anytime. You can tune the dial to whatever you wish, and when you are ready, and that will be the only time you will ever in that sense achieve any effect, you can continue the process. I just want to add that I was seeing my life in a way. Like it was like I was editing these situations and they were basically like my life and just who I am. Well, in a sense what the end can attach into is the simultaneity of your beat, which makes little sense to your physical expression and your physical perception. Thereby the symbol of the television is again the discernment of by allowing you to play it in some linear fashion, which is what then makes sense to your linear perspective. What do I miss? Come on. Now, Telveny, what came up that you did not expect that was a pleasant surprise, which is very simple. There's something I can do to do this later, because I really can't be right now. Well, you will come back and tell me. That is the only way that it can be. So just to re-enact what we just did. If you wish, it will never be a re-enactment, it will be a new creation. Is there anything that can help me to enhance the listening? Simply involve all your senses. Feel, breathe, see, smell, touch, and be in the scenario. That is all. For now, that was a surprise. We thank you. Thank you. Shut it. Hey, thank you. Thank you. During the medication, I went directly to what is my vision and what is my excitement. It was hard for me to be watching it. Because I was in it. I didn't feel like there was any separation. Being in watching it was separation. Do you feel that we were in it living it? Well, that was part of the process of the clarification itself, but I'll write you simply to get the set. Yeah, I felt the presentation that was okay. You may, however, in the future simply enjoy each moment without believing you need to jump to the next. I practiced with this visualizing system. And where I was, I was on my phone. Which is by the water. And there were a lot of animals there. And I was with my teacher husband. Which was with that my face. And my children. And there was a building there for children to come where I was a teacher. And come work with the children also. Oh, this is all quite, again, expected what was unexpected. The unexpected was also north of giraffe. And it's chimpanzee. Oh, that was very good. And that was very unexpected because I've always expected this to be in North America in the United States. Well, you have also expected that it would only be one location. So also, there was an obstinics giraffe and chimpanzee jumped up on me in her playful spirit. Mm. Monkey in the wrong. No? No? How did that allow you to feel? And what do you now feel within yourself that will enable you to be that you, or there is no separation between that you and the you you define yourself to be, other than what you assign? What did that allow me to be? I mean, the unexpected symbols? What? The unexpected symbols seems to be the cue to that it can be broader than I thought it could be. And that is the point. You speak about clarifying your vision. And very often this will be along with the connotation that you must be completely precise about every detail. And what we many times also discussed is that being precise about the overall intention can be quite pointed. Being willing to allow the details to be more broad allows the timing in that sense to be less. And more specific you insist it must be in this exact particular way in your example perhaps. The husband must be six foot tall with black hair. That is something you can create, but it may take a few years longer. If you are simply willing to trust that you will attract the one no matter how he looks, and again this is simply an example. It will allow less necessity for the creation of time to fill every particular nuance and insistence shall I say expectation. So clarifying is the overall feeling about the overall event, but need not mean rigidizing. And shall I say creating a complete insistence that it must be very precisely played out? Your willingness to focus on the intention, the overall vision, and not need to have the specific details allows the details to play out in the shortest time frame. When you concentrate on the details, you generally do so at the cost of the overall intention and create more details. Hence thereby necessity for more time to experience the many more separations and details. So paradoxically clarifying your vision still maintains a type of looseness as to exactly how it will play out and an openness that this or something better. This or something that I will appreciate even more than I can now imagine is an overall open attitude still a focus perspective. Is that a decision? Yes, it is. I have given it quite a bit of detail only because I tried to ground myself in it so that it was real. I mean the details to work with the land of life and that's as I have sort of generalize location. But what we are suggesting is that once you do that, that you concentrate on how it feels rather than fixating on how it must play out in those specific details. You can create details to conjure up the feeling, the emotion, but the point will be that if the reality has me feeling this way, I don't really care that each specific detail is in place. The point is that this is how it feels. Do you understand the distinction? Oh, thank you. Will that be fine? May I? Back to you. Yes, you're fine. I pictured the obvious. I went down a hallway and I came to a stage. There were seats around in order to get down to the stage. You had to go down the stairs. On the stage was the chair and the table and it couldn't picture the TV. But when I looked up, there were all lights like it was a stage for a play. Oh, simply you've brought in your definition? Yes. The feeling that I had was that this was a spaceship that I was in. Oh. The unexpected was that there were aliens. This ship actually had blue lights, bright, small blue lights around the center of it. I did see an alien in this ship. It was almost like a black box in a box to open up and there was this small beam. The feeling I got from that was of awe. You were also feeling the feeling of all directed towards you, Silent Amy. Yes, he was surprised. He was. Yes, he did. The rest of it, the more feelings I got were that the spaceship is near here. It seems like it was pulling me towards the ocean. I pulled my vision to look towards the ocean. And what did you see? That's where the water is, where the spaceship is coming. Now, is this the only channel that you watched? No. Oh, what else did you see? I saw many faces in front of me. I saw a fire, I saw a black face, a black man, a woman. It appeared to me those were all my previous lives. That is quite common in this exercise. And many of you will understand that some of the scenarios that again you did behold will correspond to various, again, frequency presentations or experiences or lives that you have led. Though in general there will be some grounding commonality to this life. There is a specific reason you are seeing any particular scenario. Now, what did you find in the clarification of your own vision to be your most exciting thing? Um. Now, no. Do not make this any more difficult in that sense than it needs. It is quite simple. Are you attracted to the idea of sharing with individuals? Yes. Are you attracted to the idea of teaching in that way? Yes. Can your definition of healing be broader than merely physical hands-on healing? Have you not therefore expanded and clarified your vision in many ways? Oh, what will you now do? Um. It seems like I was setting up to do this for a long time. Well, in a sense you have been yes. But in a sense now is the only moment. So what will you do now? There will be seminars, there will be lectures. And we will do. I will be coaching others to assist people in healing. Excellent. When? I absolutely would. When? When do you believe that it is most likely that you can begin to do so? I will say in a amount of time, say yes or no, immediately with no phone. All right. All right. Okay. One year. No. Oh. Ten years. No. No. You bypassed too. Perhaps you are not understanding what I am saying. I will say a time. And you tell me that within that time if you feel you will be doing these things. Well, you will be doing them within ten years. Yes. Within five. Yes. Within two. Yes. Within one. No. Oh. Therefore right now your threshold of believability is between one and two years. Now understand, the only reason you have such a threshold are the definitions and the least. You may now look at what definitions you hold that dictate to you that it would take that long and you can when redefining these definitions then go through this test again. And you will generally find when you look at simply by being aware of and looking at the definitions that when you run yourself through the threshold of believability meter again, you will find that the time will decrease. It can occur literally as soon as three of your months. But that is up to you. When I say that, if you have as you say a gut reaction that says no way, look at what definitions you must hold to have such a gut reaction and we can shorten this process. But do you understand the overall idea? Now that you are aware of what you believe to be most likely, you get to choose whether you wish to wait that long and if not get to dive into the definitions that you act as though you have that create the necessity for that much time. Again, it can be as soon as three months. All right. Yes. Is there something else? Yes. I felt that I didn't know enough to do that. Well, allow me to say from my perspective that you do. However, it may be that you are not comfortable with the form you have organized what you already know. So you may wish to whatever degree it excites you and in whatever form it excites you to begin to organize your information in what you call any form of an outline. It is simply you already contain the information, but simply laying down what you wish to present and then going through a methodology of presenting it will align and attune your thinking and also move up your threshold of the time, the believability of the time that it would take to do such a thing. Does that give you some homework? Yes, you can. Well, thank you. See you there. I'm judging my vision. Oh. Now, that will keep you in many senses separated from your vision. Why do you assume that it need be any clearer than what you are getting at? What are you getting? Well, I like to say it seems trite, but here's what happened. I first of all saw when I looked at the television said all I saw was a flower and I was planting today. Oh, that's all. To us that is quite a bit. Okay, well, I... There are literally universes within every cellular structure of that flower. Do proceeds, however, it is simply your symbol of your blossoming and unfolding. Okay. Well, that's different. Oh, not so trivial now. But understand that it is up to you to look at it that way as well. But it was a miracle. It wasn't even a rose. Anybody? No, no. Now, now, now. All creations are equal. You are in that sense within the garden and simply you are attracting different senses as well. One flower has no more quality than another. Mary Gold is as rich a flower. So I saw the flower and then I said, okay, well, this is not a real vision of what I can be, so let's change the channel and what I... Well, unless you are interested in gardens. Oh, I like it, but anyway, I guess I... So I changed the channel and what I saw was... I was coming... Well, I saw a lot of my son and his father and it was kind of interfering with everything. Well, no, no. You had to judge that it was, but it was part of your process as well. Okay. Also, I didn't... I tried to distract myself from that because it seemed to be too interfering and stressful. And I didn't understand the purpose in seeing that, so I went to... Well, this is why we gave you a remote control. So I went to a stage performance and because I knew that I liked dancing, I mean, before I did this. And I saw it like a set and we were preparing to do some kind of dancing. And then, like this girl over here who said she got impatient with... Well, it just felt like I was watching it and I wanted to be doing it. So I looked away from the set and there I was in this huge room and the whole rest of the visualization was me dancing to a wall. And I was totally walking for the entire time. And so the judgment I came out with was on the one hand, isn't that beautiful that I could be dancing and not wanting to stop? And the other was, what the heck... Well, everyone knows that's no way to make a living. Right. This is what I mean by the judge. Now, there will always be individuals who say that is nothing for a person to be doing and there will also be individuals who say that is a wonderful thing to do. So the question then becomes why do you agree with the individuals who have the less preferred point of view? And the answer is, all right, you did that, you no longer have to. Do you choose to buy into the invalidations of others? No. You have some say in the matter. Well, I guess when you were talking about that we don't really have to know how we're going to get there. I guess that's what stops me when I think about how I could possibly get there. Do you believe it is within your current set of abilities? Ability? Do it? Yes. Oh, then what is there to stop? Other than doing it or not doing it. And then my next obvious question would be, when will you do something about it? Or that will set into motion a new set of parameters, a new set of settings in your life, which will directly affect what is available in each now moment and allow your reality to fall into line with that vision? Well, I am doing it for fun now and I guess I'm impatient with the impracticality of the fun. Well, all I'm patience is is not allowing each moment to be complete. And in that moment, assuming that there is somewhere else better to be, so when you feel that, simply remind yourself that all moments are complete. Every now moment is complete. Reground yourself to what is there and do not allow yourself to allow it to pass you by. There is complete joy in every moment. And when you exhibit impatience or frustration, you are stating in that moment, I would prefer to be in another moment, which is again a paradox. So when it is available, act due. When you find an opportunity that comes along that has not come along before, jump on it. That will open up completely new door. But etching it as the clear intention sets it up. Foundationally, it will depend upon your willingness, however, to validate that that is as worthy or as quality a thing to do as anything else. And it will continue to be up to you to decide that it is or it is not. That's part of it. Oh, is there something else? No. Oh, thank you. I have shared more with you than you are allowing yourself to now see. It will think in. But again, I also remind you as you are evaluating to also remind yourself what came up that you did not expect as well. And also that anything that came up was absolutely perfect. So something that you are trying to distract yourself from was part of the process, not an interruption in it. Therefore accepting what is already existing in your reality as again part of and not an interruption is also a key area to focus your attention upon. All right. Thank you. Oh, wait, thank you. Shut it. Hey. My. Greetings. And to you. I turned 35 two days ago and I feel like I'm making progress in my life. And I want to thank you for your help and helping me achieve that. Well, all right, I have done nothing. But I thank you for sharing your growth with me and sharing the joy that it brings you as well. That is something that I can learn and grow from as well. I really have been having a lot more joy in my life and I say that because when I talk at these interactions, I know I always talk about the things that I don't prefer, which I'm about to spend a few minutes on. Well, we hear multiple stories. But do you listen? When you started the whole thing out in the first part, you had that very brief visualization for a minute or something. I quickly got the vision that I've seen for myself for a long time in a powerful way. And it was for me just based on love, feeling a lot of love coming through me, first towards myself, then towards humanity through my career and then towards the family. It felt really beautiful and that is what I want and what I wanted for a while. And when we did the second exercise, the longer one, I looked for that and could kind of see it, but it was a little disheartened that I couldn't feel it as fully as I did the first time. Well, the idea is that your attention was then being placed upon what would allow you, the exciting thing that would allow you upon doing to perhaps realize that vision, but the vision in and of itself was not something that you will do as something that you will experience upon doing the exciting thing. So what came up? Okay, not that the unexpected. Well, the unexpected thing that I didn't expect was working with Joseph. Well, but there were also, I mean, the thing that I wanted. Now, by the way, did you see any giraffes and monsters happening? I know, I was wondering if I should bring that up. Obviously, I think. So, I was being honest, but the way I could do what? Very interesting. Do person? Okay. The thing that the question that I have for you is, the way that I want to be is to kind of let myself, first of all, feel that love that I felt for myself so that I can freely do the things that I wanted in my life in terms of interacting with other people in a loving way, unconditionally I see loving others, other people that I see, and somehow imagining and then creating a loving long-term relationship. How did it feel to feel that way within your vision? That felt great. Do understand. You completely created that feeling. And the point that I am making is you always do anyway. So, therefore, as simple as it was, merely turning within briefly to conjure the talk is how simple it always is in any given moment. Okay. Well, the thing that I frequently have that is unpreferable is self-doubt and fear that the things aren't right or something is wrong about me. And I think in part. When you feel that way, can you find it within yourself to dialogue with yourself? Apparently you create the transparency of portions speaking to one another. To simply include within those portions the simple again saying, so what? So what? Big deal. No big deal. You mean big deal to the part that I have? To the judgment. So I judge myself. So what? Who cares? Am I going to allow that to remove myself love? My deserved ability? My preference? No way. You have that choice. Do not assume anything overcomes you. It is expressed from you, but always due to the underlying belief. One of the underlying belief systems that you have no control over, and we have demonstrated in this exercise. That you absolutely do. No voice within you, so to speak, has final say till you agree with it. Therefore, you can look at the option of simply deciding I am tired of agreeing with that voice. Dialogue with it. They are not part of you playing tug of war with you. They are choices within you, and you get to choose from the man. I have in the past done that in chosen love and gotten out of the self-delling space, but more... But what? That is the point. If you have ever done it, you can always do it. And that is all there is to it. More recently, it seems harder. For example, over the past year, whenever I started to get a cold, I figured out how it served me. It went away in less than a day when they were staying for weeks, the same thing staying for weeks for other people. But more recently, I kind of had one for like five days, and I was putting myself down for not being able to... Well, you need not put yourself down simply again if you say, what does the symbol mean to me? Something comes up and the symbol still seems to hang around. Don't fix it on the thing that came up. That was obviously not the only point. Continue to explore. But what is the point of judging yourself for having quote unquote, failed in your intention? All it does is continue the paralysis. Continue through the self-evaluation, seemingly not being able to do what you want. You always have the choice in the midst of that judgment to say, so what? No big deal. I will simply continue with my clear intention to glean from the symbol. Period. There is always a resolve and an agreement on your part when you ultimately match that invalidation. So it is always your choice. Again, it may sound too simple to be true, but simply not to do it. And that has been demonstrated recently by you, draw upon that and continue to do that. But again, not denying what you are feeling. Feeling it, allowing yourself to feel it, then dialogue it. Not dialogueing to talk yourself out of continuing to feel it. Okay. I had an experience this week that I think illuminated for me in part where the frequent self-help comes from. Oh. And that was the... By the way, it comes from you, and you are continuing to recreate. It has no effect on you. It is not separate from you. And even though you say, here comes that judgment again, it is completely new judgment. Dressed in old clothing. Okay. Well, what happened was that my mother called me on my birthday and was criticizing me for something, once again, for something that happened last summer that most other people think what I did was totally reasonable. And the way she's always done. But how exciting an opportunity for you to validate her point of view and in no way take on the burden of matching. Well, that was an opportunity. Well, at the beginning of the conversation, there was like a little boy in me that really wanted her love. And then as things went on, I kind of felt when she was putting me down smaller and smaller. And I realized here I am doing the same thing over again. The question I have is, how do I let go of this desire? I mean, how can I be happier love myself when I'm imagining that she's being critical of me, or that she doesn't approve of me in some way? Very simple. Do not condone her actions by a, judging her in return, or b, matching her judgment of yourself. Period. That is the answer. And your willingness to choose who you are because you know who you are, despite what anyone says, and lovingly reflect that back to her will from her perspective be a different response from you. And therefore, omit a different resulting response in return from her. But where it seems to be a repetitive cycle is where you continue from your end to provide the same feedback to her criticisms, which is in a sense again matching and agreeing with her on some level, and then producing the emotionality of guilt and regret for having done so. But your maintenance of who you are in love, in life, because you love her. And reflecting that complete, unconditionality to her is a far greater surface than you are now imagining to her. And will, in effect, change her response as well. It cannot help but do so. It is again as though you are both playing ping pong. In order for her to continue to play, you must hit back the ball. The moment you simply say, I will not play this game, there is no game. And never can you, all right, to complete the analogy, spike the ball past her. No, she will always hit it. Only can you affect the game from your end. Okay. And perhaps leave her jaw hanging in distance. By having an un-conditionally loving response. And not condoning what she is saying by creating your own version of that judgement towards yourself. I refuse to play this game with her. I do not agree with her judgement. I validate her right to make them, but it has no effect on me because it is not who I am. I do not agree. Therefore, when she is through unloading, so to speak, I will continue to lovingly speak to her. I do that consciously. Well, not patronizingly. But, sincere, if you match and believe what she says and create that effect, you are being completed. If you maintain your resolve and lovingly reflect back that resolve, there is a subtle difference. And you are getting this. See, what I was wondering is, it seems that as I am living my normal life, when I want to come to you. By the way, is that opposed to your abnormal? Well, you know, I'm not going to my mother. That's my normal life. That part of your life. That is part of your natural life. Well, it seems that there are unconscious beliefs that I find myself undoubting. It's like an unconscious belief. What is doubt to you? Is it a lack of trust? No, it's trusting in something I don't prefer. Well, remind yourself of that at the time. But I feel like at the time, did it sneeze up on me? There's the unconscious childhood belief that, you know, I'm no good. And it seems like that sneaks in a lot more. There is not an unconscious childhood belief that you are no good. It is obviously within the choices within you quite conscious. But only do you get the effect when you agree with it. And this is what I am emphasizing. So when you feel it, it is not that old thing affecting you. It is you agreeing to recreate it. I point this out and I emphasize it because your power lies in that moment for you. You can decide not to match it, not to create, allow it to pass you by as simply another option that is not your choice. It's just things that pass weaker too that it's been really, there's been a lot of more than normal self doubt or something. The idea is that you will present to yourself every remnant within you that you have here to foredenize. So therefore another very positive way to look at this is you are accelerating your willingness to transform what you still express that you do not prefer. And it is very exciting. The fear of the cucumber that I might write like morally hurt myself or something like that. Well the idea is that you do not allow yourself to feel that fear. Feel it and you will find your shall I say suppositions to the most foundational. It is when you say here comes that fear, better stray my attention and think about something else that it seems to take on more weight. But when you say all right, I am willing to allow this fear to permeate me and if I explode, so be it. That attitude of diving into it. Then allows you to experience the fear and understand that you always live through it. It cannot overcome you and feeling it is paradoxically the answer to your question. Then dialoguing about what you must have believed which will become most obvious. Allow yourself to feel the fear. Allow yourself to remind yourself it will not destroy you. That would be pointless and there are no pointless creatures. What do you mean feeling fear? How do you feel? Sit in the chair, lie down and when you are feeling what you call fear or anxiety, say all right, I will feel this. If it seems to be coming up on its own, I will do the best that I can to really feel it. And therefore then think whatever it is you wish to think to create that fear. First case scenarios or whatever. Allow your mind to imbue the fear to a degree you have not allowed yourself to. You will live through it and when you do you will understand nothing can overcome you without your permission. Okay. Oh. Yes. For now, that will be. Thank you. One more chance. I just wanted to share with you my about my meditation. I had a few things I saw that I most of the studying one was I was in the theater at the stadium stage with this beautiful blue sequin gown and it was a big crowd. And there was healing going on, not with touching but somehow through work that I had done. Now are you not finding it fascinating at how many of you have watched a similar show? Do you feel seen? Yeah, I did know I was looking at it. I guess for a minute I was judging the thing. Shouldn't I be singing or dancing or something like that but that wasn't the story. It was different. Yeah. That was sort of like I had either written a play or it was a variety show or a six-day show. Or something like that. There was definitely humor involved in it and it was a little less though masterpiece theater but do proceed. And it was very healing to the audience. And what came up that you did not expect. And that particular scenario? Yes. Well maybe just how healing it really can be. Like a sort of healing. Understand the following. What you call laughter is a form of healing. It is a complete centering but centering to what you call the positive. Crying is also a form as you say of centering though generally the perspective around which you are centering is quote unquote the negative. So understand that laughter in and of itself is a healing energy. It is the energy of alignment and identification as an idea. The thing that I was surprised that I didn't see was more of the handicapped kid or the exercise and stuff. Well allow yourself to get in touch with these ideas. Allow yourself to evaluate anything that may seem to have been left out as well and reassess why you were doing that. Was it an expression of your excitement or was it an expression of something else? You get to look at it. Do you understand what I am saying? You talk to me about the fear one. Has that an expression of my excitement or something else? The lack of those particular individuals is what I was referring to. Oh okay. Are those individuals a reflection of what excites you? Are there other reasons that you had heretofore assumed that that was your exciting thing? Do you understand? Yeah. Oh. Is that? Yeah. Then I thank you. At this time allow me to say the following. As we have shared next interaction we will discuss, the deserved ability and definition after that action. All of this falls under the category of conscious creatorhood. Conscious creatorhood is a function of allowing yourself to remember who you are through self-validation. Therefore I find it quite apropos in, in that sense as you say, wrapping up this interaction. To simply wish you all a happy memorial day for you are literally remembering who you are. We thank you for your willingness to create the synchronous of this idea upon your planet at this time. And we will see you in what you call your dream. Good evening.
