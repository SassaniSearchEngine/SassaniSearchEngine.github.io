 All right, I'll say I bid you greetings this evening of your time as you create time to exist. How are you all? Thank you very much. Are you all live? Yes. Thank you very much. We will begin this interaction this evening of your time with a discussion about a common misunderstanding upon your planet. And that may be entitled free will. There is some question in your society about the idea between predestination and free will. If my life is predestined, an individual may ask that how is it that I have free will, for they would seem in that sense to be mutually exclusive. We have shared the following analogy with your civilization and will do so again with the fly expansion. Recognize, although you create yourself at this time, to exist upon what seems to be many levels, differing levels of consciousness. You are in your purest form, so to speak, your higher self, as you call it, a 100% whole being. Living all those realities that you have created simultaneously, it is your higher self, the totality of all the lives you have ever lived, as well as the totality of all the lives you will ever read. The sense it is already complete. Therefore, it is perspective in the way that you create. This reality is a bit more expanded than the perspective that you assume or don when you create yourself into this reality. The parameters of this reality necessitate by definition that you do forget, colloquially much of your totality. That allows you within this exploration to have focus to the being you are, the individual you are now, without all the recognition of all the other individuals you have been. For real life, if you were right now, well of all of them, you would have quite a bit of difficulty in remaining focus as a singular personality. Therefore, by definition, you impose upon yourself, colloquially speaking again a forgetfulness of 99.9%, if not more, of the totality of your being. Now, understand, from the perspective of your higher self, it is all free will. But what may be the free will of your higher self may seem as free destination to your physical life self. Again, because you have cut yourself off from the broad focus of your higher self. And in that sense, it has the whole picture where you create yourself to discover parts of the puzzle, making the picture. So, recognize. Very generalized, in very generalized ways, your higher self's free will express itself as certain individual discoveries. You may again use this following analogy. If your higher self through its free will, determines that you will walk down a particular hall, then walk down that hall, you will. In that sense, you are three-destants who walk down that hall. Now, understand, it is not literally that you will walk down a hall, this is an analogy. Where the free will of your physical life self, however, comes in, is the style in which you walk down that hall. You can walk down that hall in many ways, with many attitudes, with many different perspectives. And that walk down that hall can be very pleasant, or very miserable. For you are perfect creators. And even when you create misery, it is perfect misery. So, do understand again. You can simply walk down that hall. You can skate down the hall. You can skip down the hall. You can run down the hall. You can fill the hall with water and swim down the hall. You can freeze the water and ice-state down the hall. You can allow the water to be snowed upon and ski down the hall. There is no limit in the free will of your physical life self in how you will experience that hall. Now, allow us to expand upon this before we have said this before. The idea of being that the free will of your high self will always be quite general. It is not that it will say you will experience any particular aspect of morality. They are neutral explorations, for instance. It is not that one would incarnate to necessarily have to experience lack of abundance. However, your high self as a general life theme may have that one of the individualized explorations or halls that you will walk down is simply the exploration of abundance. Period. Now, what this means is you can create through your free will negative abundance which you label lack, poverty, which in a sense is a type of abundance or a positive abundance which you label well having these men in that sense. But again, the generalized theme of your high self is just that, very general. And you can always have the choice to experience this in a positive way. Remember, as we have said, all situations are fundamentally neutral, like and have no in editing. If you wish to look at it that way, there are simply props in the play of life you are creating. Therefore, you assign the meaning, the meaning you assign determines the effect you get. So, recognize you are not predestined to suffer. You are not predestined to explore negativity. The choice of polarity will always be part of the free will of your physicalized self. So, the themes of exploration of your high self will always be quite general. Therefore, recognize if you are now creating in your life any negative manifestation, they are simply your willingness to take that neutral prop and label it negative. That means that you will, in a sense, crawl down very miserably, that all. But it is simply your choice in that way of how to experience any of those generalized themes. There is not a positive or negative built into it. So again, you can now begin to realize that you are not predestined for misery. You are not predestined for negativity. You, in fact, are predestined for total neutrality. And in that sense, you will always have the free will to determine how you will experience your reality. You understand that from your physicalized self perspective, this is all the free will you actually need in order to create the life you prefer. So we simply steer your thinking in this direction so you will begin to take back the power in your life. Or you can only change your life if you are willing to own it. If you build in limitations such as I am predestined in that way to experience negativity, it will seem to happen to you. It will seem to overwhelm you, but it is all a definition and in a sense, though possibly subconsciously. Many individuals use the idea of predestination or even negative karma as an excuse to continue to create negative realities. Simply allow me the pleasure and joy to inform you that this is not at all necessary. And it is up to you in how you will experience your reality. Before we begin with the sharing, allow me to also say one of the products of creating time is creating the corresponding processes that take time. When you have a conception, when you have any idea, at the moment you have that idea, you are by definition that idea. Now, the tendency or habitual ritual in your society is to call that simply an idea with no weight that you must then create a process in order to have it manifest. Recognize this is valid, but simply also only ablely. There need not be the process unless you believe the only way you will validate the change is through a process. The moment you have that conception, the moment you feel that you are, that feeling. If you will but continue to now act as though you already are that being, no process is necessary. You are now vibrating as that being and will attract the reality necessary to continue to be that being. So do recognize that it is all within your grasp and it is all your free will, your choice. Therefore, in summarizing the having of the idea is the same as the being of the idea. All you need simply do is act that way. You will immediately be that being. The being that you have chosen to be up till now has been supported by the universe by much the same mechanism. Your assumptions about it. Therefore, the universe will also support you when you will begin to be a true and full expression of that which you have chosen in this life to be. Ponder that for a while and allow me to thank you and express my appreciation for your willingness to co-create among the many levels you have created. To open yourself up to the higher self, not that you have, but that you are and recognize this is the transformation of time upon your plan. The ending of a cycle of 25,000 years, you may label the cycle of limitation. You are entering the cycle of integration. By definition, you would only know, co-weekly speaking, that you are integrating if within that transformational life's value first created the limitation so that you can feel it so that you can experience that limitation and then transform from it. So this is a very special opportunity, mass consciousness speaking, and that the entire planet has chosen to transform individuals even within the 25,000 years cycle of limitations were always able in that sense to take back their power and create their reality consciously. But there was not shall we take such a wide support system. So therefore, because it is now happening on mass, you will now find the ease to attract many other individuals to allow you to continue to be who you are and allow yourself to be of service to them as well as allowing them the gift of being of service to you. And for this again, I thank you and ask you now how may I be of service to you, share it. Ms. Shahar. Hey. I'm trying to take what you just said and put it in the format of my question, which was very interestingly similar. Oh, what? Yes. I was going to ask you what psychological and spiritual issues I needed to complete to feel myself out to be to attract my name to. Oh, have you heard us speak before? Yes. Have you heard us speak about the idea of the primary relationship being that with your own self? Yes. Do you understand that again by feeling you need someone to complete you, you can only attract a reflection of your feelings of incompleteness? I'm not sure how much I feel I needed and how much I feel it would be a joy to share these. Did we recognize them? The answer to your question would simply be to examine your relationship with yourself. We recognize when we talk about loving yourself, we talk about loving yourself unconditionally. In your vernacular, this means even colloquially speaking if you screw up. So you may now understand and catch yourself when you are going into self-judgment for that its separation. That is not integrating your personality. So therefore allow yourself to catch yourself in judgment of yourself and realize this is the remaining vestigence of integrating your primary relationship. When again you feel complete as you are already, then you will only draw a reflection to yourself of that reality. Another individual who feels complete who will also reflect back to you your completeness. And rather than having, as you say in your society, a 50-50 relationship, you will have a 100% relationship. This is co-creation. This is ecstasy. This is joy in interacting. Does that help? Yes, up to a point because I'm not fully aware of where I don't feel. Right now I feel the best that I've ever felt about myself. The judgments and the harshness are definitely deciding. Oh, right. So I'm trying to find that this is still a little bit but gone. Yeah, but it doesn't happen to be perfect. I mean... Well, you already are from perspective. Always perfect. A perfect reflection of wherever it is you are exploring at that given moment. There is no perfection in that sense to strive for. You already are a perfect reflection. But the idea is, are you waiting around for this thing? Not mostly. So sometimes in that sense you are waiting around for somebody to come in which you would feel more complete. Simply look at that and understand you do not need anything, anybody. You have what you need. When you can emotionally express that, everything else will be as you say, I think I'm okay. Thank you. Does that make sense? Yes. Is there still a point at which we have not gotten beyond? It feels like a perfectionist's standard to me as I watch other people in relationships who don't seem to have achieved that level and yet they have attracted somebody. All right. But you understand the spirit of what we are saying. Not looking at others to determine how yoli-a-lish should be. Not judging that they are making it and you are not. That is not feeling complete. It is not that you must be in that sense picture perfect in the way that you mean. But again, you are always a perfect reflection. Simply when you will relax into enjoying your own company in that sense that will be a reflection of feeling complete. And then you will be surprised at how many people knock at your door. It is in a sense already happening. Simply allow yourself to see. I'm getting there. Oh, you are already there. You always were. And you always will be. Wherever you need be at any given moment. So recognize again. You do not have to create a process. Simply your recognition in this given moment that you are complete is enough. Simply again, now move forward. That's act. That's what it is. You will attract that reality by definition. Have we moved to that point? Or do you have another question? I think that's good. Oh, it's something that goes please. Thank you very much. Shady! Good job. Hey, my own. Previously, you discussed the distinction in the maybe-s in the second three and the expectation. Hey. There's a bit of confusion on that on my car. How warm? Very good, you are cold. You are cold. So you have any portions of yourself and give yourself the other. I've always the- I believe, I've been operating under the belief that the more specific I am in- in beneficing itself, and the more specific I am in, in finding what it is that I want to manifest, the more exactly I can bring about that creation and the more focused Focus, I can put on that creation. The more force I can bring to bear in bringing in the past, bringing in the manifestation. Thank you. Okay. So that seems inconsistent with this sense of expected see. We understand. Okay. Allow us to explain. It is not that one need be vain in what they wish. It is simply if you are imposing a timeline, I wish you to come very soon. The more vague that you can be, the more different ways it can manifest. If you are precise, you can, in that sense, still create that thing. Though the more parameters you put in, the more time it may take. So simply when we suggest that to individuals, we are addressing the idea that they wish you to happen very soon. Does that make sense? It does make sense. The more parameters you impose in that sense, the longer it may, not necessarily, but may, take. So if you do wish to speed it along and you will loosen up, you will find it to come more quickly. But it is not that if you are very, very precise, you cannot get that thing. Again, you are adding however steps to the process and are not allowing anything but that to come. And that may be a bit down the line. Also, if you are a bit more vague, generally what does happen is the thing that comes far out, lives your expectations. Over, in that sense, welcome. The thing that comes is beyond the initial expectations. So therefore you allow yourself to have it happen most quickly and with the joyous surprise of the being that much more than you say you desire. When you rigidize it down, you do not, in that sense, allow for more to come. So may I simply make a suggestion. If you wish to be that specific and you are in that sense willing to wait, you may wish to add the phrase this or something better. Alright. That will open it up a bit. Does that answer the question? Yes, and I add another dimension to the question. Oh, great news. When one is insisting on being precise in one's manifestation, is the limiting factor the ability with which one precisely registers their request or the rest of the universe complying to those requests? In the sense again, the more parameters you impose, the more you are saying you will only accept a particular thing and not being open to all the other things which may bring that themselves. Does that answer the question? Yes. Oh, do you have another question? No. We thank you. Sharon. Sure. Hey. An observation on a previous point. I find if I want to feel complete, the affirmation I am complete doesn't seem to help. Alright. If you say so, it carries the suggestion that I am not complete. If you say so, well, okay. These are all beliefs, don't just that, but go on. No, alright. That's right. If I want to get a factory to imagine something that is very complete, such as the old it is. Oh, how creative? Yes. Oh, say I am the old it is. Well, I've got to be offered to be. Please. Alright. I have one line and you can use your imagination in that sense with any information we ever give to, tailor it to you. But simply if an individual would be willing to say, I am complete and then act that way, then they will be in every given moment complete. What you, I assume or say is that you simply say I am complete and then do not act it. So therefore, of course, it would seem a bit hollow. Oh, alright. From being complete also, I like to point out. I recognize again the paradoxes you are always complete anyway. Right. It is simply that you create the distinction that you are not. But again, go on. Being complete for me contains the sex or feelings being incomplete. Oh, alright. So it's interesting. That even, you are exploring that. Okay. One more question. And that is regarding futureing, the process of creating the future. I am beginning to understand the earth, this earth we are suing on as a kind of nurse with other earths. In a sentence study? Yeah. In the deep, in the deep, in the earth, I walk in the earth as an opportunity and a free will. I was a publicist who walked down its hallway in any way that she was. The question I have is how many consensus earths are in the nursery right now? How many are in the making? It's making a bit unsettling, but the best hat I can give is infinite. Wow. I recognize you exist within an infinite universe because you are finite. That is a bit difficult to grasp, but it is infinite. And anything, anything that you can imagine on some level, in some plane, some dimension of existence exists. Okay. What? Oh, okay. I'm beginning to grasp this. Every individual in the potential universe in an actual universe. Okay. And puts a number of individuals together in what grew. Then you have a combined entity, a combined medicine toward the creation of the reality that they anticipated will occur. In a sense, there is a group of people on the planet that is creating perhaps the world into a garden, the garden earth, the garden cloud. There is a modern cloud that is creating an earth that has a genocidal transformation, which is nothing else, whatever. And yet another earth that is creating another cloud, creating the earth, another cloud creating a different reality. This is correct. And if you're interested in your comments. Again, we understand in that sense what you are saying, but simply wish to ask you now, which earth you are on. Well, I hope I do a garden cloud, but I think I do recognize the hope and fly it out. All right. I'll try. I'll work on that. I'll. You may wish to play with it. I do not have to do what? I do not have to reply so much effort. You are on whatever earth that you will proclaim that you are on and then walk in action as though you are on that earth. Okay. If you will, but be the embodiment of a peaceful loving being, your reality will be an earth of peaceful lovingness. Starting with your immediate vicinity and spreading out as a ripple of a stone thrown in upon your entire world. And this happens with each and every individual. For creation is that multi-passed it to allow a place if you will for every knowledge, that's selection. Does that, I think the question is, wow, I can't answer this infinitely. Oh, thank you very much. For sure. Any. My question seemed timely. We talk about the recursive universe and you often refer to the multiverse. And I sure welcome your elaborating that quite a bit. Oh, yes. If we that in your society, there is a notion that your soul and system does in that sense reside within a galaxy and that many galaxies reside in one single universe. All right, that is one perspective. It is not an attempt incorrect from the standpoint through which it is created. However, from a more multi-passed standpoint, understand that there are many universes, many dimensions of experience. Therefore, we have relabeled the universe, if you will, to be the multiverse, for we feel that it's a bit more precise. And that is all. Is that a bit more than the specific answer you are seeking? I know. I think I sometimes focus on numbers and statistics and all that. But again, on the staff, you are treading on the infinite. If you are going to ask me, are there only 26 dimensions? I will say no. Mathematically speaking, according to one common theory upon your planet, yes. Because, logically speaking, there are infinite universes, infinite dimensions of experience. There is no end in that way to the universe. I was even going to ask the worst question on that. How many billion people exist right now in our universe? Again, understand within your own Milky Way galaxy, there are hundreds of millions of stars. Through which, from our, shall we say, explorations, we have the journal that are approximately 63 million intelligent civilizations. That is in one galaxy alone. If you refer to the association of the world as being roughly 350, 400, whatever civilizations? And only in that sense, am I using representation of the multiverse? Is that association of worlds? Is the scope of that our galaxy only? Shall we say several galaxies in the surrounding areas? Many of which are within your galaxy. And you are saying there are more than one association of worlds. In the way that you mean? Yes. In the one that we speak of, we speak of the same ones. In the one that we in that sense have most relevance to. The one that we in that sense network through. And when our Earth becomes a member of that association of worlds, you keep saying as though it will be the association that the sun belongs to. Is that right? Yes. And many other other civilizations currently visiting your planet after sun, amongst which are the pliades, sea ia civilization, zeta reticulum, arb tollis, and a few of them. Will the human beings transform about the same time as the dolphins in the whales? Shall we say it will happen on a planet that is scared? In the way that they create their consciousness, they are a bit more for density already, but still have roots or tails. Thank you very much. Oh, thank you very much. Sure. Any? My little simpler question. Do you understand, however, there are no worse questions than what they do. Two simple, two propagated, they are all valid and all synchronous degrees attract themselves by no accident due to fatigue. Thank you. I find personally a little confusing, and I find myself confusing, in balancing the eye itself with physical self and the... Oh, my God! I would like sometimes just to work, just for the joy of working, and to work about money, and to work about money, and money sometimes takes away from the place you are working, and in dealing with the daily, earthly, and spiritual blending together creates some kind of confusion within me. Oh, are you aware of our definition of abundance? Mm-hmm. Oh, right, what is it? Everything all the time, all you need, all you want? In a sense, however this is more precise, the ability to do what you need to do, when you need to do it, can you? Now, understand there is no mention of money, and when you fixate on any symbol as the only way, you will allow it to represent your abundance. We suggest this is where you focus your energy. By focusing down and narrowing in on one particular symbol, money, again, you do not allow yourself to be open to all the other possibilities. And as your planet does transform, the idea of abundance will become more multi-caccident. There will be more of an even equal exchange, and that medium of money, although one valid representation of abundance is not the only one. So are you fixating on that? And when you have it, say things are going well, when you don't, say they are not. Is this what is occurring? Oh, then simply, when you do not have it, you may now begin to recognize you are a perfect creator. Therefore, by definition, at that moment, you don't need it. And you can look around and see the many other ways in which you can do those very same things you say can only occur with the money. Then you will open yourself up to all forms of abundance. And by vibrating, as a being willing to accept that abundance, paradoxically very often, get more money. Can you define abundance again? The ability, the ability to do what you need to do when you need to do it. Here we go. Thank you very much for the opportunity to share that. And for giving yourself the opportunity to see where you are in place, a limiting belief in your reality. For your simple willingness to not limit yourself in that way will open it up. And it is that simple. You are perfect creators. If we begin to not look at anything as an interruption in your past, it is part of the past. By your labeling, not having money as an interruption, you act as an interrupted person and then feel the effects of being interrupted. But it is not the other way around. The interruption doesn't come first. So realize there are no interruptions and begin to now look around since it is most obvious what you cannot do in that given moment at the other things that you can. And it is that simple. Are you willing to allow it to be that simple? That will be all right. Thank you very much. Thank you. Share. Yes. Let's go back to the infinite universe idea. Oh, I have never left this but go on. Please be very Mr. Happy, very mad. What more? Be bold. So then they share. It sounds like a very much of the man-made idea of more and more and more and more. Always looking, oh, it's listening for signs of mind, don't swear. What about the notion of feeling the rear you meet? Each you meet and our very, our planet that you meet. We'll do recognize that it is. The many expressions of infinite creation are each unique in our own way. Just as each individual upon your planet is not special but unique. Now, think of the possibility of this unique conception. I think if we felt that way, we would really care for this planet and take care of it. So it's the only universe that is like this and we are the only ones too. We would care for each other and care for our universe and we wouldn't treat it as so we'd suspect. And there are all kinds of more of this more and more and more because we came to it. Appreciate it. Don't you think that's the possibility and might be worth mentioning? I think it's a wonderful idea when will you do it? Right now. Oh, my. Very good. And it is that simple. We recognize that your planet is also a sentient being. Has its own consciousness is quite capable of very much more than you, as shall we say, discovered in your science. It's very much more capable of recuperating from the things that you are doing to it. But it is allowing you as a civilization to find yourself. It unconditionally loves you. We'll not lose that unconditional love, even if you did in a sense, blow it up, which we do not sense will happen. But the idea being that it is participating in the transformation. And in all the more willing one individuals will begin to return that love to accept it. Great. Let's go. Oh, we are all ready there. Thank you very much. Shen. I have a question. Oh, what happened? Yes. Why? Stick up. All right. Why? I understand. Two questions. Why are we here? Do we have tippers and three and the skids? And why is it particularly in essence, and could you give us a little protection or less, if there's a key to us in our presence, or if there's tips on our dog, or something like that? Could we get rid of them without having to kill them or touch them or modify them? Oh, do you understand? Anything in your externalized reality is a reflection of your consciousness. The animals upon your planet are territorial because you are territorial. Upon our planet, we are not, and our animals are not. We shall we say reflections provided by some of your insects can be a bit as you say, testing. And this is because within your consciousness, you do not. You personally, however, contain the idea of being able to be a test to others and allowing others to be a test to you. So simply you can realize again that anything is an externalized symbol. What you will draw from a symbol will vary from individual to individual, so it is not that they are there for one reason. They are there for as many reasons as individuals that will interact with them. However, you can exist harmoniously with nature, and your ideas can simply be chewing it away, catching it in the cup, letting it outside, these types of things. It will always be your choice to kill it or let it live. Is there something more specific you are seeking? Is there any sin in killing it? From our perspective, no. However, it will depend upon your belief system. The ones that are killed in that sense from our perspective have agreed to be killed before we understand the perfection of all reality, and nothing is extraneous. However, in a sense that does not really excuse the perpetrator for your belief systems in general include, thou shalt not kill. So therefore, if that is your underlying belief, you may create the idea that it is a sin, but we refrain from using the terminology sin altogether and simply say a bit separated rather than integrated. Does that make sense? Does that ask the question? Yes, but I will tell you this. I will tell everybody here that they do a good pathway to the system. Oh, I do not invalidate yourself, but I see. You can catch anything, like a spider, a leader, or a hawk. I say you went, well I haven't done any of this before I put it out of the door. You said it was a death, losing doubt. And I saw that from the door. Oh, do you recognize you have brought up another valid point? You can dialogue with nature. It is not, shall we say, the most common procedure on your planet, but they will respond. It is the reflection of your consciousness. If you are willing to approach any aspect of nature as being equal to you and speaking to them as an equal may certain request, they will comply. But generally individuals do not sample that reality. So you now may begin to consciously dialogue with nature. Act in that sense. The mosquitoes do not come unless they want to not bite. We know this sounds strange to the audience, but this is beginning to be in commune with nature. When the concept of being a pest or allowing others to be a pest to you, which incidentally is the true mechanism, you can ever actually be a pest. It is simply that individuals allow themselves to be a pest or then the symbols of that type of interactions with your bugs will subside. Do you follow us? Yes. Thank you very much. Sure. I have questions. All right. Do closely. All right. When humans kill another human, it's considered like awful, okay? But why when an animal kills another animal is considered nature? Oh, thank you very much. The idea of being that your animals do not have the ability to analyze, to think, to self-reflect in quite the way that you do. So therefore your chain of nature in that sense does not have the option of not killing. It comes down to be or be killed in nature. Again, this is a reflection of your consciousness also. But humans have the ability to reflect, to think that something is right or wrong. And when they think that something is wrong and do it anyway, they create a consequence that they then suffer. Does that make sense? Yes. Can I ask one more question? Oh, it will go on. There's no limit. When you say special and then you meet, what's the difference? The idea being that no individual is more special than another, you are all equally special, but that does not mean that you are not unique in that way. A. One moment we are scanning for the language. All right, we understand. The idea being that each individual is just as special as everyone else. No one is more special than anyone else. Unique in that way. Having their own particular qualities that are inherent to that person. Again, that is a bit of a language barrier. But you understand. Thank you very much for sharing. Share it. For sure. Speaking of killing, I'd like to ask you about that. Oh, all right. And one more one, but it's kind of a dead subject to the world. And do you understand from our perspective that death is simply walking through a door and not an ending? My question, I guess, is about the will, I guess. And maybe the will to live and then the death itself. Does death come upon us as a result of the willingness to let go of life? Can they? There are very many different scenarios depending upon the individual discussion. Do you have any specific scenarios? The guy who walks outside a building and gets crushed by a falling piano. In that sense, it is within his timing, within his agreement. But again, not consciously on this level as you create this as a level. The higher self, shall we say, that was the whole? His agreement, his timing. Where is that determined? In a sense, from the higher self and what you might label colloquially between lives, will understand from the perspective of the higher self, there is no time. It is all happening right now. The only time there is, however, one exception in which an individual may, shall we say, bow out before exploring all their agreed upon this company. And that is what you label, physically suicide. However, after doing such an act, individuals will then place themselves back. What's the other thing? When that individual may return, will he return as a child or a child? In general, we'll reincarnate again and then very acceleratingly create the same type of scenarios or that from that similar perspective. In general, yes. In general, are there exceptions? There are always exceptions. Like what? Well, it is quite uncommon and generally not in that sense applicable to the suicide scenario, but what you have labeled for walking scenario, which is very rare. And that an individual makes an agreement with another oversold that he will notice that step out in the middle of a life and allows someone else to step in. In general, when this seems to have happened in your society, however, it is not exactly that, but individuals opening up to more of who they are, which seems like a sole leading person. But both scenarios do exist. Very interesting. Did I ask you the question? One moment. Did I ask you the question? Yes, I think. Oh, again, if you will be willing to act for elaboration, that will give us the allowance to find it. So if something is going to go to see, please step in. You will not be interrupting tonight. Is there suicide in reality, or is that even predetermined between one person? Again, that is the one exception. That is not predetermined. It is the lowest I'll say, I quit. You're not going to play. Is that wrong? It is no wrong. That is simply integrated, separated, positive, which is integrated, negative, which is separated. And a bit separated, I would say, however, there is no cosmic wrong. And again, because the individual will generally place themselves back in the situation, if anything, more of a setback. Thank you. Thank you. Chet. For sure. A scenario, getting back into the mosquitoes. Oh, right. Okay. When one is out in the woods, and woods in full mosquitoes, what can one do to effectively cohabit the space with the mosquitoes without being held to one another? It is very simple. Utilize the symbols of the odd society. For instance. Or. Understand you have created the symbol, and you live in harmonious alignment with them. You are recognizing they are merely extensions of yourself, but that does not make them any less valid. Therefore, you have physicalized yourself, created yourself upon the planet. A veil yourself to the other physicalized things that will allow you in that sense to live, or honestly. May not. No, that's good, but will allow you in harmoniousness. However, do you understand the gist, however? I understand the gist, but it is my scenario is one in which a person finds themselves in the woods. They have not been able to avail themselves of these symbols. A situation exists. They need to interrelate with the nature around you. What are the arbitrage? An individual in general will not, out of the blue, create that scenario. So what becomes hard to comment on a what if scenario? We prefer to comment on a what is scenario. Have you found yourself in those woods? Yes. Oh, yeah. And what did you do? Sometimes I got fit, and sometimes I didn't. And I've not yet made the distinction between what I did in one case and what I did in the other. Oh, very exciting. So you already least in that sense only that you may have some control and you do. Yes. Simply continue to explore that. And when you discover what the distinction is, come back and share. Many others, particularly these individuals will be interested. Thank you. Oh. Sure. Yes. Hi. As we do. Good guys. I have been thinking more and more about the empathic communication. Oh, is it good right now? Are you aware of it? I don't know. You will be. Pressing. Okay. I've been, I tend to talk to people just when I don't have a chance or I don't create a time to call them on the phone or talk to them verbally. And I talk to many people who are far away. And I'm wondering, I guess I'm looking for validation that they hear me or it's effective. Like if I... Have you asked them? No. Oh, that would be our first suggestion. Simply opening up communication. I sent the message. Did you receive it? Okay. Oh, you did not? Next time, listen more careful. Yes. Yes. The willingness, shall we say, of your ability to exercise being what comes to you? The exercise being what common means of communication will aid you in using the less common ones. Again, communication will always take the line in your reality of the weaknesses. Do proceed. And also, I want to know about unseen people like you or other spirit guides or the stars and how they... How to create the most open line to them. Oh, again, as you have said. By opening up a dialogue in your meditative state, utilizing the tool not for fantasy generating elements, the tool of your own imagination. A dialogue is only two ways. Your willingness to communicate, outflow, and then your willingness to receive the reception. So, therefore, by definition, both must be present. Simply carry on the dialogue and leave the space to listen. Even if you symbolically do so with your physical ears, you will get the message. Then and only then, the last step in order to continue the dialogue is to validate what you get. Do not, in that sense, invalidate it. It is that simple. Now, we can add many more complex details, however it is that simple. What is occurring here is a type of hell and fact that communication. The channel for lack of a better turn is being as me, which allows my communication to come through, utilizing his subconscious memory, and therefore what you are getting is a model of my energy through the model of his energy, and in fact, a third entity altogether, the blending, as well as the blending of others in my civilization. And always others in the association of world as they choose to fight him. What the hell? When will you do it? How much time? Sure. Yes. They are back at continuing earlier thought. What is the hypothetically that there are three consensus hurts or many? How do you say they want three consensus hurts? Yes. 84, oh, I can't tell. The, but, but it would be true to say that each of these nations hurts, or just in the formation, have its own set of guiding lights among our extraterrestrial brothers, so that perhaps you are associated with the creation of one Earth. May I ask you a question? Do you imagine that this is not? Yes, I do. Why are you asking me? Do you not trust your imagination? Are you not willing to validate what you are getting is very creative, very exciting to me? I am not invalidating your willingness to interact with you, simply pointing out to you that you already know this. Okay, let me make a statement. All right. What are you doing? Oh, yes, be bold. Thank you very much. That there is a lot of apparent conflict between books, the new ancient materials, and so forth. Having to do with what is going to happen in the future, a variety of different predictions. The conclusion I have come to is that in that there are multiple Earths in the formation. There are multiple steps of predictions, and each set is true. There are all tunes on. Now, do you understand that there is one given. There will be great change. Period. Now, many of the predictions of which you are speaking were made while there was great turmoil upon your planet. Therefore, the interpretation of great change in those eras was one of destruction. In order to build up an interview, you must knock down the old trials by fire. That is why those predictions take that come from our perspective. However, they are simply sensing of the energy of the change with judgments, with interpretations, negative interpretations of how they must go about. But great change, there will be. And, from the perspective of positively oriented beings, they will only experience that change in a positive way. If there are negative aspects upon the particular Earth that you are on, you will not be there. You will, by coincidence, not be there. You will not attract yourself into any of those scenarios. They will seem to happen in that sense around you and not touch you. And this is the way, again, that you will become, as you expand, more aware of the positive, more aware of the negative, but only need experience, the positive. Still, again, maintaining an awareness of the negative, but not experientially. Wow. Thank you. Thank you. My little share, it's happening, that's right. You've talked a lot about this, there being a time, just being a time of transformation. Is that time up until the year 2000, or does it go on beyond there? Approximately, shall we say, from your 1987 years to approximately, again, these are very arbitrary labels, and in that sense, there is not leeway for change. This is not etched in steel, but your 2021 years. That period. And when is this transformation consistent? Is it just that more people will become more and more, and there will be more, of course, dimension, consciousness of more people on the planet? Yes, and the idea of simply being that individuals will begin one by one to recognize that they create their own realities anyway. And begin to do so consciously in a loving way. And then they will attract other individuals of like mind and build, shall we say, from the ground up, go away with speaking, a community. This can become the global world community. I experienced something last Sunday, as a matter of fact, in this room, called Vivations, or Reversing. Yes. And I was able to go beyond. I mean, it's just an incredible experience for me. And it was total ecstasy, bliss, love, the universe, the horse, everything that I could ever imagine. Oh, love. And I'm not sure why I was able to experience it or simply because you all, you can paint it. It shows you beyond the shadow of a doubt that you do, and you can continue to create it right now. I'm having a little bit of trouble because some things are happening to me spiritually and fourth dimensionally right now very, very fast. And I'm having trouble integrating it into my normal life. You know, it's just, I've even wanting to continue with the job that I'm in, or I'm just having a lot of trouble with balance right now. Do you have any suggestions? Oh, again, our standard question would come into play. Are you doing in life what excites you the most? No. Oh, is this job a reflection of something that excites you? No. When will you do? What excites you? Very soon. That is it. Then you will have the reality you prefer. That's your way, that ecstasy. That is it. So I need to step the trust that I'll know what that will be when it's... Do not have to. We never say you have to, however, that will make it most conducive. So trusting is the key. I beg you. And again, remember, you always trust in something. What you consider doubt is not a lack of trust. Did we uninfinite trust in that which you don't prefer? So we are very good at trust when you're not rusty at all. Simply now, if you find yourself trusting in something you don't prefer, ask yourself why. You will get an answer. It will render down to a limiting belief that you are creating ingrained from your childhood which no longer serves you. And by simply having the recognition that yes, I do have this limiting belief, you can then change it. I guess the bottom line is fear of giving up what I already have. But do you recognize that happens by convention? And when you speak of reversing, you reverse in every given moment. You only have a seeming continuity. You are recreating your reality anew in every given moment. And the good news is that means in any given moment you can change it. Each moment is discrete. A. crystallized creation. You however create what you label, continuity between those crystallized discrete creations. But if you allow yourself to see how loose it really is, you can change it in any given creation and then proceed with that positive continuity. Right now. Thank you. Oh, thank you very much. After it's done, we will pause by a short break. And resume contact in 10 to 15 of your minutes.
