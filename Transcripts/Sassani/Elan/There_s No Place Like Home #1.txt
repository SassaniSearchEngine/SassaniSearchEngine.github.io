 All right, I'll say greetings this evening of your time. How are you all? Oh, thank you very much. Quiet alive this evening. Relax. Find a comfortable position within your seat. Before we begin, perhaps what you may call the excursion, picture the following idea. See your physical body floating wherever it is you wish in the water and space. Use your imagination. As you do begin to form the image of yourself floating, begin to see yourself surrounded by a blue-white bubble with, again, what you consider to be your body within the center. Now come to realize that this bubble of energy, this energy, seed is not indeed empty and in fact contains a jelly-like substance that you are now suspended within, that now supports in that sense your weight from all sides, from all angles, thereby still maintaining the sense of floating with no resistance, you are simply suspended within the blue-white gelatinous substance of the bubble itself. Slowly as you perceive against what you consider to be your skin, the jelly. Begin to envision your skin dissolving, the barrier that separates you from the environment of the bubble itself. Allow it to begin to dissolve so that a bit at a time the gelatinous material of the bubble begins to permeate your body. And there is no longer a fine separation between the two. Allow them to now begin to melt and mesh and combine. Slowly begin to release the sense of your body itself as this fluid permeates every cell, every core puzzle, every molecule, every atom, every atomic space, every subatomic particle, every super-strain of your being. Allow it to be bathed in the blue-white substance of this bubble and no longer perceive yourself as the collection of parts that you do. But allow yourself to now be perceived as the bubble itself. One idea, one expression, homogenous throughout. Understand the following. You are pure consciousness itself. You express the reality that you perceive that you exist within from your consciousness. Feel how it feels to be one with this idea. Feel the liberation of being one unbroken complete statement, complete idea. No longer placing an emphasis on one part versus another part, but truly seeing yourself as the one whole being that you are floating within a reality that is in fact also made of you. Feel how it feels. Now slowly begin to reform within the substance of the bubble what you consider to be your physical body. Understanding that you have now smoothed out the wrinkles, that you have in that sense homogenized what was formerly many different ideas. And as you reform your physical body within the bubble, understand that you are reburthing yourself literally for you are forming from the entire substance that you are. The new preferred you and allowing everything else to be valid to exist, but no longer need be incorporated or incorporated within your body. They are existing within your consciousness, but as you reform your perception of your body, do so only from preference, only from excitement for you are literally recreating yourself in this moment. Allow the sense of your body to begin to return and begin now to once again feel as that body. And slowly begin to allow the substance of the bubble to begin to dissolve now that it has in that sense served its purpose. At your own pace again re-acclimate to your environment, to your room, to your chair. Now before we proceed, first of all Maui is your tape machine functioning bubble. All right. When we last, Bashar and myself interacted with you, many of you, in transporting your consciousness to our mother craft, we did so after laying down a foundation. That foundation was the idea that you are home itself and that home is nowhere in that sense to go to. You bring it with you. You are the home. The reality moves around you. Perhaps you can label that process a style of grounding before embarking upon such a trip to our ship. It is our desire that you are firmly grounded in your reality. For that is where you have chosen to be and where you will act from. So therefore what has occurred up till this point in this interaction is an alignment with yourself, with your wholeness, with your wholeness, but also by virtue of the fact that the bubble was blue, white in nature, was also an alignment and a direct identification with your planet itself, your home away from home. That in a sense is a form of grounding. So we are now prepared to proceed. For we do again continue, understand that one of our craft has been brought into your general vicinity for perhaps a reference point. Perhaps you can say it is colloquially speaking part near your planet of Mars at this time. Your imagination, a tool that we have discussed many times as being just that, a tool, an instrument, a useful barometer will as we proceed in this interaction make its contribution. We request that you allow it to do so without invalidating. That is your own particular way to cater your experience to the math experience that we are enjoying. So therefore do not feel that anything from your imagination is an interruption. For if you do then your experience may be of being interrupted. But simply if you will understand that it is an essential part of your experience of the process and allow it free range. This is what we will deliver to you the maximal effect from this particular journey. Now at this timing this journey is one of energy and consciousness. So perhaps from the standpoint of your physical body it will seem in some sense that you are still sitting in your seat. But understand that you will be aboard that craft. We are literally physically in proximity and you will be aboard that craft. What you consider to be your history will be enhanced by this experience. It will be a memory and you will have the full effect of having been there. But if you are willing to loosen up and allow your imagination to work full time you will in your consciousness very clearly have discrete experiences. So therefore allow the free reign of your imagination without invalidating and understand that no matter how you may choose to interpret and create it later you will be aboard that craft. Close your eyes if you have not already done so. Picture yourself once again and for the first time as many facets of one whole crystal gathering yourself together becoming an integral part so to speak of the one whole crystal that will comprise for the purposes of this interaction our scalp craft. Some of the facets lying just next to you may indeed be familiar but there may here and there be other facets which are not. Those are in a sense the facets which will represent other individuals who are either not physically present right now or who will seemingly partake of this interaction later in your tape format. But nevertheless it is one event one trip and because time streams between our society and your society are quite arbitrary everything fit and it all works out just fine. Or again you may recognize some of the facets next to you you may not either way you are intimately related. As you picture yourself gathering together as the master crystal begin to allow round in about you the formation of a grey mithy fog and through that fog just at the other side of it perhaps in your mind I see vaguely the room that you are in begin to fade from your view so that your entire perception is filled with this grey limbo fog completely allow any idea of a physical room to dissolve so that you now only exist at the center of your being surrounded by this isolation field and understand the following. While you are within this field you literally are everywhere and nowhere at the same time for this field factors out time and space and allows you to be pure being met without the definitional boundary of a place in space and time so right now you are at your center point where all reality all possibility all dimensions all experience is equally distant from you and therefore equally you are truly at the center of the universe that you are. The ship that has been brought into your vicinity for the purposes of briefing you is approximately five to seven thousand of your feet lost approximately one tenth of that distance in diameter it is cylindrical and a two within a two within a two thirty two all together thereby giving you a sixty deck cross section the center of the cylinder the central core of the vessel itself which perhaps you can say to some degree will contain for lack of better terminology the power unit will be up for all decks so therefore the concave surface of the cylinder will be colloquially speaking at both ends are what you would label perhaps the bridge control center whatever you wish as well as center region itself see in your mind I as you begin to reappear in time and space just outside the vessel begin to see the vessel itself in our ancient language the vibration that would identify this particular vessel would translate into your language as the solar wind a ship that is quite familiar with your system begin now to allow on that your cells to move toward the vessel and as you approach it out for most all perhaps you will perceive an aperture and opening through which on mass you all will pass simply allow yourself to be attracted into the substance of the ship itself as you in that sense do materialize within the outermost deck of the ship now contained within the substance of the ship itself or allow yourself to once again become the discrete individual that you consider yourself as you do so understand that you have been to our realm and that what you are feeling and experiencing is a direct result of our projection of consciousness it is our exact joy to have you aboard our craft after time simply you may understand that the rules are quite loose upon the clock and that you cannot will teleport from deck to deck by simply desiring to be by simply allowing yourself to be attracted to whatever it is that will be perfect for you to interact with understand that if certain things will come as images to what you consider to be your minds are that many times we will simply be symbolic representations but they will be allow them to come in whatever form that they will allow yourself to simply be where you need to be when you need to be there for this is how we live this is our approach to reality therefore in participating with us in our reality at this time you also have the opportunity to loosen up to let go of what you would call an agenda and simply spontaneously flow within the substance of our class allow yourself to be attracted to whatever regions that you will and understand that there are many individuals that are in that sense partaking of you relishing you perhaps at first you will proceed a central fog through which many figures will begin to emerge but allow your imagination to create the emergence of the awareness of our presence in whatever way that it will. If there are any particular individuals that you wish to interact with understand that simply by allowing yourself to feel to feel how those individuals allow you to feel that that will immediately attract them physically to you and that you can then directly interact face to face with them understand that the nature of our particular consciousness is such that we always experience 100% complete unconditional love and what you are feeling is that love washing over you permeating and allowing you to identify with your own particular portion of that unconditional love therefore there is nothing overwhelming about it simply enjoys swimming and understand also what perhaps you are feeling is a lack of hesitation a entire lack of what you sometimes called out for in our particular approach we are fully committed in any moment to anything that we are there for a while this feeling to emerge with it understand that the many things that you may be beholden will include our civilization but that there are many other representatives or many other civilizations aboard the craft at this time in that sense waiting to meet with you waiting to interact with you so therefore you may see perhaps a few things that are a bit unfamiliar simply allow yourself to trust that you have attracted exactly the type of interaction that will not only benefit you most greatly but the other individuals involved as well also understand that we do not keep our children locked up at home and therefore they are on a board the craft as well and you may in that sense interact with them as well as the children for again many other other civilizations. Be aware of any exchanges that take place whether you choose to give a gift or whether you receive one and make note of this involvement or there are literal exchanges taking place. if Allowing the continuation of the experiences that you are partaking of right now. Begin to be aware that the groups that you have in that sense transported with are beginning to move toward a central group. As you in that sense integrate yourself back with the group, you may now perceive that the room that you are entering together may perhaps visualize. Allow yourselves to come in and make yourself comfortable. Now that you are all conglomerated in one place at one time so speak, understand that you are within what you make a locally called. The conference room for the association of world intelligence therefore pay particular attention to what you see, to who you see, to the many different styles and types of beings that are present as well as those that are shall we say colloquially speaking, holographically reconstruct it and sharing this interaction with you in that format remotely. As you interact and go about your business interacting in this room, in this format, we again remind you of five ideas. Allow yourselves to continue your interaction and have what I am sharing simply be in the background. Number one, unconditional love yourself and others. Number two, everything is synchronous. As though that you are so. Number three, in any given month from what is available, do what it's like to see within the integrity, do what it's like. Number four, all situations have no built in need. Number four, the presence is not every source of the power. Now is the only experiential power there is and you get to choose how you will exist in that manner. Again, reiterating what we translate into your language and of association membership, continue to interact. Pay particular attention to the lights and sounds and allow your senses to become fully involved with what you are experiencing. Thank you. So, I am Kinda Thisahl. Begin now to gather yourself back together. As you do reform the Master Crystal, once again surround yourself with the grave, this time however, maintain some awareness of what is outside that box and as a unit, pick yourself beginning to drift through each deck one at a time. You are now nearing the periphery and soon will exit the craft. Feel the membrane of the outer hull of the craft as it caresses you as you pass through. As you now materialize outside the craft before beginning our final approach to your planet, perhaps you can look a little bit to the left at what you consider to be your mark for you generally do not have such a good deal. Notice the many canal and features that perhaps you are not aware of before. So many new discoveries are about to come out about this time. Begin to allow the energy speed that you all are the Master Crystal to begin now to approach your planet Earth. Before you in that sense begin to enter the outer atmosphere of your Earth. Allow the craft that you are to hang in space and behold your planet, the emerald green crystalline planet Earth and understand the following. Though it is our joy to interact with you, though it is our ecstasy to interchange and exchange with you. Your planet is your planet. It is the point. Our interactions are peripheral in that sense to the main point before you. The planet you see before you and understand that we view this planet in its splendor, in its beauty, allow yourself now to begin to perceive that joy, that attraction, that lovingness for this is where you have chosen to express your consciousness in this particular period so to speak of the life of your soul so to speak. Therefore you are not leaving some place wondrous to return to some place Monday. This is the splendorous wondrous place that you have chosen to explore. As we now begin to enter into your atmosphere, begin to feel the joy of that choice, begin to feel the anticipation of bringing back the experience that you have, but bringing it back to the Earth that you have chosen to exist upon for your willingness to do, to act, to be in this world, on this planet, using the motivation from the experiences that you have and mid-wiping them into your reality with action is what will change and already as transform your entire reality. So before we begin to re-materialize in this world, I will simply ask you all now to repeat after me. There's no place like home. Now perhaps you will do that again. Do you proceed? Allow yourselves to begin to re-materialize in your room and also understand you also have your title for tonight's session. Before we proceed to the interaction, allow us to also say that perhaps a bit sneakily there is a double meaning in that title for again. You are home and there is no place that you need go to that is home. Home is not even a place, but this is the chosen reality. So therefore it is perhaps you can say temporary logic. As you do begin to re-create the room round and about you and allow the isolation field to dissolve completely, allow us to thank you for your willingness to share with us on a level that we consider most intimate, where we have accepted your invitation to interact with you in this format as it comes. And it is as joyful to us that you have accepted our invitation. To willingness and the degree of willingness that you have to validate the experience that has just occurred. We'll add unto you, unto the equation that you define yourself to be as any other memory would. Therefore you may now within the totality that you consider yourself to be understand that what we have just shared is a valid memory, is an experience. I thank you. We all thank you. How now may I be of service to you? You should have. First I want to thank you for that. And you as well. I want to ask about the first being that you have startled me because it wasn't what I expected to be. Well done. And congratulations. You see, the mom needed to change and it was much darker than the night. I mean, and the guest I wanted to ask about the, what was the significance of the pandemic and the variation of this month? Do perhaps speak a bit louder. Okay. The significance of the pendant and the scrot. It was brown and they had, it was similar to the triangle and say, but the circle wasn't like any of the templates that I could be different. And I wonder if there's significance to the variation in the sense, perhaps you can say there's more representative of your own discrete vibration. And if you are in that sense to draw your perception of what you are saying, what was shared with you is a personal meditative, perhaps you can say colon or cymbal, that will enable you by concentrating upon it to reach very deep meditative state. Oh, thank you. In terms of the zing, we will allow you, when you are in those deep meditative state, to have to be, or you have established contact. We thank you. You're sure? Okay. Thank you. And I wanted to share my interaction initially with the children. And my joy and love to them. And the first thing that happened was I went to a place excited by Kaja and Misha and found them, like on these velvet pillows, kept sitting there. Well, in a sense, that was your purification. We have no velvet, we have no velvet. I gave it to them, too, in my imagination. And they were talking to children who wanted me to tell stories, and I told stories. And we'll continue tonight in dream states. Oh, and perhaps you will be told a few yourself. Yes, and that was my wish, is my wish. And they said, what is that? What is that all around you? And I looked and I saw the berries that I brought with me, and that I hadn't noticed that had come with me. And I let them all go, the fairies all go with the children and view with them. And that was a lot of fun. Oh, yes, for that, that one. And the theater place with the association. There was so much going on that I didn't want to try to focus on certain things. You will find it to be a complete statement, which perhaps will necessitate due to your linear perspective and unfolding. So it will become more apparent in a linear sense as you look back on it, and this applies due to all. Much time was unfolded in what you may have perceived to be a short period of time. Our experience of it was far longer than yours. Thank you. Yes. Oh, thank you. And the last experience briefly was when we were moving through the atmosphere and the outer membrane of the ship right after we were looking at Mars. There was, I saw an image of a hand, the knuckles of hand with rings, all the way on all the fingers like bright. Oh, did you see any craft? It seems very clear, like an almost transparent craft. There were several other craft presidents in the area, behold. Do you have any more information about that hand? Well, in a sense, it is our perception that that was your interpretation of a craft. That is why they asked. Yeah, that could be. And what was there of the children, one particular child that stood out? Yes. Oh. And we exchanged gifts and they gave me two things. Well, the children gave me a hat that was triangular, kind of very soft, but triangular and purple. Oh, perhaps you can say our version of a party patch. Oh, we're very nutty. And it was a symbol of their consciousness, their giving me access or not. To your inner child, yes. But also, again, the act, the significance of the hat being in that particular shape, is in a sense a lens for what you have formally called your wizard cast, that particular cone, shall we say, shape, focuses energy in a particular way. Hence, the translation into your society of what you call wizard hat, witch hat, and then also, interestingly enough, perhaps more historically than presently, when individuals were considered less than smart, they were sat in the corner with such a hat. There was, shall we say, perhaps a misunderstanding, but the basic overall reasoning was the particular way in which that shape focuses, literally the electromagnetic field of your planet itself. So perhaps you may now understand when you are partying in the act, the water pointing in it. And the other gift they offered me was in the association, in the room there with the association assemblism. There was a being who gave me, it was like an ancient being, very wise energy and gave me a very smooth, heavy stone, carbon, in like almost a triathrily clover kind of shape. In a sense, you may understand that to be a balance for as the hat in a sense represents your upper connection, so to speak, the stone, so to speak, represents the grounding at the same time, thereby completing the circuit. Thank you. Oh, we thank you. Shut it. Oh, very nice. I'm Hyalon. And who you greet? Well, I made it from the Antucket. I got guidance to come tonight, so I came. Have a share? You would have been there either, wasn't it? Right. I felt, um, just going on to the ship, I felt a little bit of hesitation. All right. A little bit of expectation. Oh. And a little fear about one. I think about, um, I think that the fear was about, um, when we had spoke before about my connection with Ali Osil and my, um, if my willingness is to channel her in such a manner as, um, as Andrew channels you. And, um, since I feel excitement and fear about that, and by the way, you feel excitement, but when you interpret it negatively, it comes off as anxiety. But anxiety and excitement are the exact same energy, one with a positive interpretation, one with a big. So it is pure excitement, but you could. Thank you for that. Thank you. Good. Well, once I was on the ship, um, I am very excited. Oh. The only thing that physically might. Oh, holding back out. Yeah. And then I saw Ali Osil and I got very excited and, um, didn't think about the back much more. No, I got very excited. Like I was an old friend and how wonderful and she was very giddy and I had, and then the boy in extra trust would be like, by the way, we are all perhaps to use that term very giddy. Also, understand the micro cosmic analogy that has occurred as you have a hesitation as you have a feel. If you are still willing to step forward as an analogy, break through, so to speak, you will always find that degree of support and unconditional love from our end. Yeah. Therefore, this can be now extrapolated to your physical situation and your willingness to grounded in actions here on earth is the point. Do go see. Yeah. Also, who was with her was Petiva, who I believe is my future self as a very small child. In a sense. Very creative. And, um, and then she brought me Ali Osil to me, um, who I, I believe was a male. Um, maybe her other half of her male. I'm not sure how that works. Well, in this case, we will request that you ask her. You have a direct line. Okay. Um, and she, she was showing me to all these people like she was so excited and I was so surprised that she was so excited. Why? I don't know. Well, again, now you have a taste of our ever ongoing, ever-bethic. It reminded me of myself when I was a child and I would get so excited that I'd almost hyperventilate me. You're welcome to sound the analogy is quite accurate and that is the Petiva energy within you. Oh. The inner child. Because when I was a child, my parents would give me half a value to calm down. Oh. I'm excited I got it. Oh, what? That's one way that it would I suppose? I guess you thought. Um, so that was wonderful. And then, um, and then we met, I met a woman or I received, it looked like a goddess with a cape on and I met her the other night also and she, um, almost was like my ancient self or my higher self in a sense or that that's my, that's my sense of it. That will be with an analogy again as you have stated, the goddess, god, goddess within, but also some ancient times. Yeah, very ancient times and very, very proud person and in a sense of incredible integrity. She gave me a, um, a sapphire. All the energies are in place for you to draw directly from. And are you in that sense to feel perhaps as you sometimes call it the need for that type of support that is an energy within yourself that you can invoke tap into. And if you are willing to match, transform and express that same degree of, as you have said, prime, but not on this. No, it wasn't that type of pride. It was like a lioness type lioness. The only word I can think of. Oh, um, but the staff hired to meet men. And she, it was in her third eye, the staff, I, and she removed it from her third eye and gave it to me to put in place in my third eye. But this will also have, shall we say, some degree of a connection to what you call the root chakra as well. How so? I don't feel a connection. Describe the sapphire. Um, it was almost oval. Coloration. Um, purplish. Oh, simply again for the purposes of practicality. Also be aware of the root chakra. And as you are meditating and in touch with many aspects, the connection will become obvious. But it has to do with while having your head in the clouds firmly grounding yourself within and through the actions on your earth. Right. That's the sense I got when we were leaving the craft looking at the earth that, um, in a sense, I'm to bring those gifts in me to manifest them on the physical plane of the earth. And that's why I've chosen to, um, have my soul in this particular planet right now. And then allow me to express my joy in having done my job. Congratulations. Yeah. That feel. Yeah. Is there anything? Um, there's one other thing that is coming up. Okay. Um, am I, um, in a sense, we talked about me having a lot of time. We talked about me having a future self on S. Sani. Am I a being who is from S. Sani in a sense? I mean, I know we're not from anywhere, but who has lived there prior and is visiting me or if I've been. You were translated as a future one. But from that perspective on that end, again, it becomes a bit more arbitrary and may seem from that end that it has emanated from that end. But that will always be the case whichever end you are on. And is there any symbol that I could use to start? Um, I plan on maybe, yeah, tomorrow morning to, um, to start. I've connected with all the other meditation every day now and I can feel her presence and feel the energy moving through my body. Is there a symbol that I may use when I actually start to channel it verbally out loud? Perhaps what you would call a double tetrahedron, which is two three-sided pyramids with a triangular base, base to base. It, in a sense, is a side bin or funnel from the non-physical to the physical through the center of your being. As a symbol that will be. Is that clear? Yes. We thank you. We also again remind you that the symbol of a black triangle upon a black triangle. Black background with a back liking of Booher allowing the triangle to stand out in relief upon the black background is another vibrational shall we stay simple that will call you to our particular realm. Thank you. Thank you for facilitating our journey to me. Thank you for participating. When, after we entered the craft, even before we spoke about the children, my first explorations to look for the children. You will find others as well to have had that common experience. And I did find children in what I perceived to be a play area. I'm playing with faults of mine. I was throwing them back and forth and I watched for a while and then one thrown to me. I was a little hesitant for that thought it might be like hot. Oh no. Like electric? We would not do that to you. But I noticed it looked like, I don't know if someone said there was a wall, but it seemed like a wall of boxes of different colors that could be chosen by the children of the mother. And inside each box of containment of a ball of light, there was two minutes none of movement. It was very fluid. Well, as we have sometimes described and named, there is a form of light perhaps you can call it that we will refer to colloquially for lack of a better term as liquid light. And you are perceiving perhaps what you would have interpreted to be a particular area whereby a volume of that substance was particularly quote unquote stored so to speak. I felt very malleable as well. You will sometimes find the balls per se to change shape very greatly as they are in mid-flight. They change shape and are affected directly by the consciousness of the participant. And in fact are perceived as spheres because that is the concentration of the liquid light. Also when I went to the gathering conference room, there were beams in there, but I was totally drawn to one. Describe. It looked like an epsilon beam, the type that I have been on the t-shirt that Maui has channeled for. My sense is that it is a female, the sort of grayish white skin, very rounded head, very large, a felt of dark, almost on the black eyes. And I went to this beam and I felt totally attracted to it. And we were sharing telepathically. I asked her if I could just explore her energy field. And she said yes. Of course. And I outstretched my hand and was just mesmerized by the love that was just bathing. Did you perceive her house? Yes. Describe. How many fingers? Oh. I don't know, maybe four, three or four. Perhaps four. Do understand that you are interacting with a particular version, not often discussed by us. And we will not elaborate too much, but of a member of the reticulose device. Can you tell me something about the beam, the name? Perhaps the idea is that that beam will often act as a conduit toward other forms of life. There will be a front person, so to speak, many times in the interactions between your civilization and reticulum civilization. It is very often perceived by individuals who physically interact with the reticulum as a maternal comforting energy. I felt very much that it was being a female and that she loves me. Oh. I was very open to my interaction. I was also interested in an earlier portion of the point of the balloon line. And I would try to find how you serve food. What did you find? Not much. We do not eat that often anymore. It is remnant or vestigial forma, for we are now beginning to absorb energy directly as we consciously begin to drop external symbols as having a need for an external substance. However, perhaps you can say for your convenience, there was a smorgasbord for you. But looking for our food, perhaps we will keep you looking for them. Well, I just wanted to thank you for this journey. I very much felt the unconditional love, no one was explaining me. And when you felt it, you matched it. You created your own version of it to be able to even feel it. So understand the value is that you now know beyond the shadow of the valley that you contain that unconditional love and your willingness to express it to yourself and others. Now that you know it's there, we'll have many beneficial and immediate results. We thank you. We love you. Greetings. I enjoyed our trip to your ship very much. But it's not about that I want to ask tonight. Oh, what? It's about our conversation a couple of weeks ago with my friend Bob, where we were talking about quantum physics in the pyramid. He has built a very nice pyramid out of acrylic. And after your suggestion that we top that pyramid with an octahedral crystal to make a cap for the pyramid. And shall we say more ancient, alkaline-bian versions? Exactly. We plan on tapping into that crystal with a copper rod, extended down into the top one third of the pyramid into a copper block, as you should suggest it. Well the suggestion was that you continue it down to a copper base. Okay, to the copper base. Okay. But perhaps if you should choose to take measurements, one third of the way down would be the, shall we say, primary focus area whereby perhaps you will get physical measurements. Okay. Well that's what I wanted to ask about. How should we begin to explore the energy of this device? In whatever way your imagination provides, in what is available, then when you are, and shall we say willing to take those steps, get those results, we can perhaps discuss the more diverse ideas that perhaps you would not think of. But for now, use any means at your disposal. Take the actions. Take the readings. Take the connections within you and the supposition from the results that you get. That will be the first step. Or perhaps the second. The building was the first. I see. We will involve you in the process rather than simply add it up. Yeah, that's what I expect. Would you? Would this bring us out of belief of something that we might label tetrahedral geometry? Which involves placing a pyramid at the longitude of between 19 and 20 degrees to harness the earth energy? It is not our awareness that the terminology in that case would be tetrahedral. But there will be an effect from doing so. I see. Okay. Well, I'll experiment with this on my own when I count my measurements. So I'll ask you again. Okay. But by all means, do have fun doing something. Okay. Thank you. Oh, we thank you, excellent. Align. Shutting. Ice. I am. Breathing. I thoroughly enjoyed being aboard the ship and I appreciate the guidance coming back because it was a little hard for me to leave. Oh, do you understand though that where you were going to your earth is truly the point? Yeah. That will remind you was inspired me to realign to wanting to bring back the experience here the degree that I felt is there. Well again, that is the point. And the grounding of the ideas is the only thing that then enables you to share it with other people. All right. I want to share a little bit and then I'll have a little question about it. This time I was drawn immediately to the room with the children. And I felt like I got into my usual habit of wanting to give and then I felt immediately that I was just being given to by their joy, by the life, by the freedom. And I just want to send my thanks to them. It was pure delight. You understand that your willingness to receive was a service to them by allowing them the sharing of the giving. We thank you. Then I went to a scene like a large room where I was dancing. I just lifted off the restrictions that I had, any restrictions I had brought with me. And I felt it was either an exercise or a sport with a stuff, a fresh and room where it was everything. Perhaps for a label, a recreation group. For you make very readily in that space, redefine who you are and recreate. And I, it brought out the memory of the dancer in me, which I have not manifested in this lifetime. And it was such a delight to be in that body. Well, understand that is the body that you're in. Otherwise, it would not explain you. We weren't given bodies to go into there. What I am saying is that the body you are sitting in is also the body of the dancer. If you should choose, now that you understand that to express it. You need not keep it on the mental plane. Your excitement about the dancing and recognition of connection to it is your indication that you can do it. And simply now you're willing to act, ground it, attract whatever symbols through synchronicity you will. We'll be able to allow you to express it should you choose. It is nothing that is barred from. Okay. Then I also saw something about food. It reminded me of the restaurant aboard the Star Trek ship. It's so good. It was really nice. And I also saw a little clearly one of the beings like who's done one of my issues. My meeting with Shira came a little later and I really saw her hair. Color. White. And I was a little surprised that we didn't connect at first as soon as I entered the ship. But I don't know what that was about. Time. Okay. Any particular reasons? It allowed you to get your feet wet, have a good time, walk around and then have some comfort. Okay. Last night I channeled her. Thanks. Yes? You're asking. I'm thoroughly exhausted. Time when I think I can't do anything. And I sat on my bed and I spoke and I felt her with me. Thanks. And when I was aboard the ship I just felt a, I just felt as firmly rooted with each other now. Did you join? There was some kind of contact between our bodies whether it was hugging each other, arms of each other or shoulder to shoulder something. Oh. Okay. So I just felt that her oneness in some way, not exactly, but connection. It was beautiful. Absolutely beautiful. Then when we went to the conference room with the auditorium or whatever it was, I saw myself at a podium seeking. And that's what my question would be about. Was that symbolic or did that happen? Well, in a sense it occurred upon the crop. But it is also symbolic of what you are now choosing to express down here, so to speak. Okay. Obviously. Yes. And I felt that all that was going on was a little inspiration, big inspiration, to bring back here. That's it. Again. The unconditional love, the joy, the freedom. Did you feel that love? Yes. We again remind you all. When you felt it, perhaps perceiving it was from us, you created it. You matched it. You created your version of it. When you felt it, that was your direct evidence that it is that simple to recreate it within yourself. And you can do so any time. You can do it as a symbol if you wish, but that is not necessary. The love you felt was the unconditional love of yourself, of all that is, of all at one. Your version of it. I see myself beginning to do channel and to groups. Well, how exciting? Yeah. I see myself. Coming. Oh, coming. Oh. That's a good idea. This is a practice in my bedroom for her. Whoa, if you say so. I don't know if that's your question or if it comes to the living spirit. At one point when I believe I was with Shira, she was introducing me to a male. And last night she had said something about that to me that I was going to meet some kind of someone who was my father there or something. I don't know what that was and I did not get a clear picture on this. Play around with it. All right. Is there anything else? That's as much as I remember. Oh. Did you have a good time? I had a wonderful time. Oh, thank you. As did we all. Was there anyone present who actually in that sense interacted with myself? Yes, I did. This is Groff. Well, it was a memory of when I first met you and the land because, well, you are a land present when I first encountered you about a year ago. Now perhaps you perceived Veshal and not myself? Well, no, I feel like it was both of you. But it was, but Shira was definitely there. And it wasn't so much visual, although I was trying to orient myself visually. And I kept being sort of like motorcycle assets that you guys were wearing. How great did you do? I didn't know where I was getting that. They are simply symbols of your idea or interpretation of what you would consider to be our garments. They are not person. Well, I think we all had this interchange about that and kind of laughed about it and stuff. But then, you know, well, I stopped trying to orient myself visually. And then it was more just feelings anyway about, you know, the three of us and what we had experienced in the past and seeing each other again. Now did you see any of what you would proceed to be, though perhaps seeming out of place Indian God? Excuse me, Indian guys? Yes. There are overlapping dimensions of experience. So there may be many different presentations upon our craft that may seem to have nothing to do with our civilization. Yes, I did. But do you mean American Indian? Simply describe what you have seen. I saw a big stone, a thing like figure that kept going from like a fire and transparency in back in the stone like it was sort of an Egyptian thing like so to speak. Lion, lion, flash fire. It will have what you would call lion. So, so to speak, Native American Indian. Um, yeah. I got the, maybe it was more Native Egyptian Indian. In the sense. That was the first sort of thing I encountered besides you guys. But in between that there was a whole slew of esosani sort of light, luminescence, eggs sort of beings that took me and glided around with me and it became real apparent that there's this block in me and I felt the unconditional love and became aware of it about five seconds before you brought it up. And I felt it and I know it would have just dissolved me if I, you know, could release this block I'm having. And what did you do? I haven't released it yet. What is your perception of what the block is? Self-doubt. What does it block you from doing? Loving myself. Loving myself. So, then if you are simply willing to skip a step and simply do it, love yourself, there is no block. When you assume there is a block and then do not love yourself by that assumption, you get the effect of the block. When you in that sense are willing to only unconditionally love yourself, cut yourself slack, allow yourself the opportunity to see where perhaps you are not living up to your standard and forgiving yourself and having the clear intention to now embody the preferred you. You simply express that love and release the block. Does that make sense or is that too simple? No. It makes a lot of sense. So simply allow whatever you consider to be self-doubt, judgment to be the opportunities for self-forgiveness and self-validation and self-unconditional love. If you unconditionally love yourself, there is absolutely nothing that you can do or think that will then result in the withdrawal of that month. So when you find the withdrawal, stop yourself in your tracks and decide, do I really wish to withdraw my self-love? Is what I have done really so serious that it is worth the entire withdrawal of my self-love? You will generally find the answer is no. It is not. I have done this. I wish to not do it again. I will not do it again next time. Therefore it has served me and move on. Is that of a sentence? It is. I still find it somewhat challenging when dealing with the unconscious and the shadow of the psyche to... The unconscious becomes conscious as you are willing to use your creation in the way that we are sharing. Rather than judging yourself and then judging yourself or judging yourself, you can use that judgment. You can use that creation in a positive way to define what you must believe and change it if you don't wish to believe it. It is becoming more of a possibility certainly moment by moment in my conscious state to help you to help finally disembark from this ancient pattern of limitation. Well, when you simply decide in the moment to transform and do so, the quote unquote stuff that you have accumulated will simply come up in the form of negative emotions. When you feel those negative emotions as you feel, then realize the timing is the perfect time to deal with it. And again, remember that your emotions are a direct window to your belief. You can always say, alright, alright, I feel this, allow myself to feel it. Now what must I believe? Then you use it and when you transform that belief, there is one less thing from your historical past. So you need not go through the motions of creating a process, they will automatically come to the surface at the perfect timing in the form of emotions that you put a negative interpretation of. Then you can ask yourself, why am I doing this? And then choose to either continue to do it or change it. But at least you're taking back conscious commandments. The unconscious becomes conscious when you allow it to in the form of what you call negative emotions. So, are you, am I finding an origin point from these negative emotions? Well, perhaps there will be an identification many times when you fish out ably to the historical event that perhaps you created it with. But the historical event itself is not the point. So sometimes you will not even need to know historically how it happened. Simply now that you know that it has happened and you wish to change it is really enough. If you attach an anchor to a past with it, you drag yourself back to that path rather than allowing the message itself to be the point. Is that what I keep doing, isn't that? Well, that is what you have kept doing. I assume you will no longer. Before I left for South Dakota the last time I saw you, you gave my friend Jim a message for me to pay attention to the rattle. The image of the shaking of the rattle. And I had an experience where there was a rattling that woke me up from a dream. It wasn't, I just wanted to touch face with you about that. It was your own rattle. And you were in that sense making a lot of noise and saying, look out here I come. I felt like it was chicken wire against a window rattling. I mean, is that, am I in tune with the process? Nice. Now will you use that and go forth with that same conviction? It comes and goes. Always. Sometimes strong. But on the ship tonight, these four beings gave me that same symbol that the rattle awakens me to in my dream that night two, three months ago. They ballast my heart with four directions. They gave me actual weight. And my heart chakra. So I, you know, I have a lot of hesitation about using this information and this process I've had out there. Do you understand that? Why is the hesitation? That in some way what the experience was about was repeating an old negative pattern? Do you understand that you give yourself the opportunity to choose whether or not you wish to do so? And it is not that everything that you participate in is the way it must be. It is an opportunity to discern is this me or is this no longer me? And the making of the decision that this is no longer me is as much a commitment and a decision. Exactly. Yeah. It is. It's been a really challenging process for me because there, it seems to me that this teacher figure to me comes from judgment. My problem is trusting whether it is intelligence. Your discernment will always tell you how it relates to you. For no matter what is being taught only can you know what is relative to you. You need not if something is not relevant toss it all out. You can simply take and pick and choose what is relevant and allow the rest to be relevant for someone else. It may not be as you say or not. So therefore begin to trust how you feel. Begin to trust your heart of hearts. You know what you are doing. Thank you. I started seeking truth in my experience with reference to what you are saying. It makes a lot of sense to me. We thank you for creating. I have one more question. That's why I was everybody. Recently I read an article about Mars and the pyramids in the face and the structure of the geometric pattern 19.5 which may be what you were talking about earlier with the pyramid. To some degree. Somewhere between 19 and 20 degrees. And it really picked my interest. I mean I had a huge response to the possibility of what this meant. And since then you may have talked about this cave with my friends Jim who might have asked you about it. He has discovered just near here. We both want to go into the cave and explore the possibility of traveling to the fourth dimension. Well you need not shall we say go to any particular place to do so. But should you wish to utilize that as a symbol that is one possibility. The idea is this relationship we can have with stone and the possibility of information that stone is available to us in stone. And so that's why we were drawn to go to the cave. Because as with it seems that the idea about free energy seems to be in these equations of geometric patterns and all this information are encoded to us through the civilizations in stone. Well in a sense you may understand that should you enter such a structure and in a very quiet meditative state per se. You will generally literally feel physical vibrations. And even that sense you simply allow yourself to match them and become one with them. In a sense perhaps you can say you can then open up dialogue with the store house that you are sticking up. But we could do that sitting anywhere. But if that symbol is in that sense attractive use it. Is that cave's mandate? Basically, yes. But there are other overtones of other shall we say external influence in terms of the resonance idea of the change. Extra-trestial you mean? To some degree yes. Is it in any danger? That is up to your planet and your civilization. Well they are doing construction right? That is what we mean. There is some possibility. Thank you. We thank you as well. At this time we will pause for a short break of 10 to 15 of your minutes of counting and resume contact at that time.
