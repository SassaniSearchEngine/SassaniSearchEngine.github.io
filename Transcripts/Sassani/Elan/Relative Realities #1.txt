 Time as you create time to exist, I do not ask how you are, for I know you are all perfect. And what I mean by this idea is simply that in any given moment you are a perfect reflection of who you are. That is, you do create the scenario that you are not being yourself. You are the most perfect reflection of that idea also. Therefore allow us to begin this interaction this evening of your time with the following entitlement if you wish. That being relative realities. Therefore in a very real sense you understand that each and every focus within a reality each and every holding in in any chosen experiential reality does in fact only encompass a small portion of the overall spectrum of all realities. And therefore there are certain qualities within a given reality in that a focus within any reality will be somewhat narrow and within and from within a given reality. Only shall we say the center colloquially seeking of the bandwidth of that reality seems most solid, seems most real and as you do deviate from shall we say the center point of any given reality. Your perception of realities that do again diverge from that center point of the one that you are experiencing have a tendency to seem most ethereal, most ghost-like, most innocent speaking about the nighttime dream, dream-like. Your reality is focused in such a way where you do grant most of your validity in your ability to grant validity to any portion of your reality to the solid, to the physical. You do perceive what you do call your sleeping dream reality, your imagination, reality adds ghost-like, ephemeral, ethereal if you will and therefore it seems to have again within your created focus less substance within our reality this is not so. Our shall we say solidity lies within being set towards those ideas, imagination, reality, our sleeping reality and our waking dream reality are one-melted reality when we do view your idea of reality being that you grant most of again the validity to the material the solid aspects to us that you seem most ghost-like, most dream-like. Therefore in order for us to communicate and in a sense shall we say the idea is to perceive each other in a face-to-face manner we must have middle ground we have described to you many times that upon instituting implementing the ideas of which we speak to you you do begin to change your vibration and in a sense shall we say accelerate that vibration to a point that will allow you to meet us on common ground therefore we will give you one other continue shall we say pointer to facilitate your creating of your reality at a more accelerated level in a sense you have heard some of these ideas before but again each and every time we do present a concept to you it is anew and can be viewed as such because you are never the person you were but a moment ago you are always recreating yourself and each and every given moment therefore the idea will simply be this by granting validity to your imagination as a real reality not shall we say a fabricated part of this real reality that you are experiencing but as real a reality by granting validity to your imagination reality and your sleeping dream reality you do swing the center point of your focus much more toward the idea of our perspective in a sense you then very literally verify yourself to a greater degree that doesn't allow us to have that middle ground for that swings you into the part of our reality that seems less ghost like to us we do have the ability as we have shared from time to time to through our technology technology technological advances densify our vibration to meet you but shall we say this can be a bit uncomfortable for us and therefore by allowing you to meet us halfway we can find the most comfortable ground in order to participate in interactions of a face to face nature with you so again that idea of validation needs to crop up within our discussions for it has many far reaching many many far reaching advantages and by learning to validate you can validate anything within your reality so the focus of the speaking of this evening will be to point yourself toward beginning to realize that your imagination is real your sleeping dream reality is real and simply by acting as though it is real allowing it to give you information that is useful and not your fantasy you raise your vibration because by acting that way again acting that way you raise your vibration in a manner we have spoken and this allows us again to find middle ground therefore pay special attention to your nice dreams from this point forward and you will find by validating what you bring back not simply analyzing them as aspects of your personality that or shall we say meanderings of your subconscious mind you will allow yourself to glean ideas that will become useful in your waking dream reality usable in your waking dream reality many times within your society there is a concern expressed by many of you about the idea of remembering your dreams that is not the idea of which we speak but as you do act within the idea of your excitement on a day to day moment to moment level any ideas that have been in part to you within the sleeping dream reality will reveal themselves within the waking dream reality but the idea is again one of your explorations of the way you have created your particular focus is timing therefore validate your timing trust in your timing if something is not coming as quick as you would like trust that idea trust that it is not the most beneficial timing for you create perfect timing even if you create shall we say aggravation and upset about that perfect timing it is still perfect and by granting your self the ability to realize it is perfect you can skip those steps of self aggravation therefore again this also applies to your day to day reality you will always have full abundance what you need when you need it you will also always have what you want but the idea is you may not want to place the idea of having what you want when you want it that is not trusting in timing that is demanding that a reality must come in a particular way a very rigidizing process which very much and very many times is the reason for it being pushed further ahead that concentration therefore relax allow your timing to become apparent allow yourself to recognize when something doesn't come when you want it that it is your perfect creation of your timing and remember again this idea you get if you will allow yourself to create this reality anything you want simply not always when you feel within the limited spectrum of your focus that you must have but every time every time in valuably you will find when it comes it is far more shall we say perfect meaning that it would have been when you wanted it you will not be disappointed one other idea about timing that you open the things that you feel you do want now you are not shall we say ready for in the way you create processes in needing to be ready and have certain background for these ideas so simply recognize if it is not coming there are certain things that will happen prior as you create time that will enable you to enjoy that thing you want most fully that will enable you to have that thing that you want and be perfectly prepared to enjoy it most fully even if you cannot picture this now it is so and simply impatience or the idea of impatience is not living in the now is not focusing on the fact that the now is bringing you what you want now that you realize and again this is key that you deserve anything you want prior to that notion you held many things away from yourself because you did not feel you deserve this you now know better and you can trust in your timing because you do deserve it and it will come if you allow it do not block it's coming or push away it's coming to a later date by insisting it must come now what is available to you now is what is perfect to be available to you now look at that that is why it is there that is trusting in your timing trusting in your creatorhood as you have created yourself to have levels recognize and realize on some level you do know what you're doing therefore we in appreciation for allowing us to drink from the crucible of your consciousness all that you are allowing us to share and blend our ideas with your ideas which create a third entity a third idea for more shall we say synergistic than either separate idea the whole being more than the sum's all of the parts is an expression in your society I ask you now how may I be of service to you within perfect timing shedding a alright what are going to do thank you very much recognize there is the idea of parallel and alternate reality there are many ideas between the parallels of waking reality dream reality as you put it but one of the ideas that individuals do do not that your dog shall live forever shall we say but allow yourself as you become more aware of your self empowerment and that it is not always necessary to experience negativity though you may be aware of it you will work out many times within your dream reality ideas so that they are real but then wake up and not have to shall we say live out the consequences of them so if you do have what you label a bad dream simply realize you have chosen to work it out there whereas in your past you may have worked it out here and draw as you say I am really it is really quite a relief vow in that sense when you do relate to your sleeping dream reality in that way that often again though you are allowed to participate in realities in your dream sleeping dream reality that you have not linearly set up because this is much more or rigid your waking dream is much more rigid in the linear sense in the way you create it and it allows you to skip a few steps shall we say experience a few ideas and then whether appropriate in perfect timing only when it will serve you the most bring it back to this waking dream does that help? In a sense generally it means that you are bringing back one moment that you are bringing back a judgment of something that may or may not have happened but again simply an opportunity to realize that no bad mood can get the best of you you are creating your mood in every given moment and you are perpetuating what you label bad moods and you can wake up stretch out your and drop it move on you are that powerful in your creation of your reality what you label a bad mood that gets the best of you is simply you buying into the idea that anything could get the best of you which from our perspective it only can if you allow it so simply you can we find this quite helpful within the way you create your reality take a deep breath allow yourself to visualize in any way breathing out whatever tension you have created and maybe if you wish sigh what do you will find the idea of a sigh as a very aligning idea you will notice you can then start again from the zero rest point and then choose how you will create your mood an opportunity to experience this idea let the Mouth=== Is that something that occurs to... I have an interaction with her, or is that something that she's just gone for her? In a sense, it may be that a portion of your consciousness that is not within your conscious awareness was contributing to ideas. She was working out, but we suggest that it is just that. Ideas that she is working out, and it would benefit her most greatly to look at it from her perspective, not yours. In other words, you did nothing to her, nor have you ever done anything to her, simply how she has chosen to interpret your interactions. Therefore again, we suggest she may be angry in a sense with herself, using the portion represented in our consciousness by you as a focus. Point her in this direction, and what we are saying may become most apparent. All right. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Sure. Good day. As you do. Good day, I mean. All right. In my normal waking reality, the most meaningful things that I do is relate to other people. Okay? And they are involved, but in that relationship, my knowing that they are there relating to me in whatever is happening is what's meaningful to me. Okay? Now. All right. Can you say so? Okay. In my imagination or in my dreaming at night, I don't have that. I don't know. Let's say I'm imagining something, and let's say it's very pleasant, but they're not there. It's only in my mind. How long do I imagine that? What makes you say that? And have you heard? We have just said. Yes, but I'm still. You are relegating your sleeping dream reality to and recognize the double whammy, as you say in your society, just your imagination. Well, I can be awake. Invaledating both in one shot, shall we say? Yeah. That's what I'm doing. You do not have to. That's what I'm asking you the question. Okay? Here I am in my imagination. I'm awake, but I'm imagining something. Okay? I'm in a dream reality, either one, but as far as I know, as far as I'm concerned, that other person I'm imagining is not there, and I'm not getting the full pleasure of the normal relationship that I just referred to. All right. But recognize that you shall and are able to, and that is what we need by creating, focusing yourself in a most material way that that seems most ghost-like. As you develop, validating what you get within those realities that it has made a difference. And then act, here's the key, like it has made a difference, you will see from those other individuals that it has. For you acting that way rather than the other way, will draw a different result from them, therefore, experientially and this reality making it just as real an effect, do you understand? Well, let me see if I understand. Let's say I want something to happen in a relationship with a certain person. All right. And I imagine in my imagination I see it happening. That is what I want to have happen. Are you telling me that will increase the chances that will happen in my normal waking reality? If you act the way you act is in your imagination. Recognize what you are saying is you are creating a reality within your imagination. But and you are becoming that vibration at that moment simply that you are not continuing to choose to keep creating that reality out here which would have your actions be different as it was in your imagination. To come back and you say, oh, that was just my imagination and then going act the old way. That is why you get the old result by validating it in your mind as it has happened. You will now act as though it has happened. The other person will be dealing with you acting as though it has happened a different action and you will get a different result from them. Remember, you can never change any one. And when you do change yourself, it will seem that all around you have changed. Have you not witnessed this idea? Yes, what you just said is helpful to me. Thank you very much. Now validate it and use it. Move with it. Act that way. It is not simply imagining that changes the reality. It is using it as a tool to act that way. That changes this reality. As you begin to do that more and more, as you begin to validate in action those realities, you will find an interesting thing to occur. They will blend. It will become one reality, all three. And at some point shall we say you will be able to actually, actually imagine this and have the results immediately. But you are creating the separation. Again, act as though it has happened, then it will have seemed to have happened in this reality. Say, I wish that that was true and wishing implies you think that to be most unlikely that you need a gene of medical to make it come true, you will get that older reality. It is all your perspective. In my imagination reality, do you agree that the person I am imagining a relationship with, none of their consciousness is not there in that imagination reality. Do you agree? No. We do not. Okay. But at first you play a game called Make, Believe. Now listen to your language. Make, Believe. Once you do, make yourself believe in a sense, you actually allow it. It is not really a making. You will experience it that way. However, you tend to move in gradations. So then for it first just bring it down to imagining in a sense that it has happened. Acting as though it has happened and you will see the difference in the way the individual in that instance relates back to you for you are relating to them differently. You use that tool to change your attitude. Do you understand? This is very key. We suggest listening to this idea again if necessary. You are very close to being able to utilize it at an experiential way. It sounds very powerful to me and I want to have that tool. Thank you. Thank you very much and remember you want to have that tool. You get what you want. You are not always when you think you want it. Again, trust in the timing. All right. Very good. Thank you very much. Yes, thank you. Very nice for it. Re-fold. I am having a battery problem with the camera. I want to be sure I get everything. All right. Thank you. Again, I recognize you. All right. Thank you. I recognize you are. Let me go with her. Shelly. Shelly. Shelly. Shelly. Shelly. Shelly. I had a very good time. I had a very exciting day today. Yes, you have. You have had quite an exciting period within the last 24 hours shall we say, Prosy? And I know that you like to play games. I've been playing games today which I like to say. All right. The show are worth games. Very good. I'd like to play games as you would if you'll play with me. Prosy. Always willing to play. During the course of your dialogue some words that you spell out phonetically make the lead actually technology. I find myself dissecting words and looking for the multiple meanings during the course of the day. Very good. You have created your language with that complexity and it is no accident. One of the words, another word that you said when I was ex-nautilus and I thought this was very interesting. It's like feeling off the old skin and going forward to the new skin the way that I could see it. Very good. Another word, self-centred. In certain damn same reality, this was thought of as a negative trait for so much self-centred. That is true. And a misconception. When you started your dialogue you were talking about centering yourself. I thought that maybe there were other words that struck me but I think self-centred is the word that I would like to give you for 10 years of interpretation. Recognize within your reality a tendency as a cause. A tendency that one must, I believe, shall we say that one must sacrifice the self in order to help others and this is not and never will be our perspective. Therefore when one does shall we say center themselves it has taken on the meaning of being negative. Being what you have labeled also egotistical which is a little different of an idea. Up again being self-centred centering yourself from our perspective is very positive for you can only give outwardly in as much as you can give yourself inwardly. You can only unconditionally love others and as much as you can unconditionally love yourself. You can only demonstrate and aid others to center themselves if you yourself are centered. So again it is not that you must remain for perpetuating idiosyncrasies in your language. You may be the first shall we say to introduce self-centredness as a positive concept. Thank you very much for pointing that idea out. It is very violent. May I stretch your point. Please stretch your way. Okay self-left. Self-left which is you know someone who is self-left is third answer reality. So I should be a very giving loving person however there seems to be some paradox in the language. Again much of the same idea we have just discussed. The denial of the self. And again that is shall we say a mechanism that has been rather purposefully used to allow individuals to give away their power. Now you are in the age of taking back. They all power and these meanings, these terms will take on new significance. That is when I proceed to Rochester giving away your power and lastly you would indulge me Trevor and I had a conversation and I cracked some disappointments and I would like the someone saying he seems to be heretraffiancyanimology of the word. and a molly of words. All right. Can you define the specifics that you are disappointed about? I was just in general disappointed that I didn't get to spend more time with him on a personal level. All right. But you do not have to look at it that way. Again, trust in your timing. You do appoint yourself with full power. But when you place an expectation that you then is not fulfilled because expectations of itself is not trusting in timing, you did appoint yourself with an power in a sense yourself. Thank you. It's been very enlightening. I think I'll continue this. I don't know if I've got a term for Michelle working. Thank you very much. You didn't like me on this one. Yeah. I think so. Michelle, can I ask you a question? Yes, please. I'm Rosie. That's the Middle East. Yeah. I've been watching on today's television here in the US. The Senate and the House of Representatives discussed on the Middle East. And it appears there's a whole lot of issues coming up about this. And this situation, you could have looked at it from a positive viewpoint as presenting to us and allowing us to look at the issues we would not be looking at otherwise. Very cool. Now, some of those, I think, are to do with, do we want more? We want peace. There's probably the prime one. But I think there are many others. I might have liked your viewpoint. And what's the issues that you see that President Sweden see? Well, primarily and relevant to our discussions is simply the idea that you are your government. And as you see reflections of many viewpoints within your government, you can now recognize you would only be able to perceive them all if you contain them all and you do. As you do, allow yourself the opportunity to decide your preference and validate it, validate that which you do not prefer, you will begin to manifest only that which you do prefer and begin to see our external validation or matchings of that manifestation. And you are seeing that most strongly for the way that this situation is playing itself out. Shall we say it's far more integrated than in your past. Far more encouraging than in your past. Because of the way you are planning in a sense that linked itself up with the new technology, the new communication, you are having the opportunity to accelerate through this and witness, in a sense, the portions of your own consciousness externally. You understand? Yes. Does that help? Yes, it does. I was hoping you might give us maybe a little bit more insight perhaps some of the solutions they sort of made, three possible solutions. One being that the math is particularly technically using sanctions which is sort of forcing them to an agreement and certainly war, at least one being more negative than the war. Very good. Our idea from our perspective would be diplomatic. However, again, your society does move in gradations and it has, for the last 25,000 years, created negativity. So it may be that you do choose that middle ground. In a sense, though, it is still very encouraging for the idea that you are moving away from the far right extreme of negativity. Therefore, again, we have no preference in how it plays out. It can only tell you what we would do, but it is your world. Therefore, contribute from your conscious center and you will find that diplomacy is actually possible. It is a distant other means that there hasn't been much tried and that was discussed today and there doesn't seem to be any ideas represented other than maybe a couple of feelings while they did it in Geneva, which failed rather than in Italy. In a sense, on the larger scale, we refrain. Again, it is your world, but on an individual scale, do not, shall we say, underestimate what you are doing by self-empowering yourself and allowing other individuals to see this idea, by spreading the ideas that you don't get war by hating war, but by loving peace. You are, one at a time, turning over, clicking over each consciousness within the mass consciousness. That is the greatest service you can do, and that is the only place in a sense that you can function from. But again, recognize you are your governments. Determine your viewpoint and communicate with your officials. Do not make the separation. Equalize them with you. Communicate your ideas. It is not, shall we say, unless you create it that way and it's fit in the bucket. It is the way to transform your entire reality. It is coming from you, and you are, in a sense, doing this. Again, though, on the overall picture level, we've refrained. It is your world. Things are playing out quite nicely, and that is integrative money. Well, that means sufficient. Yes, I'll say that way also. All right. Do not mean to disappoint you in a sense, but do not expect that we in a sense will solve these ideas. It is not our place simply to appreciate and validate any path you choose. But, since you asked, we do perceive a more positive resolution than you might imagine at this time. It is up to you. I have another question on a simple level. Another channel, Robbers of Hero channels, an expert called Zush, has shared many ideas about our origins. And one of the things he says is that we're nicknamed, and they're equalously applicable to limitations, but he says that these societies are nicknamed the problem-soms. All right. They said for the lead one that we, in our world, have inherited all the unresolved problems of the universe. And now we are, perhaps, the only last, for the end of this cycle, he maintains that we have probably solved 95% of those, and other worlds are already getting benefit from those. And at this stage, we are just finishing off the world. So we're the last to best of this, both the problems and one of the main ones being the problem is constant, and one of the clarity, probably the negative. And then it looks pretty much like that's what we're solving now with the middle-ish situation. That is who, then you may view it that way. Ince the deathly, you may find it interesting, although we have not mentioned it in quite some time as you count and create time. We have also, from time to time, referred to your civilization as the shell people. But as we have begun, in the sense to interact with you, you have peeled away like your onion layers of the shell, and are now beginning to expose yourself to all that you are. Very exciting. And enabling us more and more to communicate clearly, more clearly, on what you would label, higher levels. Well, as you do break down that shell, colloquial shell, you are opening yourself up to the ecstasy that you are created from. Is that another question? Yes, just a bit of mind while I'm on it. A technical one. Oh, right. I've been listening to your face through the overlankers, trending for some time now, and your personal frequency and vibration, and the three products of that in various ways. The definition of frequency is something which I like the similar explanation on. As I understand, for every scene, I have a good technical background. There is something you can see on the telescope where perhaps you might put a sound as if this is the impossible frequency, or interacting and defining with each other. It's not just one single frequency, you see the torque and it has a single frequency. But how would you see an object, perhaps if it is built on a telescope, a metal sphere like you told for that, that we experienced? Thank you very much. Understand this idea. You are still using that device making a two-dimensional measurement. Stiff with that, as you develop what you label within your society, holographic technology, holograms, that you will recognize that what you have labeled, a sine wave also has depth. So what you may use as a visual aid is the idea of a spiral. If you turn a spiral on its side, you see a sine wave. If you allow yourself to be privy to the next dimension, if you will, and depth, if you will, you will have the idea of more, a spiral. It's a bit more complicated than that. That device will only measure always a very small portion of what we mean by vibration, but play around with our idea for a bit. Maybe you will be the one to invent that device, although we do detect it is around. I can see that you might just maybe expand on that. I was experimenting with finding out the difference between one, an object in one location and then another location and find the difference between the two. And there is going to be one difference in that existing location, which will be inside of the frequency now. Not exactly one moment. Recognize that what you have labeled two separate things, we view as one. And in a sense, though, we may not have shared this because of the general overview of the audiences that we do interact with. It is more than just location, time space, location being space, time space corn. Therefore again, a bit more complicated than just that. Yes, of course. There is a bit of time over the difference. What would we expect to see in differences in other words, the object itself, I should imagine, would then have the same frequency regardless of which location, time would do. But it would be a difference in time and the location. What sort of things should we look for in a different story? Not to skirt the issue, but your technology is not at the point. Two, at this point, view just that aspect however you can bypass the idea of technology altogether. Simply by using your consciousness, the isolation field of which we speak can also be created just as effectively by your consciousness with whatever symbol you choose to use. A gray misdiness for gray is a very neutral isolating, in a sense, color in the way that it absorbs light. And then rather than worrying about numbers, three frequencies allow the emotional aspect to be the mechanism, the activating mechanism. Therefore again, it would go something like this. When you do imagine or think of a place, it brings with it a feeling that can be used to, again, globally speaking, teleport by creating the isolation field, rounding about you, through your consciousness, and visualizing the place you wish to go and the key being incorporating how it allows you to feel. The visualizing will set up the new vibration, the emotion will activate the mechanism. Therefore, to be more reachable to you at this time, you may wish that tact. You understand? I do. The fact that I was sitting on experts. Could I maybe get you into a large amount of this one now? In fact, I've experimented with that idea. And it's the thing I'm not quite sure about is how much would you take when you do how much would you continue to include. I was laying on the bed and feeling what I had there and I'd execute things with me. And it was the idea of, okay, what do I isolate from where? That is up to you. Simply encompass that which you wish to take, feel locally speaking, for you, go nowhere. You actually just simply make up residence immediately at the new location, but simply enclosed within the isolation field we have described anything you wish to bring. All those details in a sense are skipped using that process, but recognize that there's another issue at hand. And that is again how much do you believe such a thing is possible? And do you really desire at this timing to do so in the, shall we say, effect that it might have that you have labeled in your past consequences? The consequences, shall we say, socially and so forth, that you would be dealing with. Therefore, look at the whole issue of your readiness to do so. Many people feel they are ready with and then do not look at certain issues about why they are not. Do you understand? Yes, I do, but that's not an issue with maybe anything. Alright. Anybody? What I think is the more of it is that am I going to arrive at the right place at the right time? Alright. But again, that is a fear that you might not. Yes. Therefore allowing for that possibility to be most likely. Look at that. What would a person, for instance, have to believe you have that fear? You nail down that belief. You recognize you no longer need to believe that, that it's converse, that it's opposite is just as true. State the new belief. In view the new belief with emotion, with conviction, with boldness. And how about I start? Alright. It is that simple and that is again another issue. Do you believe it is that simple? I do. If you do not, examine what you would have to believe to not. Is that simple? Okay. Well, something else I was offered as a subject and we used the lay lines of the earth to like a computer. So I could actually travel through one of those objects. Is that all the words that arrive? Is that a bad idea? No, there is no such thing from our perspective as a bad idea. Maybe a bit more convoluted than the direct route we have suggested. Then you do incorporate the idea of needing maps, needing directions, making sure you take the right line. But you may. It is a very valid way as individuals do do that. It's a bad way. It's civilized and attracted. I've been using 15 weeks in Australia for first. I've been attracted to something out there. There is an energy center that is an avenue called the Mount Taeckmont, which was very much meant to be. I had a connection, a feeling, a connection to Mount Baecka here in the north west of this country. And it was rather, I think, simplistic that I sort of went up there recently and I feel like I'm still making this connection. Very good. But whether it is not. Then very possibly you have established when you do begin to do this your initial departure place and over my whole place. Very good. Can I also ask another question? In a sense, again, one moment, not to interrupt. Nothing is an interruption. But you may find that you will believe it is more likely, if you do, isolate yourself when beginning to do this. Or you have less to be concerned about if there are, shall we say, other individuals present. You understand? Yes, I'll say that again, please. By isolating yourself, going to an isolated place, you may feel it more likely than doing it in front of or around other individuals. So you will not, in a sense, buy into there in validation. Yes. So, proceed. All right. The other thing, I challenge an energy, which I think is a pressure of the association regarding the energy. All right. One moment. Do not have to say. I think it's from. Well. It is. Proceed. Okay. It was to do with the energy limits between Australia and New Zealand and the North America. And the information I got for this, I'll be making those connections in a triangular fashion. As you have already begun, it is. I've already connected those series. And I was told it would be a form, a relief belt for the planet, an energy relief. In a sense, by creating this idea, you are setting up an energy gate, a door, way, which you may use for whatever you wish. If you feel relief is necessary, it may be used as a valve in that manner. The idea of the triad being the positive and the negative polarity and the balance between them, a very supportive structure. That is all we have at this time. Thank you. Thank you very much. There's some deals here we go. Thank you very much. Shady. Good job. As do you. Good. I was going back to the Trevor's. I think it was earlier, earlier question, where we were discussing the global concerns. Now, it struck me, you're saying to communicate with the government that they are you. I don't know. I thought I had it formulated. It's a whole thing. It goes on. On an individual level, there's a microcosmic thing going on, a macrocosmic thing, but going on, I think we're dealing with the same thing. It is one situation. Yeah. And it's like in our daily lives, as we're communicating with the government saying, I could perp. Then in our individual relationships, pointing and saying, you know, this person is the cause of my upset. It's like a microcosmic thing, like, oh, you saying or the arrows or whatever, whatever. And you're cutting the car on. That's what you're saying, that the one major impact that we can have in the mountains is really looking at where we're living our lives and asking out our lives. You're going to see a macrocosmic reflection. Yes. This is the idea of the situation is actually the reflection of all of our individual and group thought. One hundred percent now. And this is why changing your individual perspective changes the whole reality, not just abortion. Yeah, and being your universe, you know, in my universe, when I am, you know, being, allowing and unconditionally loving, that's how my universe is. And that's how I'm going to show up. When I am, you know, being at the effect and saying that someone else is surprised by a visitor in my world is pretty much a servo. All right. You may wish at this time with the timing of what is playing out and not thinking of that. Yes. Yes. I'm more and more like cutting that timeframe down on what they do that. I do recognize that I do do it. And that's my idea of the contribution to planet is every time I alter that play. Very good. I'm understanding no one certain term. So is each and every individual present. And it does make a difference. It does translate into what you label your mass consciousness. Is that all? That's very good. You are playing around very nicely with these ideas continue to play. If you lighten it up from working out of to playing with it, you can have a very good time transforming your planet. And it does not have to feel, laborious, cumbersome, effortful. All right. Thank you very much. Shady. For sure. Yeah. All right. Which everyone always does. I seem to only be able to focus on one subject, one item, one issue at the time. That is in a sense one of the ideas you are exploring being the masters of focus and limitation. Less so of limitation as you incorporate these ideas, but that is the idea of this degree of focus. The idea of third density, if you will, degree of focus. In fourth density would be different. In a sense, there is still some pointed next. There is still some ability to point, plus an experience in somewhat of a linear fashion, but that is one of the things that begins to diffuse. And you are able to begin, begin to experience the simultaneity. But when you do, shall we say, progress from beginning to the, shall we say, medium of that, you then become by conventional physical. So that idea continues into fifth density. Because I am sure as you recall, you seem to always recall anything. One moment. It is not that in every given moment we know everything, no, not by any means. We have always said, and you shall remember when you hear that we know what we need to know, when we need to know. It is still implying some degree of focus. You don't have to carry around all that baggage all the time. You simply have total 100% trust that in any given moment anything that needs to be there, not only information, individuals, circumstances, resources are present. I see. I had to ask you one time whether you would ever channel simultaneously more than one group and you had said yes, you had. Yes. Many had five individuals upon a given moment. Many had five in different groups and different situations or locations. Sometimes simultaneous. But shall we say very rarely the same thing at the same time, for there are always relative degrees of significance, that many portions of my consciousness shall we say, are in different individuals in a sense. So in Fort Density, which is where you are, you certainly can't deal with more than one subject at one time, which is my limitation, I guess. In a sense, but also I may perceive it as five separate interactions. And when it translates down to your reality, they happen simultaneously from your viewpoint. It depends on the type and depth of interaction. Okay. Can I switch to a different subject? Yes. You may. Switch you wide. I want to ask about a couple of questions about babies. Oh, right. A month ago, I was visiting my son and daughter in Atlanta and they showed me, first time ever experience to me, about a 10 minute video on their TV screen. What they call a sonogram. My daughter-in-law is expecting. She's pregnant. Oh, right. And there on the screen was a picture of the fetus within her body, roughly three and a half inches long. How did that allow you to feel? Well, I was amazed. I was in the law. I had never experienced that before. And as I was watching, there was continual motion. I could see the head. I could see the skull forming. I could see the legs. But there was constant activity of the fetus. Now, I remember one tape you had indicated that what we call the soul, let's say, normally comes into the baby, the body, at the time of her. Or maybe afterwards, but not generally before the whole physical birth. Thank you very much. We understand what you are getting at. Okay. That is the distinction to be made here. Thank you for allowing us the opportunity to us, Vals upon it. That is the idea of your, what you would say, mental consciousness. But that is also the idea we would label and you would label body consciousness. The body consciousness is present rather early on, shall we say. It is the personality, innocence, consciousness that is loosely connected while gestation is taking place, as you say. It is there but loosely connected. It is the body consciousness that you had witnessed. When, shall we say, the individual is born, that loose connection, for lack of a better terminology, tightens up. Still stays, in a sense, loose till three years of age but tightens up. And that is what we meant. I see. Well, as you probably are well aware, on this planet, we have a tremendous ongoing controversy between whether we are indeed killing a person. By abortion or not. And therefore I saw that previous statement of yours of when the soul, as the essence of our being, doesn't usually come into play until the time of birth. But again, is loosely connected. So you may recognize that when most scenarios occur, there are specific things being worked out. An individual may wish to experience only a small portion of physicality and not wish to, shall we say, allow it and have it come to fruition. And then there are a whole range of reasons that this would be so. As many in the sense that there are circumstances of that nature. Pressing. Okay, well, when a woman chooses to have an abortion of her fetus, if you will, I assume from that previous tape I had listened to of yours, that well, maybe we're really not wiping out a new being before they even have a chance to be born. It is a matter of terminology, shall we say it is an issue that allows you to explore many things and leave it at times. I see. May we make a suggestion? Yes. To this individual who is expecting, you may wish to delineate the difference between expectation and expectancy. Okay. Just a joke. Yes. Just to complete this subject, do other civilizations have this same experience and issue to deal with? In a sense, some do. Some do. Not our society. For today. For we are in conscious agreement with the entity from, as you say, the word go. In a sense, the entity, as a point of interest, in a sense, takes place, participates with what you label, in a sense, the, in a sense, sexual act itself. I see. This is very much fun. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Shitting. Yeah. Very interesting lecture I went to in the open in these rooms, right over there. A group of children. Now, he's a scientist who's been experimenting with what we make in mass consciousness. He. He calls it morphical resonance. Madeleine. And he's been experimenting with animals, flies, and even minerals. And he's found that there's definitely a connection between all these things within their own realm. And he's found that birds, for instance, can learn as a group. And once that group learns something, in another group, in another location, will learn that same thing very much. Madeleine. Similar to what we have just discussed with individuals as they turn over, in a sense, contributing to the momentum of any idea within a mass consciousness. Yes. And it's very high as much as 20% faster learning from one group to the next. Madeleine. So, much higher, shall we say, amongst human beings? Yes. Very interesting. Anyway, this brings me on to another question of what he was going on to from there was to find that they did some experiments to see where memory was located. And they discovered that memory was not located in the brain. Very good. They took certain portions of the brain, they had a monkey, some things, and they were able to find all the portions in different times. And it wasn't located in any one portion. So, that sort of brings us to mind then, okay, if it's not in the brain, where is it? And the idea I have is that it's perhaps located in the, what we might say in the world's spirit or the electromagnetic field, as we've thought it's... Shall we say, that is the conduit when you are manifesting in this way, but it is the conduit for the idea of your higher self. That is the emanating, shall we say, for lack of a better term point. But when you become physical in this way, you use that electromagnetic fluid in a sense as a conduit. So, very good. Well, I thought it's... what he's suggesting and I sort of... I could relate to it very well, is that we are, for our brain's perhaps, more receivers and transmittors. Shall we say, maybe more appropriately, filters? Okay. The same as your sensors? Yes. Not the windows, the filters. Not allowing in, most of reality, filtering out 99.9% of all reality. Same thing with your brain. Otherwise, and you may imagine that this is so, it gets quite confusing with your chosen pointed focus. You understand? Yes, it's quite what we're treating you by, really. It's a filter that's... because everything is present. What you're saying is you feel bad everything you don't want, so you allow it to put you to one. Now, in your society, you do create an idea of anxiety in that you take responsibility for having to remember things. And, in a sense, by putting an effort into this idea, you shut down the efficiency of the filter. Relax. You also know what you need to know when you need to know it. It's just that you have not validated that yet. Not necessarily you, in particular, but that is one of the ideas your race is exploring. Transforming from... From... Percy? I was trying to look at the mechanism on how we do this, because it sort of answers some of the questions where you get the identical twins. Yeah, they sort of can relate to the same sort of thing, just like you've got the same......to in a receiver that will fill better those, it's like for them. So they can receive the same sort of frequencies. It's not so easy. I would give it a good sign. Yeah, and the reason for the identical nets, as we have discussed, is they are counterpart. Personality, same, higher self. We seem to experience through an identical, if you will, conduit, different ideas and experiences simultaneously within the time frame. So therefore, again, the similarity of the filtration is due to the fact that it is from the same oversoil. All right. Is that on the VidCon to ask? Yeah, well, I'm not so thrilled for getting off course a little bit. All right. I was thinking, what I was trying to get at is okay now, as we move into portensity, are we expanding that filter? So they didn't want to know, in other words, when we need to know things, we know the way we need to know them all. That's what we're going into. Therefore, we don't need to carry around all the excess memory as we do in our necessity. But how do we do that now to the density we see in our own personal memories? Whereas what you're saying in portensity is not quite the taste. Simply, again, the recognition that each moment is anew, the past is not resulting in the present. That alone, it is that simple. That notion is the notion that walks you, in a sense, you're locking yourself into that idea. You are espousing upon. And when you do begin to realize the present is not a result of the past, your memory, as you now speak of memory, in a sense, disappears. You lose your memory, yes? So simply concentrate upon how often you do believe your present is a result of the past and begin to unlock that concept. You understand? Yes, yes, sir. That is one of the key differences between third and fourth density, between memory and knowing what you need to know when you need to know it. If you set up the present is a result of the past, you won't allow yourself access through your filters to things that you have not learned. You understand. When you remove that causal relationship, you remove that barrier to the filtration. So the difference I think is in the transition is going to be one idea to the other. If you say so, it does not have to be. It can be as simple as making the statement and acting that way. Period. Are you willing to allow it to be that simple? Well, I started to do something that has been up on the words. I said we had words in the same position, and you're talking. I said we can't find the word that you want. Very good. Find another word. For you do not need to know that at that point. Trust in it in that direction also. Do you understand? Within order of communication. From time to time. A sentence shall we say has been interrupted. Similar to what you are saying. The information simply was not there. We did not panic and go into upset. Simply realize, oh well. You must not need to know that. What do I see? That must be what I do need to know. That is trust in timing. Therefore again, there is some better way to express what you are trying in a sense, what you are saying. All right? Yeah, okay. I'll find out that. I'm just running out of that. I'm not certainly not knowing the right word. It was knowing that there is a word there which was described as if you want to want to express. And they're not being able to find a word of the state. It allows you to explore other options. If you fixate that you aren't forgetting it and only insist that that word must come. You generally lose the concept. You've seen that effect. Now allow yourself to experience the effect of choosing alternate ways to describe an idea. And you will find very surprising things will happen. In terms of drawing your stream of focus toward a new idea that will serve more of a partner. It is trust. I've got family office and sometimes when I've had something recorded and they might feel something like that. Not the word I tried. I prefer to use. I would have had to express that better by using these words. All right? But at that time that was the perfect expression. You are now allowing yourself for the next time, colloquially speaking, to expound, to change, to give yourself a system of feedback. Does that help? Yes, thank you. Thank you very much. Shady. I was very much interested by this question on memory because I do have read somewhere, although I don't recall where, but I have different brain processes that can be measured by the electroactivity in the brain. You can visibly see it except you cannot figure out where the memory is stored, where that actually takes place. Very good. What happens in a situation where an individual goes through trauma, you know, trauma, and they have no path memory but they are aware of what's happening in the present. Simply realignment, albeit through a traumatic source, a sudden and total realignment of the filter we are discussing. Okay. In the example of older... Your scientists will have trouble making these measurements, for they do not follow physiological pathways. I'm just trying to make a correlation between different examples that I could think of, often passing like that. How are I? Don't panic. You know, an older person, they can be able to recall this event early on in their life with great detail, but they have a hard time in the present, which would be the reciprocal of the other things in the late days. So how does that correlate? Very often those scenarios are set up as an individual has a lack of trust that they do know what they need to know, when they need to know it, and they begin to perpetuate a spiraling downward, if you will, of a certain idea. For instance, an individual forgets something, doesn't continue along the lines of a certain clause. They have a choice. Find an old part of this, turn it in as we have discussed, or get into a mode of thinking, my goodness, what is wrong with me. That is what perpetuates that problem. Then your medical society labels it, according to a particular characteristic as a disease. It is not, it is as any other disease stemming from consciousness, from labeling. If you say over and over again, this must be wrong with me, that must be wrong with me, you will manifest the effects of that idea. And that is all that is. So it has nothing to do with neurotransmitters or any kind of... You may then, afterwards, create that effect, but it first starts with consciousness and invalidating what you get. So people have a pre-belief that as you become older, you lose your faculty. Therefore it is a self-affirming mind. Very good, exactly. Could not have said it better myself. And it can start very often, very early in childhood. It is one of the things that becomes ingrained within you in your society. Do not have to look at it that way anymore. And it is that simple. And individuals, if they were willing to begin to see this, could miraculously be cured. Depending upon how much they have bought in and how much they feel that it is that simple to buy into an alternate idea. Again, individuals lock themselves into that scenario. But as of yet, as they often do, your health organization tends to look at the chemical idea as the cause. They are not. They are the effect. And they can change when you change the cause. That is why some individuals have miraculous cures. They have allowed themselves to change the cause. You do not hear about it very often. But the disease you have labeled, familial, individuals have spontaneously cured themselves from. Specifically, you do not hear much about it. For the way you have structured your media, bad news is more news worthy. Teachers don't die. They just lose their faculty. Alright. Does that help? Yes, thank you. Thank you very much. Then it will be bought a few shaddings remaining within this interaction. Shaddings. For sure. D'Mellum. They have originally heard of a drug called a chemical. I am not sure what it is. I have one that now has a DMSO. Can you do you know anything about that? Because you could care for that study. I know that not at this time, for a particular reason. There are things within these, shall we say, memory of the physiological channel that do need to be looked at before we are able to have the languaging to communicate that idea. Alright. Do not lose track of it. And it will be commented upon at some time in what you label the ordinary in the future. And thank you for trusting that we are conveying what we need to convey when we need to combine. Thank you very much, Ma'am. For sure. Yes. Trevor's visit this week has been very exciting. Yes. For a number of reasons, but I am focusing on his sharing with us that it looks like somebody has invented a way to, at the indicated Monday night, separate the hydrogen and the oxygen from the water and then use that as a source of energy with all kind of wonderful benefits. My question is, I think you have referenced the possibility of exploiting or extracting the energy somehow from the electromagnetic field of the Earth. Is there any elaboration or clues or anything further you could say about that? At this time, we will only present a small portion of the idea that one of the ways to distort that electric magnetic field is through the ideal you label rotational mass spin. When you do begin to experiment with the idea of spin and measure the effects, you will begin to have a new understanding of some of the idiosyncrasies of magnetic flow, a place to start in order to begin a new technology upon your planet would be the study of the directions of flow of electromagnetism around your planet. This is available within your literature. Seek it out. If it excites you, you will find it. When you do establish the idea of patterns of flow and are able to, in a sense, present that we will go further with this idea. Well, of course, one of the first things you learn about electric motors is that if a conductor, if you will, experiences a passing by or moving electromagnetic magnetic field, then current is generated. Very good. Now, plug in the idea of what we have just said, establishing the direction of the electromagnetic flow of the Earth and the other planet and cross those corners. So you're saying the electromagnetic field of the Earth is actually moving and flowing? In a sense. And offers us maybe an opportunity. Okay. There are ideas to be viewed. I see. Use your literature. Make use of the physicality you have created. We will share as your understanding increases, so we do not hand it over to you, but are able to, in a sense, share with those discoveries. You're getting that. Sounds like a potential of energy with no pollution generated. Very good. Thank you. And inexhaustible in supply. Thank you very much. Share it. Sure. Yes. I could just speak of magnetite in reference to orientation or reference of direction. Yes. It is located within what you would ladle your sinus cavities and in a sense, enables you. And it's the mechanism through which you have your sense of spatial orientation. It is what your animals use that you label, honing, mechanism. Because it is, in a sense, magnetically sensitive. It does enable one to orient themselves in comparison to the electromagnetic field that we have just spoken of. Okay. I'm not sure what that thing, then, this idea is, but the point has a bad sense of direction and how can it select that? I'm about to give you very much. Yes. The idea is similar to an idea we have just spoken of. Very often, most often, when an individual has a bad sense of direction, it is perpetuated in their consciousness simply again using externalized events, or I have gotten lost, for instance, as evidence to perpetuate that you have a bad sense of direction. By simply stating that you have a good sense of direction, feeling that this is so, recognizing it is that easy to change, ably, you realign in a sense your relationship to this mechanism, and it is, that simple. How about when you're alive trusting that where you're alive is in the second way you can be? That is another idea, but that she has been speaking of. But in a sense, it is trust. I heard you say, that's a bad sense of direction with the negative use of language. Exactly. In the way we have just described, it is that sensitive to your thoughts and your attitudes. I have a good sense of direction. Say it, say it with boldness, say it with conviction, feel it, and that emotion, that energy motion will activate it, realign it, and you will be able to use it in a positive way, and it is that simple that responds in that way. Very often you look for the complex mechanism and it is simply consciousness, simply attitude, simply positive or negative application of trust. Can I just kind of give you a lecture on my identity? It is electromagnetically sensitive. We will leave it at that. Also, this is coming to light within your scientific community. Therefore, again, if it excites you, seek it out within your literature. See that it already exists upon your planet. All right. Thank you very much. Okay. Sir, I'm just like, you know, what's the dynamic weight of the scientific? That is not at this present timing within the memory of the physiological channel, but again, do your research and it is available. All right. Thank you. Thank you very much. Sir, the physiological channel has to know anything to have it come out of you. No? From time to time. Do it, do it. Essentially, again, a matter of trust. As his trust does increase, we can access, in a sense, we can use his filters in a different way. But there are innocent doors that are open and shut to us by his trust. We are imparting much more information that may be what he considers to be beyond his normal recognition as these interactions progress. And, in a sense, have from time to time imparted things that he does not know. Again, simply a matter of trust, simply a matter of timing. So the most appropriate answer is sometimes yes, sometimes now. But always wear exactly perfect. From our perspective, for that is our only experience. From your regards to vocabulary? He does not have to be consciously aware of, shall we say, the meaning of particular words, but shall we say he has been exposed to them. We generally do not come up with words in a sense that he has never heard ever. That is why we are not able, in a sense, to speak different languages through him. He is not programmed in a sense in that way. And that is why we then communicate with other individuals around your planet who are programmed in various languages. All right? Thank you. At this timing, we wish again to express to you our unconditional love and appreciation for your willingness to continue to recreate your reality according to preference, according to unconditional love and according to trust of your timing. You are beginning to trust your timing. In previous two hours, speaking to you of it this evening of your time, simply allowed yourself to gain momentum, to serve, to ride on the waves we tossed to you. And you will have a good time. That is the whole idea. Growing, expanding into more of yourself in ecstasy, having fun without, without struggle. It is the new focus of your transformation. You have lived out limitation. You are now living out in a very real sense in no uncertain terms, transforming from limitation. You are, shall we say, somewhere in the middle, very good place to be, predistined from both ends, a fulcrum point, representative of a new type of balance. Simply again, your trust in timing, your trust that you are perfect creators will allow you to progress along these lines. I bid you a most fond and loving. Good day.
