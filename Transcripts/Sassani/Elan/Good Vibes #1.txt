 How are you all the seeking of your time as you create time to exist? Thank you very much. We begin. This interaction, this evening of your time with the entitlement, if you wish, goodbyes. The idea being we are spoken many times. The distinguishing feature that allows you to make distinctions, what allows objects, events, personalities to have separates, is different in vibration frequency. You may have to wish you or look at God or all that is as the primary vibration of existence. Therefore, the prophet by which all that is, differentiates itself so to seek. It still remains one homogenous substance but seems to differentiate is by attenuating, changing, distorting, frequency, vibration. You understand even within your science, in your society. The idea that you only do perceive a small bandwidth of the overall frequency of creation. You do understand that you are able to make the distinction between what you label different cues of light from varying degrees of difference in the vibration. Your slower vibrating, if you will, longer wavelength, form of visible light being red, the color red. And the higher shall we say frequency, shorter wavelength of light being violet. The idea again being that, what allows you to draw the distinction between your different colors, your red, your orange, your blue. Yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet is the idea of their varying frequency, varying vibration, if you will. You also in that sense when measuring vibration upon your planet are measuring but a minute portion, a small again bandwidth of the overall totality of the vibration of creation. For electromagnetic frequencies also occupy a near shall we say, slice of the entire spectrum. And your measuring devices at least up till now have been in general electromagnetic in nature. And therefore your measuring of the frequencies is quite limited, quite in that sense confined to but a minute portion of the overall idea of vibration which we speak. You each and every one of you are a particular vibration, a particular frequency. We choose to label that portion of your vibration that colloquially seeking remains the same, allowing you cognizance of your identity to be called your signature vibration. Therefore as you grow, as you do with different lines, as you expand, you do have still some sense of being the same identity because that vibration, that signature vibration remains constant in a sense. And that is again what distinguishes you as an individual. For each and every different individual has a different vibration, a different frequency. A shall we say transcendental vibration is what you label love, unconditional love. For what that is in a sense is a very loose vibration that can easily be tuned to any other vibration. You are willing that to accept and appreciate any aspect of creation. Your willingness to unconditionally love it, so to speak, is in that sense your way to harmonically resonate or attune to the vibration of the thing being loved. Therefore, when you in that sense do express unconditional love, you are being, shall we say, empathic, sympathetic, not meaning feel sorry for it, to the idea you are loving. And therefore you may consider that unconditional love is a transcendental attuning vibration. Rather than your society, a thing to know them is to love them. We wish now in that way to propose to you that to love them is to know them. For that allows you to attune your frequency literally to the frequency of the idea being loved. And therefore you will always find in any given situation your willingness to approach that situation with unconditional love, acceptance and openness will attune you to the specifics in that situation and gear your perceptions toward finding the most positive outcome to any given situation. This also applies to other individuals. For willingness in that sense to love them first will then allow you to see the things about them that do attract you, that have been the reasons you have attracted them. You do not attract in that sense anything to you specifically for a negative outcome. All situations are fundamentally neutral blank. You assign the meaning and therefore if you approach it with negativity I assure you you will get a negative effect. But if you approach it with unconditional love you attune yourself to that situation. You allow yourself to vibrate sympathetically with that vibration and that changes your perception. That allows you to look at the situation through new eyes unconditionally loving eyes. Those eyes will be very creative eyes and they will allow you in that sense to always be positive in any given neutral situation. You have in that sense in your society and we do not mean this derogatorily become masters in a neutral situation at gleaming the negative. You are very good at this. It is in that way something which you have become quite accustomed to. However it is by no means a law of creation in its simply an approach, a habit when you are not aware you are doing it. But you always have the choice for when you are aware that you are doing something you label a habit you no longer have the habit it is then a choice. And therefore by simply understanding that you have perpetuated the willingness to label things negative you have created the negative effect from that label from attuning your vibration to the negative side of the neutral situation. Again all neutral situations contain equal potentiality for negative and positive. It may seem because of your habits to be a bit more obvious what is negative in given situation but now again you can allow yourself to be a bit more creative and allow yourself to glean the positive reasons for any creation. When you do the ones that are negative will transform. When you begin to own and use all your creations in a positive way you will no longer create a reality that needs to be relabeled that seems on the surface to be miserable. You will in that sense transform that whole symbol out of your life. And it is that simple. Again your willingness to unconditionally love will enable you to see in any individual good vibes. You understand very literally in your society when you speak about getting good vibes from a particular individual it is this alignment of vibration of which we speak. You are truly exercising your sense of vibrational discernment which is an electromagnetic sense that you have and are sensing in that way their vibration. If you sense that their vibration does not mesh with yours in that way in general you give it a negative label that person is very bad I do not like that. When in that way it is synchronized with who you are then you get good vibes. However understand again everything is vibration. Vibration also includes belief systems. Your primary belief is but an idea. Ideas and thoughts are also vibration. I will be in a bit more a theory from your point of view. Therefore you can always recognize that your beliefs are vibrations. Now recognize you can only experience a reality that you are the vibration of. You only attract even though you have the same opposite attract. In fact you only truly attract something to you which is of life vibration to that which you are exploring. The vibrations of your belief systems act very literally as filters. But when you will operate with a particular for instance limiting belief you will only allow yourself to see through the vibration of that belief and therefore will only be looking for shall we say evidence that that belief is true and that will in that way lock out your vision of 99.9% of the other options around you. When you begin to nail down your limiting beliefs those vibrations which carry along with them other beliefs of life vibration you begin to transform your reality as you say from the ground up. For the idea is once you begin to nail down the limiting beliefs you have choose to no longer perpetuate that. You state your new belief deal with all the emotion you can muster how truly having that new belief allows you to feel and then and here is the most important manifest of vibration in this particular reality act as though you are a person who already believes that you will with that action be the vibration of that person. What shall we say determines your most outwardly visible vibration to others will never be your beliefs or your thoughts sometimes may be your notion but what is most visible in your reality both between others and yourself and all that is in yourself are your actions. Actions are the ultimate manifest of your vibration when you act as though you believe something this deep louder as you say than words. So therefore you can recognize that the beliefs the vibrations that you contain now that are limiting that you do not prefer the only reason you still experience them is because you act as though you believe it even if it is something which does not serve you in any way. It's simple recognition can now allow you to recognize that when you formulate the new belief and act that way you are not pretending you are not fooling yourself into believing something you are simply taking the same mechanism that you already use with the old belief unconsciously and applying it to the new belief consciously this allows you to now be a conscious creator of your reality and not an unconscious life. Again unconsciously creating your reality has the result of seeming as though that reality is happening to you you are within it you are trapped. Keeping your reality consciously allows you experientially emotionally to see that your entire reality happens from you even like it does. Therefore if you will begin to allow yourself in any given moment to tune into the good mind you will find it no matter what. If it is one of shall we say the most or more typically labels negative incidences in your society on your planet that still does not make it inherently bad. If you will see allow yourself to believe what that particular thing has allowed you to do that you would not have done without it that can always be a place to begin to believe positive meaning from any of your creations. You create your reality 100% all the time no matter what you believe. If you believe you do not you experience the effect of not creating your own reality but the paradoxes you are creating that therefore you are always created and you can always when you decide at your own leisure nobody will rush you to have too much fun take back your creations in any given moment and it is that simple. Allow me now to thank you for in that way sharing your vibrations with us. We constantly marvel at the many expressive ways in which all that is chooses in that sense to experience itself to discover itself. We are enriched beyond measure to have the opportunity to interact with your society in these interactions although you are very focused in your chosen reality seems very solid that does not make you any less spiritual all physicality is an expression of spiritual reality so do not deny what you have chosen to experience. If you do you will not take advantage of what is right in front of you. You will constantly be denying that you have created it to begin with. If you will begin to appreciate that you have chosen it you will look at your life at your reality as though you have chosen it you will act that way then you will give yourself the opportunity to see why and this is what your society members of it are constantly saying to us they wish to know it is always right there if you will be but willing to be an owner a conscious owner of the reality that you already flawlessly create perfectly do you create this reality and we thank you again for your willingness to be of the vibration now within the transformational age upon your planet where we can find you for this was not always so different were our vibrations we also can only experience the reality we are the vibration of so to us the mere fact that we can interact with you means you are of life vibration you contain the same potentiality within you with which we live in our daily lives and we thank you for your willingness in this way to interact with us in this level as an equal I ask you now how may I be of service to you sharing the show as you speak a little bit about the energy gateway that you spoke of our last interaction and why will it close me here why doesn't it just stay open in a sense we are simply observing cycles of particular energy and the wise and where force are in that way your societal emotions we simply identify the energy shall we say opportunities or gate and the particular one of which we speak is from most literally since your 1987 year to your 1992 year but they are also overlapping shall we say other energy gates the one of which we see that will last for the next six to twelve of your month is one of the most conducive gates that we at this time are able to identify to begin to create all the reality consciousness it is a very conducive energy atmosphere with which you can begin to explore inside within yourself and manifest the changes you decide within your 1992 year to some degree we have in that sense identified that past the point of the closing colloquially is closely speaking of that game it will be a bit more difficult to get on that track however not impossible but the idea being that at that point it will almost be impossible to sustain a reality which is not reflective of who you are in other words denying your excitement denying the things that move you and doing things that have some sense self in post sense of obligations those types of actions will fall apart far more quickly there will be less of a conducive nest to be able to sustain a reality which is not indicative of who you are. I think so so the gate will be closed in a year only because that's the way the planet is going in this sense as we read the energy now and remember there is no such thing as a prediction of the future for the future and the path are always created from the present therefore any quote prediction is simply a sensing of the energy in the now moment of what is most likely and again the mere rendering of a prediction by changing individuals awareness of it they can then make the decision to not manifest that reality and the mere rendering of a prediction can't remember it absolutely so nothing is etched in that way in steel however this is what we are noticing most strongly right now however again there is a larger overall gate extending from your 1987 to your 2027 year and this entire gate will be representative of what we have called the transformation from third to fourth density upon your planet. Thank you for sharing. For sure. Yes. Last week you mentioned vortexes and in my house there is a ticker spot which I stumbled on to by coincidence where I meditate and there is a very aggressive power. You are allowing yourself to sense the ideas of which we see. Is that what you say is a vortex? Oh yeah. What we are sensing in this case is a very shall we say localized and you simply allowing yourself to tap into it it is a most conducive spot for your turning within. Can you share your experience of having in that sense have this recognition and absorb yourself in the minute. What is it allowed you to do? It is a pretty powerful feeling. I think in a sense it is showing me that my own personal power which I have given away it is more or less showing that this power is for me to take back in. Thank you. That is what I read. The good company is a tendency upon your plan however so will be the taking back of your power and we thank you for your willingness to simply just do it. I must have another question. Oh. I was wondering though it seems like so often that pain is in accompaniment to spiritual growth. Not necessarily. In general it shall we say the product of the judgment that remain as you are expanding and in no way shape or form actually a product of the spiritual expansion of the growth. But go on. But it just seems to be a necessary component of how can you let go of pain to still grow spiritually. The idea is again you grow spiritually you will. Pain in that way is not a product of that growth. It is a product of any shall we say remaining resistance to that growth. Any remaining judgment that where you are is somehow better than where you have come from. They are both equal. Any idea that unequalizes ideas produces friction. Creation will produce pain. There is also the idea of viewing yourself as a whole being one whole entire idea and like a election of parts when an assent individuals break themselves down into body parts they in that sense can cut off shall we say the energy of the whole. And sometimes experience that this allowance of flow of energy as a do either of these things to apply or is there something more specific of what you think. They do it. What will you then do? But trust you not resist change. How will it not have a fearful attitude towards it. Do not need an access to trust for the idea is revisting change in a sense is a making a force of allowing change. Allowance takes no effort. Do not need to trust simply let go let it happen. Life works if you let it. And again change is the only constant. You cannot force something to change however you can force something to seem to stay the same. So if you are experiencing something which seems to stay the same light enough let you know and in that sense allow your access to flow it is inerrige within you always potentially flowing. You actually stop it and you can stop stopping. Does it help? Yes it does. And we find you. Thank you. Shri. That's right. I heard that we have somewhere else in the world there is someone else who looks like us. But you offer me a social. It is. Do I have someone who looks like you somewhere? One moment. We can see that you do. What is your question? I was just curious that is true if there really is someone else who takes physical form that looks like me. Shall we say it is not true with everyone putting certain customers which may be a bit higher than you might expect. That does not mean in any way shape or form however that other than physically they resemble it. In general it will be an entirely different explanation so therefore in seeing them down your street you would see the resemblance. However in action since a person's looks in that sense are somewhat determined by their attitude their actions the way they hold and carry themselves you will in generally find that in action there is not so much of a reason. I have another question for you. What happens to the soul of an individual who is a bad person for instance. There are people on this earth that are murderers, are serial killers, are just too hard of a thing. What is the purpose of the experience that people are. The following I do. When you die what you experience is what you believe in that moment you are experiencing. For then you are a thought for today world of thought energies and there is no corresponding time between the conception of an idea and its immediate manifestation. Therefore from what I have just said you can now extrapolate that the idea upon you upon you is able to walk, walk, and calm up is self imposed. What this means is it is not in that sense an empiric truth of reality. It is a choice when you heavily buy into karma then you will in that sense experience a tit for tat upon tat for that is the strongest belief that you have. Very often again in your society individuals are strongly ingrained or allow themselves to be strongly ingrained with what you label heaven hell synanios. Therefore if they believe that that is what will occur that is what they will seem to exist. Very often individuals who do what you label bad have within them some sense of morality. And when they do the bad they are not judged from God or all that is all that is is unconditionally loving non-judgmental that is a human quality judgment. However they will judge themselves if in fact they buy ancient karma or a belief system that judging themselves by their own standards would send them to hell then they will expand it. However from our perspective the idea of eternal damnation does not so much exist. For again you are a thought for in a world a sea of energy thought ways. Therefore you may create initially a hell scenario but after playing that out for some period of time and time is quite valuable on that other side in general you will have a thought of something else when they do it transforms immediately. If they believe in that sense that they are trapped in that hell they can prolong that sense of seeming being trapped. There are as many experiences of soul shall we say face loosely speaking as there are souls. Each and every one of you is a discrete individual because that how many different ways there are and there is not one way. If there were there would only be one person obviously I assume there was not. So the idea being that in general it is what they most strongly buy it and then the specifics will vary depending on what that is. This is why in general individuals on this particular claim of existence to perform things that they judge by their own standards to be bad will in some way shape or form punish themselves. Again even by imposing a hell scenario or what you label reincarnated using the law of karma that if they killed someone they must now be killed and in fact then will create that reality. But that makes sense. Yes, thank you. Absolutely. Thank you very much. Chilly. For sure. Thank you. Hello. I'm trying to understand the difference between the beliefs that I create and what the laws of physical reality are. Oh, what? I was very surprised to hear you on a tape to judge somebody that she not have milk because they're talking to you and it would help her with her sinus problem and I've been thinking lately that that was the belief system. It was in which that individual had strongly wanted to. So in that one particular scenario and incidentally that did not occur through this channel. It was another. But the idea being that was what was most conducive for that individual. Again, because there are so many different beliefs in your reality any given conversation may have many meanings for many individuals. We however thank you in that way for noticing and asking. So how do I go about changing my beliefs? I used to have the same beliefs about caring. All right? I said we do that. So did the channel before you. Okay. So now if I decide that whatever I eat will have the effect that I wanted to have. Can I protect you? See my reality. If you again believe in. Remember is of course that for changing any belief is to own the belief that you have. Admit that you have it. Even if it is not a belief you prefer to have. You cannot change it so you will first at least say all right, all right, all right. I have this belief. Then at least you only where you are at and give yourself the opportunity to change it. Then when you state the new belief and act as if, understand how such a person would act if in this Indian you did used to believe that upon the drinking of your milk. You would expect a particular physiological effect. If you are now a person who did not believe that what would you do if the physiological effect came along. I will shorten the process and simply suggest that you would not label it to be from that cause. You would look at it differently. You would not let anything be evident that your new belief was not so. And therefore realizing the physiological effect could not possibly be from the milk. For that is no longer my belief you will begin to look at some of the other shall we say meanings for that signal. All right. Then the general question still stands. What is basic physical reality? What is the law? It is very valuable. The idea being that there are general agreed upon principles. Any individual can be free at any time to bury a from the, however, the individuals who have agreed rigidly with experience will no longer see that person. Whether they physically move or whether when they are doing those things they are just not physically around the other people. And they will never in that sense be able to prove what they are saying to the individuals who chose not to experience them. So therefore they best answer to your question. It will be quite an individual exploration for your math exploration have had certain agreements. You may find that there are other individuals willing to bury it from that particular agreement and those will be the ones you will share with those scenarios. Does that make sense? I think so. Is that a story? Yes. How many times do you think? I think so. I think so. It is a question to have you. It is a wonder to watch this. I am listening to some of the tapes but it is really a little bit like going into the garden and having a past day to go over here. One screen is up over there by itself. You are truly a remarkable poet. And for us just as beautiful as the plot is to be over and we thank you. Thank you for your opportunity to participate in the rest of your energy. Thank you for being for you always, O'injut. I did have a question for you. And you are still? I do. If I understand you correctly, this is a party of mine in many ways as it were. You function at least in a positive sense as a representative of the association of work. That is true. As well as a representative from my own history society. And also, listening to you speaking as one from the old citizen of the world. That is good. I look in the yellow pages under association of the world and then all I got was to take the torch and have to seek the dots. That is something I have. It is a question that I have. It deals with some of the negativity that has surrounded some of the activities of our particularly in friends. Reference some of the methods used in the investigation and accumulation of genetic information. I understand the need to be left alone. I am not in total sympathy with all of the methods. Can you be a bit more specific for those who are doing it? Well, popular culture, not only do you have what has happened as in some sense, we are going to get a popular culture through the idea of UFO production. And then some of the activity is up to kind of hunger. What has concern in these is the violation of innocence and crime during the manipulation of really powerful green crime. In what way? Well, there has been, for some of those adopted, there has been the erasure of memory of this being the inability of a conscious personality to retrieve memories of the events involved. From our perspective, the idea is simply that the memory in that way has a certain timing, mechanism, upon it, and it is loosely speaking, time released as and when necessary, to continue for that person to be what it is they chose to be without getting to distract it. Does this make sense? Are you talking in terms of the conscious personality or rather the memories of which you speak and are in that way, expressing our erakes on, in fact, simply, masks, and the individuals willing now to begin to look at the fact that they choose their entire reality if they will also realize that by definition, and also means they then might have chosen that particular reality, they then will begin to, as we had said earlier, vibrate at a rate to begin to view it through new arms. And then the timing of the releasing of those erased memories will accelerate. However, it is never forced upon the conscious recognition of an individual, particularly if they are still in what you might loosely label the denial of stage. Anybody who interacts with any of these societies physically has only done so by agreement. However, that may be quite an unconscious agreement. The moment you consciously decide, I must have agreed that it is a conscious agreement and changes the way an individual will proceed that reality. Are we getting so much? I understand what you're saying. I will accept the reality, the dressing degree, or let's say... Again, though, it can be unconscious once you simply recognize that as a monster, they have agreed. Nothing is forced upon you. If you understand your creative reality, 100%, nothing can slip in there and get you... One of the previous questions I would do with a moment of concern with their negativity of some of the people around it perhaps, seriously. And we can say that there is always somebody out there who is willing to buy into your own negativity and help you support you in an assessment, perhaps. In other words, what we perceive you are saying is the exploration of victimhood perpetrators. Exactly right now. In these interactions, however, that is not the exploration. On what, in that way, the individual, the human portion, shall we say, chooses to feel victimhood. That is actually. Once they choose to feel that they are no longer looking for the positive reasons that they have created that agreement and are simply in the denial moment. But that is inshless. We know this may seem a bit coarse, a bit indifferent. However, it firmly has you back your power so from our perspective, it is quite an attached point of view. Okay. All that I was saying is that on the surface, from a common sense point of view, the use of force to abduct someone without their not just permission, by definition, can not be in this. Not a manifestation show of the same understanding as well. We understand that there is that of attitude. But in this sense, we have. When individuals upon your planet, in that way, come in and grab someone with ill-meaning intentions, what you are saying applies. However, there are no ill-meaning intentions from the end of the data's population. Therefore, since they are not choosing to explore perpetratorhood, it will always be the choice of maybe just a few minutes. Over there. I'm trying to start a business to help people find jobs. And I think that following my excitement, I would like to do it. You may not need to try however you think. And those are the decisions that go on. Okay. Well, I've been socialized to fear the future. Please other people and basically not follow my question. Oh, very good. Thank you very much. Think about how much time you have just saved yourself by only those who have been going on. Well, those police are leading to procrastination. And I'm wondering how I can just stop. You are acting as a person who has those beliefs quite obviously. Therefore, you change them and act like the person who has been in the beliefs. That person will not have procrastination in their arsenal. But it seems that if I spent 33 years of my life... Then you are at the perfect pinnacle procrastination. And you may now have another 33 or 66 if you wish doing that which you prefer by being willing to validate who you truly are and not accepting any social invalidation. Or when individuals invalidate you, you do not in that sense feel it until you buy into their invalidations. When will you do what you have saved? I'd love to do it right now. Go right now. In this aspect of it. We have almost recently just to do it. Thanks for doing it. No, there is a trial ever simply. I didn't do this thing, but go on. Okay, well I've been socialized to fear the future. Please other people and basically not follow my statement. Oh, very good. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. You just saved yourself by owning those beliefs. You can go on. Well, those beliefs are leading to procrastination. And I'm wondering how I can just stop. So, there are four, change them and act like a person who has been in voice. That person will not have procrastination in their arsenal. But it seems that if I spent 33 years of my life, then you are at the perfect pinnacle for transformation. And you may now have another 33 or 66 of you wish doing that which you prefer. By being willing to validate who you truly are and not accepting any social invalidation. Or when individuals invalidate you, you delight in that sense, kill it, kill you by into their invalidation. When will you do what you have said? Alright, I'd love to do it right now. Go right in. In fact, it is. We have the most recent readjust to do it. Okay. How about is that all? For now. You start the else to call the speaker. So, at all? I should. The gift that you want. Please, go. Sure. Hello. And to me, it's good. And I'm going to talk about the discussion. I have a friend by the name of Helen in the given area. We will be at one of our interactions soon. Helen is a doctorate. On a fairly routine basis. And she feels that she is given the justice of their labor health care. And we feel that she is even part of the whole team. So she is very much integrated into the whole process. And she feels that where there is a lot of fear expressed in certifor. This is kind of in front of the engage rules who are simply not fully aware of the fact that they have a degree to interactions and so forth. So, that's a very very different point. Oh, right. And if that is the example, doesn't mean for the take of these interactions, we will speak with them. Is there something else? You don't just want to make a dilemma. Oh, thank you very much for your willingness to make it bold, sacred. Or you do not have to ask a question. A question is simply taking information you already know and putting it in a code one where you can receive our validation. How do you ever form, however, that when someone gives you the correct answer, how do you know it's right, unless you are ready to contain it? Therefore, as you will begin to make a statement of who you are, you will be sharing with us at equals. This is what will allow us to interact with you, shall we say, face to face, rather than this format. However, within this time, we insist in that way, not only for a mass invitation, but that when that invitation is issued, that your society recognizes its equality to us. We are all equal. All. There is nothing, as he has said, any better about spirituality than physicality. There is nothing better about being more expanded than life expanded. They are different explanations of reality. They are as valid as each other in terms of ways that all that is expresses itself, discovers itself, and continues to create more reality. And we thank you very much. Okay. First of all, I want to share about art, especially in that last week, I was able to, and for giving to this year more, here, I was able to communicate, practice through some of that litigation that I was putting on myself and was blocking with the slide. And for the person who had the wisdom, physical manifestation, that's left, that doesn't have any of the moments, that's the answer. And in that sense, that is how accelerated one can transform it on reality. That's simply, you did nothing physically, simply changed some attitudes, and a physical thing immediately reconciled. It is that simple. This is how you create that to begin with. Let me simply. Let's go on. Well, that part of it was your school board. But, um... Oh, what? I'm so confusing some of my people who are in any self to that. And the confusing is coming in, I don't know if I can explain it well. You were doing your phone. Thank you. The idea was that I was holding back on my feelings and found a business and wasn't expressing myself and was doing it out about patience. So, once I explained it, that's what I was doing. That hand was wrapped in self-communicating about it and took the imagination of the numbness away, however, out of that experience I found, I felt much lighter and I felt a little bit about myself. And now I'm confused as to what direction I'm supposed to go on, because the positives and the so-called negatives seem to be balanced. And I don't know whether I'm... How that will be quite simple. What is it? 20. 20. Oh, I'm... No, you don't want to say that. Then you are prepared, I'm sure. There are issues in the people there. And perhaps we will, however, and exchange means yourself. Okay. I can't... I still feel confused about the idea of whether I should do this in this new business. Oh, again. The question was not what does not affect me. I'm telling you, out of the framework of any particular discussion we are having, overall, what excites you the most in life? Helping? Oh. In my practice. Helping loves nothing else to feel, just... I guess, helping us to accept results or not an honest view that went south. Oh. and if you recognize in that way that your ability to do so, we'll always be directly proportional to your willingness to love and help yourself. Therefore, if you truly love yourself, you will grant yourself what excites you with integrity. For there is no accident that a particular idea excites you, particularly. That is your particular indication of what it is that is most you. If you can have a life of doing what you do not prefer or you can have a life of doing what you do. In order to have a life of doing what you do, you need to identify what you do prefer. Because you are excited about it, because you prefer it, it is most effortless a thing for you to do. So therefore, again, before you can act upon your excitement, you must establish what it is. And in that sense, it is no big process. You already know. Simply in your society you are taught to invalidate the things that excite you. Because of specific society, overtones. Oh, everyone knows you can't do that. Everyone does not know. What excites you. That is your accident. You may have to go around. Do not have a way to make it a burning, subtle process. This is quite simple. If we relax, center yourself. Do not have to do it now. It's brought to the people. But the idea of being in it will be quite obvious. And when you are proceeding in action, remember the distinction between the most exciting thing you will ever do. And every single moment from what's available during what excites you. If we ask ourselves, does it excite me? No. All right. I won't do that. Does this excite me? No. I won't do that. Does it excite me? Oh, yes. Does that excite me? Oh, yes. Which one excites me more? Oh, this one. Do it. That is how simple your reality can be with the fruits of acting that way. It begins to get the same momentum that the fruits of invalidating yourself as now. Most all that are experiencing reality that they do not prefer are actually experiencing fruits of a type of belief they have born into. Now you can take, shall we say, the bitter fruits and prefer the sweet of them. Does that at least give you some place to proceed from this? All right. And we highly in that way will appreciate feeling about your experiences along these lines. Or we can guarantee you that to the degree that you validate your excitement and act upon it will be the degree that your life will change according to your presence. And the vestiges of old things that you are buying into out of a self-imposed sense of obligation will simply begin to transform and disappear. Being replaced by the new things and the things that excite you when you will be willing to act upon them will always bring whatever abundance is necessary for you to continue to do that exciting thing. Let us now take one last distinction. When acting upon your moments to moments, excite me, do not get hooked on any particular expected resource. For excitement takes many forms, one excitement leads to an act. And they are all related though they seem unrelated. If you will simply do these exciting things without expecting that they must have a particular outcome, you will not narrow down your focus to that only one outcome and be able to see so many outcomes that happen from it. Doing what excites you may not always have the exact effect that that particular thing would seem to have, but it will always lead to another opportunity that they have nothing to do with the first exciting thing. So it is simply a matter of taking the trust that you already have in reality you don't refer, you are very good at trusting and placing it in a reality that you do not accept anything as evidence that it is not working. All right. Thank you. Jim. Pleasure not. Jim. Missy, don't mean. I have two questions about myself. I seem to experience a very weird experience. I am not afraid of planes at all. I am not afraid of getting on them or traveling on them. But when a plane does go over, I am very aware of it and I very often get a sad feeling. I don't know if I fully believe in reincarnation, but it is the only explanation that I have ever been able to come up with. It is something in another life of mine occurred on a plane that was something tragic that makes me feel sad. I feel that somebody is being taken away from me when I see a plane or you are playing it all over. Oh, that is all perception as well. That there was an individual in what you may label your immediate past life that cares too much about. That is all perception. Now again, we are not saying you need, believe anything we say. We do not insist that you do believe who we are that we say we are, anything that we say. Simply that if what we have to say works for you, use it. Beyond your belief. From our perspective, that is a recognition of that out of your know for us not you. And then from loss was for someone and all we are allowed to share is near and dear to you. I do remember all of this is nice information. You always have right now everything you need to proceed to do what it is you chose to do in that lifetime. And do not need other than a self-imposed need any information from the present or the past to continue to be who you are. Again though, that can be nice information you can enjoy but do not need it. No one, no one to. My grandmother passed away three years ago now and I often find when I am in a situation I find that I am either thinking about the way that she would handle it or thinking the way I think she would think. Oh, in that situation. I wanted to know if she is somehow. I mean as you might loosely label spirit God, not having in that sense made the decision to re-incarnate. But you have in that sense just nailed down the more precise mechanism. Not that you will hear her whispering in your ear. But certain things will remind you of her that is the gentle loving nudge from that end. It will always be very unobtrusive and therefore always seem to be like something that you will always give yourself the choice to say I made it up. This is happening. It is that subtle. There she is in my life in some way. Oh, yes. I know. Thank you. As you. At this time we will pause for a short break of 15 to 20 of your minutes and resume contact at that time. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. This is my premise. So the point is I believe and I conjecture that this happened to Jesus at a young age probably somewhere around age 11 or 12. Why do I strike that age simply because I feel that the kind of breakthrough that he made this tremendous awakening, this tremendous discovery of a relationship required the simple mind of a child. Very difficult for the more settled mind of a mature adult to accept that kind of dynamic. And he said himself, except he turned and becomes a little child. You shall have no wise enter the kingdom. In other words, it's not a matter of age, but it's a matter of a child's likeness. But I conjecture that it happened as a young lad sitting out on the hill like the psalmist many years before, looking at the clouds drifting by and wondering as did the psalmist, what is man, the dark mindful of him. And I believe that one day into the consciousness of this young lad, something happened. An idea dawned so great. We've all had ideas dawned in our consciousness. They're all relative, of course, but we've had those times when my God, Eureka, sometimes we don't last very long. Sometimes we have that happen to us as time and time again, but there are times in your life, certainly there have been times in my life when we've had that kind of a breakthrough. This was that kind of a breakthrough, but something far greater than perhaps anyone before or since has ever realized. The discovery of oneness. Now, Jesus made a great point. I am a father, are one. And we've tended to water that down by sort of envisioning Jesus' meaning that I stand close to God. He's by me and so forth. And oneness means being friends and having relationships. But one that means one, not two. I and the father are one. This was a realization that tended to break down all of the previous concepts of God out there, God in the heavens, God in the temple and so forth. God is someone you pray to and supplicate from. God is someone who forgives you and loves you and at other times punishes you. Your realization as the psalmist caught it, but never quite was able to hold it, be still and know that I am God. I am not. The problem that many folks have with us is it seems sacrilegious. How can I say that I am God? Well, if God is all and few of us will doubt that, then I am a part of that oneness, right? So if someone would say that you're made entirely of water, then it certainly would not be sacrilegious to say, be still and know that I am water. It doesn't mean that I'm all the water in the world, but I am water. I am God. God expressing as me. Not God around me, not God above me, not God that sometimes talks to me and sometimes turns his back on me, but to know that I am God. Manifesting himself as me. So in this discovery came the idea that the allness of the universe exists within me. You see, this is Jesus' awareness. The kingdom of God is not somewhere. He said that comes not with observation, but lo, the kingdom of God is within. And you are that kingdom potential expressing as you. Obviously, there was still some entomblement to do, there was still some piecing of this together, but this was the great breakthrough as I see it. I believe that one of the problems has been in the scriptures, in Christian teaching, in Christian tradition, is that we have been told that Jesus was divine. And this is the way the Bible has been presented. Jesus then was a worker of magics. He worked under special distendation. He stood astrived the world like a great colossus with the boats of the heavens in his hands, and he could do all things. He was a magic worker. And so we've tended to see him in that frame of reference, even though he himself debunked this, and we've overlooked these little instances where some man came and knelt down before him and said, good master, he said, why call us thou me good, not as good, save God? And when he said, all these things that I do, you can do too, if you have faith. These are very important clues that are normally overlooked, conveniently swept under the rug under Christian tradition that insists upon the divinity of Jesus. So we need, carefully, depending upon our background, our exposure to Christianity, or even if we have non-Christians and have rejected this kind of thing in Christianity, we need to get away from the tendency or the belief in the necessity of worshiping the man Jesus. Christian tradition, early along, made a god of Jesus, built monuments to him, great vast temples in memory of Jesus, and most of the services, especially the worship service, and very, the Easter worship service were memorials to Jesus. And so that Christians became trapped in a religion and a religious practice that had no withinness. It was all outwardisms. It was all come to church, go through the motions, do these things, partake of these rituals, and then go back again to your own way of life. As the poet sings, they're praising God on Sunday, they'll be all right on Monday, it's just a little habit they've acquired. So we need you to pick it up and lay it down, because it's all outwardisms, you see. The point is, we need to understand that Jesus was a dynamic figure in history, as well as in the unfoldment of God consciousness, a figure who was a great discoverer or a great explorer, a great questor on the great quest for truth, who made some breakthroughs that have enabled us, you and I, to understand ourselves. And this is what it's all about. Now there's an illustration that I've used in my book that I would like to kind of paint the picture of for you here today, because it's one that had great meaning to me. I don't claim any originality to it, I don't know where the idea first came, it may have come as a flash in consciousness, it may have been something borrowed somewhere, who knows. Anyway, this is the illustration of the window in the wall. And I see figuratively the whole thing is truly figurative, and you have to see this on the basis of trying to get away from the idea of up and down, in and out, and dimensions as we normally think of them. Jesus calling disciples to him to invite them to see with him through a great window, a picture window that he had created through the great breakthrough of his consciousness, that enabled one to see beyond appearances, beyond limits of his own mind. Beyond limitations, beyond the facts of the case, beyond the problems of relationships and of life and age and death and so forth, to see through all of this great wall of race consciousness, and to see through to the depths of truth, to the reality of God, to the infinity of the universe. So he gathered his disciples to him, and when the disciples at first wanted to sit at his feet and worship him, and followers later were interested only in holding his hand and touching his garment, he was forever saying, come and follow me and see as I see. Look as I look, know this truth as I know this truth, and the first the disciples didn't get the message. Few of them did until after the experience of the congruence of fiction and the resurrection. So that there was a great confusion about this. They all thought that Jesus was a great teacher, a great ruler. It's like the Eastern story of the pointer. The teacher uses a pointer to point to some great truth, and the average individual unable to understand esoteric things simply worships the pointer. And so Jesus became the pointer. And so we have worshiped the pointer, and we've sat at his feet and worship him, or he pointed out the window, we've tended to worship the window, so that for a while after Jesus had left this particular experience, some of the disciples caught the message and were getting people to come and see through the window of truth, the grandulae of the disciples left the picture, and the great charisma of all those who had been closely involved in this experience was no longer there. People still came and sat before the window, but they no longer looked through the window, they just looked at the window. And the window was not cared for, and anyone who keeps house knows you've got to occasionally wash the glass. The glass gets dirty, and in time it became opaque with dirt and grime. So there was no way to see through it. And so people through generations and generations simply came and sat and looked at the window and worshiped the window. And in times human consciousness being what it is, the window was adorned with jewels and gems, it became the altar of worship. And so through the ages, millions upon millions of people have come before that window and have simply worshiped the window. And only here and there through the ages has a great, clear thinking person taken the time to wipe away the dusty concepts, and as Emerson has said, look through the window and have a first hand and immediate experience with God. Now this is important because most of us have been exposed to the window. Few of us have been given the insight that the window is to see through. The implication of most that we have been taught has been that the whole purpose of religion is simply to worship the window. Continue on the other side of the state.
