 How are you all this evening of your time as you create time to exist? You have a very appropriate link and very creatively manifested for yourself a door way, a gateway, a passageway, a period of time which you have defined as extending from the 15th of March to your April 15th, that we have for you labeled activity month. We suggest that you do utilize this gateway as it is a conducive energy atmosphere for accelerating your ability to manifest the reality that you do prefer. We do realize that during this timing of your time, many of you are experiencing what you shall label a transition. This transition shall manifest itself in various forms depending on the individual. Many of you have taken this opportunity to discover. Many of you have taken this opportunity to shall we play with the idea of trust. We suggest to you that this doorway or gateway can be used in whatever way you choose to use it whether it be positive or negative. So we also suggest along with our other suggestion of utilizing the gateway that you may prefer to use it in a positive manner. If it has been that uphill this period of timing your life that it has not been your tendency to choose a positive reality, we suggest that you examine very carefully the other options available to you. The options are manifesting your reality in a positive way. Again as we have said this does not mean you will not have negative thoughts. This does not mean that things may not occur to your mentality which you may interpret as negativity. Simply that you do not when you experience this particular aspect of polarity that you label negativity that you attempt to push it away or get rid of it but simply integrate it into the wholeness and fullness of the full being that you are. Ultimately in keeping with the theme that we have been conveying to you the determinant factor that shall be what actually results in positive or negative manifestation is your ability and willingness to act in a positive manner. If what you consider to be negativity crosses your stream of consciousness simply do not act upon that perceived negativity for this gate is a very powerful gate and will just as quickly manifest that negativity as it will positive. So if you find yourself preoccupied with thoughts you consider to be negative thoughts that is alright. You can examine them. You can. Shall we say explore the ideas of these negative thoughts? Explore the way what belief systems you must still contain that are not serving you in terms of manifesting your preferences within your physical life. You can use the negativity in that way and that is integrating the negativity rather than manifesting it through action. When you are done these explorations these observations these periods of time which you are being very honest with yourself in what you might still believe in order to be experiencing these negative thoughts. However when you come to the step the action step the step that will be the accelerating step towards taking what are merely thoughts, energy and manifesting of eyes physical reality. It is at this stage and this point of the process in which it is essential that your action is reflected all the positive meanings that you have gleaned from these negative thoughts understand it is not a new concept to any one of you. Let everything that occurs every physical occurrence is a fundamentally neutral occurrence that is nothing new to you. I think at this point we can safely say you have born into that one to some degree what you are experiencing within your mentality as a negative thought is simply your label of that neutral occurrence in a way standing from your old perception that the present is a result of the past and therefore when a fundamentally neutral situation does occur that in your past was perceived as negative you then acting on this outdated belief system assume that this new fundamentally neutral situation must also be negative for that's the way it has always been in the past you can now see why we have shared with you the idea and reality that the present is not a result of the past. Each and every situation that does occur is a new situation even if many of the parameters are similar to the way in which you have encountered them in your past it is not exactly the same and therefore by definition not the same at all if you change but one seemingly minor aspect of any interaction is a completely new interaction if you perform an action and moments later perform what you perceive to be the exact same action understand it is not for the second time that you had performed that action you had already performed it a first time whereas the first time you had performed it you had not performed it at all so even though the motions may be similar by fundamental definition it is a new situation we cannot stress from our perspective the importance of allowing this concept to sink into your belief system however your belief system whether or not you have created it to seem whether this is so is a matter of your choice you choose what to believe by continuing to believe things which do not serve you it is your choice at that point to continue to manifest that idea we have shared with you the idea that changing a belief is as simple as wording the belief that you do prefer in your physical plane a nice touch sort of say is to up front up front it out loud with conviction although that is not that necessary it can be helpful but what will manifest your new belief system and the step in which many of you have shall we say not meaning Mr. now the quarterly fall in short of is the step of taking that belief that you now have a firm and do prefer and listen very closely acting as if it is already so acting as if it is already so there may be portions of you initially when starting to work with this principle that thinks oh well I'm just making it up I don't really believe that but an interesting thing will happen by succeeding in action as though you do believe that you will experience first time the idea that believing is seeing and not the other way around as you have believed in your own society we have reiterated to you several times on several occasions that we can't prove nothing to you but we have also always followed that idea up with the idea that you can prove to yourself these ideas that you can prove to yourself ideas but only through your action with altering your idea to the new ideas at the present is not a result of the past not only do you free yourself up to be able to see the positive ideas in any fundamentally neutral situation you also shall we say for lack of a bad terminology this mantle what has become your self imposed law of karma what we mean by this idea is as follows your whole screaming law of karma which presupposes that for every action you take you must experience exactly that action in order to achieve a balance this entire concept cannot exist if you understand in a fundamental way that the present is not a result of the past you are now existing upon your plan in this transformational time you still manifest the idea of forgetting your connectedness to all that is however the difference between this physical life and shall we say using your time like your past life any of the things within this lifetime that is that you fear you have already lived out in any of the past life in which you have had we shall revise this to say all of the fears that you have have been lived out in one life or another therefore even from a standpoint that the present is a result of the past you're all at ground zero and there is no need to put any energy behind fears that you have for you have already with them out and now you can look at them in a different light the different light of which we speak is looking at your fears as they occur as opportunities to point out to yourself portions of your belief system which are no longer serving you to help you to manifest the life you prefer so on perspective we may convey to you along with a suggestion is that from now on when you find yourself fearing that you get very excited about the idea instead of thinking oh something must be wrong I must be backsliding I am so afraid you can now say oh and opportunity for me has just come up to examine my belief system in a way where I shall be able to within this sitting weed out a belief that no longer serves me and replace it with a belief that I prefer all joy everything is a matter of perspective this is only a slight shift in perspective however what happens is a flight a mere shift in perspective results in a grand change in your physical reality the idea that you cannot perceive reality that you are not the vibration of is one that can be very comforting as you are rearranging your belief system for understand that as you do change these beliefs you can only attract a reflection of the new beliefs and these new beliefs as you replace them one by one in action are physically raising your vibration and aside note that we might make here at this point would be the idea that you do not have a signature vibration you do not possess a vibration you are a vibration you are your signature vibration that is why while feeling of your time we suggested to you that rather than try to picture the idea of a vibration simply allow yourself to get into your meditative state your state or place a perfect peace and feel or experience your vibration this will give you a much better idea of what this vibration is as well as allowing you to be more synchronized to it then your excitement will be more clear will be more surface present in terms of acting as your parameter toward action in accordance with your higher self purpose we also suggest that as a group you begin as you have not to use the parameters we have given you the idea of clear intention clear definition desire deservability and clear action it is in our civilization an automatic process that is not rigidized however on your planet you have created the idea of writing things down which is very helpful for you and what we are suggesting in some way shape or form is the idea of an eye-tenerary in order to do this you will have to make and leave an appropriate amount of timing either within this evening of your time or on a knob however all the acceleration that has been achieved by this group has been shall we say remaining within this group by performing actions that is the way to spread the manifestation of these ideas on output as well as be living examples of them yourself one moment we are closing a flight shall we say crack in our communication one moment thank you very much a return for your willingness to create this interaction with us to co-create all interactions within your physical experience and allow us to provide to you reflections from our perspective which differs greatly from yours but you have the ability to live your lives in much this manner that is why we are communicating to you in return for your unconditional love and willingness to co-create this with us I ask you now how may I be of service to you? does that mean if you desire to manifest abundance that you can just go out and buy things with that manifest that abundance even though it may not be in your hand yet? thank you very much one moment there is not so much that idea although that is one variation possibility of way to proceed it is more the idea that you put out your intention to be abundant not in the way that puts it off into the future but in the way that you realize that you are already abundant and then proceed in a manner utilizing what does excite you as a compass does that answer your question? well not exactly because one of the things that excites me is something I want to purchase and I am not abundant enough to purchase it so it is difficult to take action on the manifestation when that object is not available do you as you say was that the abundance to acquire this item and is it just a matter of feeling that there are all the obligations and not using that abundance to do what does excite you? or the abundance not present and do you need to go out and somehow attract it to you? I have to go out and attract the abundance somehow then simply be clear that your definition is to have such an item proceed with the trust that the things that excite you are directly leading you toward having that item and watch what happens and come back and tell us all about it does that answer the question? is there some clarification that can be given on this item? well I think if you could help also the channel Andrew is in seemingly a similar situation and he wants to know what is going on with his situation and why isn't the thing that he is manifesting and how that they have produced but the physiological child is in a very creative way exploring the idea that this time of trust although he does not have to do it this way he has chosen to allow the indications that there are reasons to have trust to be shown to him by shall we say walking on the edge we suggest that it is not necessary for him to do this and that simply that realization in and of itself the realization that he can simply trust and allow these things to manifest may be the perspective which will prove to him the idea of this trust one moment we are having some difficulty does that answer the question? I believe so thank you very much thank you very much thank you very much thank you very much thank you very much thank you very much thank you very much understand your call has been received now simply when the call is returned take the phone and act thank you very much thank you very much one more question that is as to the matter of negatives crossing the stream of consciousness there are times when negatives seem to come from an internal source you need an environment of poses and disturbance or a threat or a frustration there are other times in which one moment one moment defined internal source of negativity okay the internal source is a propensity within the individual because of his particular time track a propensity to feel or act in a certain way or propensity or a momentum a program that is utilizing the ideology that the past is resulting in the present yes okay proceed so it may be that we can you know I find that not so difficult to look at those items as they occur understanding that there there are programs within me because of my particular experience and there are propacities that I'm looking at those and reprogram but there are other cases in which the negatives that cross my stream of consciousness seem to come from external sources defined as say the Orion energy of which you have spoken on many occasions defined your own perception of the old line energy good question thank you very much I recently read a report by a retired naval air force or boat or no but no one who indicated that Orion entities were based in our southwest of the United States all right we understand we are familiar with that idea yes Cooper I think maybe a bit hysterical our perception is that he does let us say buy into the negativity of that idea yes prothy and looking at that phenomenon I find it rather interesting I wonder to what extent it is our own creation out of the belief that the nations of the world can come together only by confronting a common enemy as being meant for Mars all right that is the reality however one moment state your name Ted your full name Theodore Dana thank you Theodore Theodore Theodore Theodore one of the ideas of the word door may sometimes in your language be interpreted as back usually meaning in the sense of your back of your physical structure but we shall put these ideas together in different ways okay Theodore whole lifetime of back to God you can only experience the one moment the reality that you are the vibration of even if entities with negative intentions or shall we say in your presence if your vibration is one of our positivity and you do not draw negativity to you with a magnet of fear you will not perceive that even if their intentions towards you or shall we say harmful or negative it will not have that effect upon you no matter what if you do not vibrate that negative reality do you understand this concept I believe I understand that if you're at a certain frequency they can't touch you the frequency you're at if it's high enough and serve as kind of a refuge sanctuary escape that just door one of the ideas of our presence at this timing is for us to pose to you an alternative to that type of energy which will enable and allow you as an individual and as a society to reach you can't let negativity to positivity do you in some way shape or for fear this negative or lion idea no the fact is I'm more interested than fearful of it and I'm curious about that I think I myself was an Orion entity one time or in many past lifetimes one moment it is our perception that you are from a sea so I look upon these entities as beloved brothers with problems or with the quests and I find myself thinking are there alternatives to the way they are proceeding how can they be enlightened because they are all after all you know they too are facets of the all it is yes understand at this time within the Orion system there is much that we have labeled light that was not present shall we say years ago in that system that system is beginning at this timing to integrate their polarity of negativity and positivity and much of the resulting integration which is positive manifestation is now occurring upon that plane part of that integration from their perspective then involve certain individual shall we say reincarnating upon your planet in order to explore the ideas of polarity from a slightly different perspective but shall we say that it would probably be who you to be one of the individuals on this planet of light by providing a walking living example of negative integration and positive manifestation you will afford others the opportunity to do the same and you will transform and in effect create a parallel earth universe that does not even physically contain that idea you are allowing many individuals by being a living example of this to transform themselves on to shall we say this parallel existence thank you in the one related theme and that is that the key events to going there and doing that is the integration of the negative and whatever processes hence pointers that may be available in your world please share them with us thank you very much we have been all along the opening statements which we made do you contain much of the idea of how to accomplish this it is nothing that is new to you it just seems that in your reality you often create the idea that in order to changeably you must have it as you say hammered into you we look forward to the time when we do not have to reflect to you in this matter in this repetitive matter but in the meantime we shall serve that purpose we thank you for participating on your end in this exploration and again suggest that you proceed without fear if fears do come up explore as we mentioned earlier what police you must still be holding in order to be having that fear and move on does this answer your question sufficiently? yes it does thank you thank you very much Sherry you saw how did you choose or how did you and Andrew come through an agreement for him to be a channel for you at this point in time thank you very much this agreement will be elucidated on a little bit more in future interaction however for now we will say this between physical wise there was a reminder of agreements that have been made it becomes a bit sketchy to describe because of the imposition of the timeline the agreements were in a way made along a different stream of time and it becomes hard or difficult to correlate for you that idea but as any interaction of this nature it was by agreement having to do with manifestations of the incarnations of this being upon our planet as well as past reincarnations of not only Andrew but many of the members of this group we have said to you last interaction of your evening of your time that you could all pipe in to our stream of time this is also by agreement we have noticed that not many of you have taken us upon the offer law as a gem that you may wish you again we shall refuse your time unless they don't live a little bit more closely on our relations with Andrew and our relationship with that and a few other of the physical wise and it may give you a better oversight in two hours but at this particular time because of certain factors which we are thinking that you are not certain among relations on your part will take away and we do not want to spoil it for you does that answer the question? in addition to that when Andrew was at camp he had a sighting can you elucidate on that sighting of the station? again we do not need to be vague and from my understanding of Andrew's how we take him from it he won't like this answer but not at all the time because you are not certain the answer is much better we have Andrew you are good day that was not good I've come to the realization that you have reflected that because every day I feel more and more and more and more I was just like, it's my first time and I was a little bit tired of the results and I think it's cognition, which is my new experience everything is now a sudden and you are all from one thing to the next and it's like you have more multi-trivial to do because everything becomes a kind of doubt we said and I feel like all getting a bunch of joys I'm on my own more and more and more and more and more and more I'm not the only one who is good, it's like I love it it's like now I swear to God, I'm on my own I just wanted to share that with you thank you very much, we welcome you to the interaction sharing who they are, individual expression but you are creativity and science and people are like you are willing to take responsibility for what it is that you say for it we have said many times that when it is that you ask us questions you already can aim the answer and are allowing us to take the responsibility to reflect that back to you that is not a damn great idea of questions it allows us to share but anytime any of you have something to share please poke it, it won't be interrupted and then we also ask welcome to the fourth century yeah, sure I was wondering if you have music yes thank you we have music in our society it differs from your idea of music although there are some similarities presently. There are the communications that animal wishes to share with this group. And you are more than capable of allowing me to act as a conduit, or shall we say a middleman for these communications, and it may occur from time to time. But we perceive that if you will proceed with your dream and wow, animal to communicate through yourself, well shall we say we perceive, it will be a lot more fun. So dear, must he ask your own taste during these interactions, if you feel as though animal has something to say, please communicate. You have another question. No, thank you for this one. Are you sure you don't have another question? What can I do to accelerate my process? Process 4, what? Halfway. Many times we give this answer, we get a groan from your society, but it is the only way for us to convey to you how simple it is, and the answer is go right ahead. Do it, close your eyes, breathe, synchronize with your signature vibration, and allow the communication. Oh wow, that door which is being so firmly knocked upon, you open widely. You will be amazed at what steps through it. Thank you in return for your love and willingness and boldness to interact with us on this level, particularly when in your society many others would label you as insane. We appreciate the opportunity to allow our consciousness to blend with your consciousness for we benefit just as much from these interactions as you do. As we have said, third density is just as valuable, just as good as fourth density. There is no difference in quality in any manifestation. However, we provide for you reflection that it might just be possible to live a life of a static explosion of coincidence. Very soon, the echoes of your new belief systems will, for lack of fairness, terminology, catch up with you when the first individual in this group does begin to experience the maverick of everlasting ecstatic explosion of coincidence. Do not be jealous. Do not feel, oh, I'll never make it. It is only indicative of what you are capable of. It only shows you the wonder of what you also can do, or you would not be here in this interaction at this time. You all are equally capable. Although your strength and weaknesses, or shall we say, seeming weaknesses shall vary. You all are of equal empowerment. We desire to continue interacting with this nature with this group, or not only does it benefit our civilization of SSI, but it benefits the 368 society's or civilization in what we have called the association. And at this time, we send you our thankfulness and appreciation for your willingness to co-create and understand we would not be here without your portion of the co-creation, this interaction, this evening of your time, and all evening of your time. And we bid to you, a bond, and love it. Bye.
