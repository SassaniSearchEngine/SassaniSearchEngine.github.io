 The topic for the next interaction, the title, will be, ah, clarifying your vision. So maybe one of the things you will clarify are suggested topics beginning next. Therefore we will discuss the primary laying down of the vibratory foundation for proceeding in your reality, your vision. Allow me to proceed to exchange and allow this interaction to keep. Oh, enough on the last couple of topics, the subject of allowance, when you and I had a professional a little while ago, you would have a say, thank you though, as a truly sensational expression. Thank you, Mr. President. You and I were discussing this, can you just take a lethal faith? Well, the idea is that that representative action would then result in initiating a new cell I say. Well, I was, I immediately afterwards said you were referring to my living condition, because I said you would expand that into more. I did not only include that idea, but included that as well. So I expanded that into more of my business life and took that lethal faith. Of course, you know all this. Wisdom is freely profound. The changes, um, bagging a project that is enormous in this field, I'm very excited. You bagging, or what? Well, I think I have, um, my question is, everything is synchronously and I have committed myself to taking a vacation in the next two weeks. This is raising an enormous amount of terror within my client that I'm going to be gone and I'm going to be a part of the panel that I'm not as time that is involved. Oh, it's exciting. The shall I say opportunity for them to explore what they must be. And I decided that since this opportunity has arisen, therefore I must be capable of handling it and that I am not allowing myself to feel that terror and, uh, decided that I am capable and intended that this project will go quite smoothly. And congratulations, it absolutely will no matter what happens. I don't think they would start sharing their optimism. No, perhaps, perhaps for the time being, it will behoove you to simply mind your own. That's a nice thing. That is why I am still continuing to live in a new vision. Now, understand, at any time you can match their exploration, but much of that, you have already worked through to allow them to explore how the interaction affects them, but also shall I say remain grounded in your own effects and how your own lines are now being pushed further and further out. But what you are actually doing is increasing your ability to serve them often. So perhaps that reflection they may appreciate. They are quite terrified and I am trying to convince them that there is no reason to see so. Well, I will let that slide. A few nights ago, however, I had a very unusual dream that I think it would be unusual for me, perhaps not. It would be more unusual than dreams that you have already shared, perhaps not. Go do proceed. You know, it's possible. Yes, this one is actually a little warm on saying, it's just a hell-firing brimstone. I was walking around the mountain and basically, we sent it into what Dante would probably see, or that people a resur excessing of the ghetto. And what you nominations the people had something new life this season would prove to me. Yeah? connection when you're being sent in general you are exploring your ground system but need not interpret that as you have in what you call tellers. Well there is a lot of unpleasantries involved or I was at least from witness to a lot of unpleasantries and really didn't want to allow them to affect me. And if you find that to be honest. Yes. So you are aware of the negativity. Two is extreme degree without experience. And the transformational symptoms. I was quite surrounded by it and there were a lot of people who were quite upset around me and I might be answering my question but I was wondering how this might relate to the process that I'm undergoing. Is it specifically that I am basically wading into my fourth extreme representative me is wading into my client's fears. Well to some degree it represented taking responsibility for the reactant but it was also being willing to explore within yourself and understanding that you no longer contain the notion that something exists within you that can overcome you and again allowing you to have the opportunity to see that it is not your responsibility other than to reflect that to them in your actions to be responsible for them getting that idea and they will get it automatically. I'm sorry. I've gotten green Mr. Biden for quite a bit. Well you did a fine job in interpreting it in a usable way. Now again there are other interpretations as well which will more relate to directly your own exploration of your own ideas hidden ideas here's within and so forth but what we had discussed at the beginning of this interaction we're getting in touch with those fears and any idea you label negative experiencing them and through that experiencing allowing the emotion to deliver the belief will now come in hand. Well I think some of the other ramifications were my fear allowing myself to feel their fear and allowing myself to believe it. To some degree that this was going to be a problem that I was bitten off more than I can. But do understand that in no way and at no point did you feel that it is impossible. You created you max that fear within yourself and that is all you can ever see. So a reminder of that mechanism will allow you to recognize in that moment you are in a sense condoning the very thing within them then you have the opportunity to shift your point of view. Again if you act according to the new point of view you will be providing an alternative to them which is the greatest service that you can provide in the situation. A non-inclusive alternative living exactly. Yes and during our private session you said that I was going to be quite successful at doing that. Well the quality of but what you are exploring here is not so much your perception of their fear you are closing it in that but it is still the remaining here within yourself it's all wrong. Allow yourself to see. Allow yourself to experience and in your case you will find there is not so much. The fear that I'm not capable of doing this project but multiple things project. Okay. Does it not excite you to see yourself doing that carrying it off? Yes. So that is your prerequisite you have. Do you get this? Directly related to that is the subject of this upcoming vacation which you know is filled with an enormous amount of emotion. There are many there are so many things that I could focus my intentions on on a particular period of time. Well all of them now would simply be settled. So allow yourself to begin right now being right here. You know focus on what you're going to have in 48 hours. Well that does not mean that you cannot allow your desires to make themselves as eric but then ground yourself to what's available and retain them if that is the most exciting option but remind yourself what's right in front of you. All that is more relevant right now than speculating something which will not play out in the way you are assuming anything. I was going to ask if there was any particular aspect that I should focus on in upcoming two weeks relative to the process of uncounting and the don't. Well I have just maintained the grounded focus in the moment take a vacation from passing and teaching. And if the symbol is once I step off the plane or you set that there is a symbol passageway point I will be in the now all well and do whatever it says but the idea is take a vacation from spending your now moments creating recreating a path that you do not prefer and projecting a pewter which you prefer even little and the fear not for in this place again but there's an increase. Ah I said with him don't ask you that. By the way that is another expression of a loud what you call ah is the releasing into the flow re-establishing the white thing. What is the question this is most often? The idea is that you are presenting yourself with all furnaces and now beginning to see as you say if your colloquial money is for your mouth are you going to do something which does not excite you to get the money to do something which does and by that time you no longer have any practice doing anything that excites you anywhere or are you going to begin to look at what does excite you and within the offer oh wow yourself to at least access within that offer what actually is exciting about now if it is something within the doing of the job all well and good go right ahead if it is what the job will allow you to do you may wish to skip a few steps and simply decide how you can do that yeah so it is simply a matter of again commitment and willingness to decide will I buy into the lifestyle where I am constantly getting money to do the things that excite me at the cost of my excitement or will I begin to incorporate my excitement into what i'm doing or will I begin to allow my excitement to show me a new direction very exciting I wanted to talk about allowing people to come up that we didn't do anything I will well um so a child came into my classroom who would have obviously been a severely and I knew that I had a very strong charge around oh why because I was confused at the time I get difficulty opposed to I found myself having to complete dichotomy within me in the during the day I pushed the system as hard as it can be pushed and valid force to get something done to help me try and then when I was I was like the adult either in the day when I was being gone home I would be each in my fear of being lost and I I went to a process of now by the way all you are doing is watching this all for the so you are however doing so in a very creative way for you are supplying yourself with a scenario that you can act upon whereas back then part of what you recreate now about that supposed back then was a feeling in ability to act so act do what you can do and as those fears come up you can now bravely face them for you now have the ability to do something in victory and I did see that that that I am powerful and that I can do and I also but I also experienced with all started from getting a letter from my father and I have spoken in 20 years and I decided I wanted to communicate again and now I've been seeing again I couldn't if you had me in my life that allowed me to experience my experience about being my father and what that was all about that is all part and parcel very directly of what you are actually and I wanted to I last week and I went through and I experienced it going on to the court believe about being victimized well how and what I got to bought the second last belief was I'm not not I'm not contradiction of terms but nevertheless a real-life an individual ponderous they're not but again the point is when you put it out on the table rather than keep it obscurely in the closet it no longer holds up to the wife of the day and this is what I have been saying about when you nail down the belief that no longer serves you there is a shall I say double effect the a effect is I do believe that obviously but the b effect is this is no longer relevant to who I am and the only way that it holds was me not acknowledging that it is no longer relevant to the wife my desire is to keep the past and the love and the heart of the children without well that is automatic where the fly through you is where you are willing to nurture that aspect of yourself the child with it and whatever that means to you but the point is the outlook of the time the openness without the shall I say a faction of the definition of vulnerability the willingness to see the fascinating the willingness to challenge the reality to practice these are things within you that have never died simply not been asked so it will come up in many ways but understand that each time you formulate a connection to whatever your perception is of the child within and send love to that child and simultaneously as that child feel that love you are you are realigning and a this ease date a state where ease is not the natural flow will simply tell I say reverse but through acknowledging and again perhaps in many ways in how you will judge your reality collectively this will represent in no uncertain terms what you would call the bottom of your how it's trying I also have a question from a question from a question from a question he is talking about that at that time about all all truth for all the way to being equal and that all the way to not for seemingly confident it really is well ultimately this can be re-expressed through the statement that all truth are true to those who believe but my question are are there absolute truth you know you have come here and say to us that you believe that all that is loved each of us are conditional that is our understanding spiritually and that is what we experience in our framework the portion of our framework that is quite similar to your own so through our experience of this we can share that this is so to you and then you can choose to match it or not but if you choose not to match in your reality that all that is unconditionally loves you perhaps you can say the paradox is all that is he can use to unconditionally love you I would say I would be there saying that to have well in a sense you can say it is one of the absolute perhaps we have narrowed our definitions to absolute which is quite shall I say an all-in-confident word down to three ideas number one you exist theory that is an absolute number two all is one and one is all everything is connected this is a concept this is an absolute and number three you experience the reality that you are the vibration of sometimes referred to as you so so shall you read what you put out is what you get back these are simply semantic renditions of the idea that you always experience the reality you are vibrating as in that moment now this is instantaneous what you get back is what you put out is an instantaneous expression and this is not always understood so therefore this would represent perhaps you can say general principles that in one sense of the word would be absolute other than that every other idea you consider that the way it is is an agreement and part and part of an exploration not a law but a localist in that that my terror of being victimized again has brought to many children that are being victimized and an opportunity to act upon thereby understanding that you personally are you with me can never be victimized no matter what that means in any situation that you ever attract you will never act as a business therefore you will not get the same response as you did when you acted like this and I just have one last thing I had to do in my life to share with you oh though I do sense that this will not be the last closely I have dreamed that I went into the school where I work and my principal says to me you have to go to a different place your classroom is a different place now and I said it is and he said yes you have to walk down this path you can't take your car and have to walk there first I got my shoes and I walked down the cap and I walked for a very long time it gives me about 45 minutes and I came out to a place that was by the ocean and it was a farm there and more animals there and more children there and I was very pleased with myself having a place where you also exhibited shall I say a poignant and this is perhaps somewhat humorously that you are the past you are not on a path and because you are the past wherever you are is the past you cannot be off of your but what you have drawn yourself to is your connection to the natural aspects of this choice in physical reality what you call nature as you call children but also in no uncertain terms what you call adult that way perhaps adults that are exploring that choice about the structure of the dreaming was that I'm in such a situation I work now and and that is where I want to go where I walk and I have not seen how there could be connection ah thank you and understand because all external reality is a reflection of internal reality that you carry that scene around you that scene is nowhere to go to that scene is something to bring into the moment regardless of if you are physically there how you felt can always be called forth and when you are feeling it calling it forth in order to experience it you are that is why sometimes you do not all understand but when we speak of calling up the referential preferential you and you view what this you would do perhaps again a little sneaky but the idea is while in order to view this while you are viewing it you are that it is an exercise in bringing forth that presentation of yourself in order to imagine something in order to call it forth you are being it in the moment and this is why you create an effect from your path you call forth a path you are not bringing anything from a path to the present you are recreating an identification you are recreating an effect in the present the present is the only experiential path therefore your power always lies in the present who seems to continue to do this through recognition through awareness of the mechanism itself and that is always as simple as that sounds will that retiree we will communicate again that will not be the last perhaps the season proceed with heaven may can i read recently about something called a chest lock experiment where where someone's a theory was someone could extend the antenna from her home and draw the energy from the atmosphere to meet all the power needs well the idea being that there would also be shall i say a sending device that would create a frequency that can be passed it was not speaking of tapping the inherent electromagnetic field but tapping a field that was created through a feedback system with an impulse a circular wave and the electromagnetic field of your planet what power is the alpha is the energy to be drawn in well in other words you would have what you call large transmission antenna and then various receptive analogies on shall i say whatever device will draw from the power much as you're ready a way sending and receive self-attaining cyclos is more energy drawn in than needs to create the energy in a sense it is self-attaining but perhaps it is more the idea of demonstrating that what you call electricity can be transmitted wirelessly and you will then find again societally that it is not necessary to send that poll there is actually a way to shall i say step off the frequency of the planet itself but it demonstrated possibility how can we then draw in electricity to power home well again first of all i draw your attention to your own literature upon your own planet which exists to begin to experiment and attract them any ideas which already exist and once you have experientially created a foundational understanding i can then discuss things which do not exist upon your planet but it will require shall i say some input from me for now research into what already exists if that excites you will be able to get a lead or an aid is well heifer as well you will find through patented material and so forth and various societies that many of the quote unquote suppressed notions can at least be accessed as a concept okay um a question about channel i read something and i felt it about half of what the channel was saying intuitively felt right to me and the other half felt wrong and what it seems that the stuff that you say intuitively at least to me seems very accurate and loving that is a perspective with thank you from other from other stuff is channel like in this connecting like magazine i read uh there was some stuff that i thought didn't seem quite as loving or seem judgmental or seem to be stating the future and i know what you said is not the thing of the prediction well that is a prediction of one of the probable pieces which again is somewhat arbitrary since there are an infinite number but we point your attention to the preferred probable future so you can set those up as a template whereas those operate on perhaps you can say dated methodologies dated the least 50 that change could only come with great shall i say cataclysm so well that that the part that i like about it is that they said the change of this planet is going through our evolution doesn't happen with a lot of trauma like california doesn't have to fall into the atmosphere absolutely not it is not likely that it works but it is likely that some pressure will be released in that area okay the question i had about channel so was it it seemed i was wondering if the channel was saying something that's judgmental or that is is a statement of fact about the future which is impossible is it because they broke up to a spirit that somehow isn't clear say it's clear as you appear to be to me or because that end or because the channel has their own issues that are getting in the way and they know what you are saying as the channel having own issues will be the only thing that could allow a an entity in that sense who was not well-meaning were such a thing to exist could only express itself to an individual with enough families to extract it so it is either that idea or purely the filtration of the belief system of the challenge one of the other now understand again that there are very long three conceptions that you will create in your life and this applies to the many times so in general you will hear a flavor from those beliefs if those beliefs are very limiting if those beliefs are very negative it will in general translate into the information that overtones of limitation and negative so when i'm reading something like that you can experiment and just take what seems right to me and blow it since i would perhaps suggest that you view it as a very large grab bag and if you do not like what you have gotten for the task but the idea is that they all eat even the things that you in no way shape or form preferred to experience are absolutely equal to everything else and part of the shall i say process that allows you to choose what you want to do is to grant validity to the thing you do not the tendency to simply continue the idea to believe that a belief that you do not prefer has more weight than one that's up now that in and of itself is a belief but it is also an expression of not acknowledging the limit for the acknowledgement of it is your saying i can handle it it is not bigger than me i am willing to work at it on equal current then choosing a new and acting according to the new idea gives more weight to the new idea experiential one of one of the things i wasn't sure about on this this channel thing that i read was uh the transformation that that were in said something like five percent of people that don't want to transform are going to go to some you know that is an arbitrary figure but understand you can only experience the reality that you are the vibration of and individuals have the full free will to choose not in that sense to even transform the fourth density they get a reality they are not the only one in exile in reality therefore their apparent is that the earth will continue to be a winnitor your apparent is that i have not seen them in a long time where they go um also it's one of the things that i'm sensing is that in hearing that we're approaching a very kind precipitous shifting in in our power structures well yeah i do not completely evidence no matter what your preconceived idea is that you are firmly with the impact even utilizing external feedback upon your final episode you are obviously in a major cycle mate there is nothing so mysterious about so the question becomes how do you wish to create your participation in it and therefore you're a Syrian uh i want to follow my excitement but part of my excitement is to be a part of helping the transformation move in a loving way well understand that that will be what you accomplish but only for the individual to be and you have absolutely no responsibility or any ability to control at all the individuals who do not so understand you have become by choice a specialist and allow your specialty to attract those who it will serve not taking responsibility for those who do something else very and one more question well for now allow that to sink in perhaps we will fear again this evening it will pretend but trust and allow that to think a lot back there hello um one of the articles from nag magazine in white mention um statistics oh and um why would they build and um how would they build oh now on the fan that you have many piro means which still exists in your ancient Egypt we will confine our discussion to the oldest what are generally referred to as the great period for that in a sense was the model that in an sense was the template although it is assumed societally perhaps you can say archaeologically that the great pyramid will represent the newest the most perspective it is in that sense of the oldest as well as what you call the state which is also not well known and understood it was as you would count time created approximately 10 to 12.5 thousand years ago it was created for various reasons one of the reasons is that it provides its aimer that is conducive in that sense for what you call astral travel because of the particular alignment of electromagnetism that occurs one of the ideas that it has functioned as is what you would colloquially refer to as an arial marker therefore it should in a sense orient one or or an one from the sky without the need of use of instrument in that sense one other idea that it represented is what you call the ability to communicate what you would call a transceiver and thereby allowed communications with various other structures some of which your scientists and archaeologists have discovered some of which are still quite varied in that sense perhaps you may understand that their creation was a combination of ingenious uses of web which in that way would be understood to have been lost by your society and no longer needing that now that you have your machine a read but also was employed the idea you would call the sonic levitation or sonic nullification of gravity by a particular vibratory frequency so therefore they were vibrated into place as many of the older pyramids that no longer exist were but this was only what you would call the uppermost forces of the great pyramid itself much of the base was created through again ingenious means of leverage and also certain machinery which then was in that sense removed from your plan does that answer the question that is another discussion all together and one which we will read for certain explorations on many of your parts but which we will be in a future interaction if this machinery was moved did earth people create pyramids or did alien pyramids be reinforced? he was what you would call a joint venture but we will refrain in that sense from saying alien for those there were experts for rest real connections many of them by that point had been quite terrestrial for quite an interview and we're at least about it all at that time in the way that you mean not necessary with more of a cooperative effort for various reasons perhaps you may understand that some of it would smack a place and you do them all day not read this pre-gates that idea they wanted to get special powers too and i guess the only special powers would be the um the um can't see it at the end of that well again perhaps you can say what will be most relevant for that will be its ability to function as a specific focusing lens for a shearic energy and electromagnetic energy of the planet itself that will be as that exponent because of that property there were certain ideas that again used to exist within them that utilize the advantage of that property that we will be stuck in other times so how did property flow? no well the idea is yes they still have that property but they are not harnessing that property through some of the shall i say materials that they then use which were later released in the way that you are saying that much of the technology does not exist nor does the material they don't have any self-power tools well yes they still have that same focusing ability therefore one can go in there and create through alignment what you call the experience, experience, experience one can in that sense utilize it to facilitate what you call absolute rejection one can utilize it to facilitate literally perhaps at first it would seem for your imagination but various forms of travel that would also include time travel well perhaps old discovery brought to you no it is already occurring will continue to occur we do not have any evidence shall i say restfold of a major discovery but they do which chamber is the one branch of travel with king changes? what you would perceive what you are asking would refer to the king's changes or that is located in a particular area of total what you call queen stambert is more centrally located in the field hey one moment are you sure? we saw a program recently that we think some kind of radio waves they covered that there's also another pocket of air maybe another chamber that haven't yet been found do you know anything about this or what am i saying? all that i can share with you is it will be found to be quite empty as well it was part of the functioning of the pyramids there are also shall i say shallow chambers located layered above what you call king chamber but this is already understood by your society right okay so where was it to be located in relation to the king in the field? no problem thank you for asking the original purpose of the room of that particular chamber again it was one of the chambers through which in the insertion of particular material which no longer exists allowed in that sense for there to be the storage area of what you would call certain styles of energy surely you were talking about it crystal entrusters of various pipes and other metallic ids so that's where people are getting the idea of crystals and say within the chambers and there were various so that were located through various lite the areas of the pyramids are we in that sense to have the opportunity to visit them together many of these have been pointed out to the stone you say no longer exist they were in that sense man well it is a long story a fascinating story you may understand that also did that pyramid have capability you would call as departing as this may seem weaponry and that there were certain individuals shall we say walled up within you and when they in that sense through the negotiations process release themselves the individuals who were doing the perfect training shall i say came in and basically cleaned up they were very closely engrossed in what you would call an early war upon the climate as you mentioned that the libraries and the uh the low the pyramid well that is one way to understand there are various chambers which in that sense campaigns vary in ideas are these three great pyramids connected by underground uh tunnel there are connections and each each pyramid i understand there's three libraries is that each under each pyramid that is not our particular understand in a sense anything can be referred to as a lite for all reality is hologressed and therefore each point contains the whole as shall i say unusual as this may seem so your ability to access any of the information is up here and there's still there's no uh spaceship underneath the thing in the third density that you are understanding no there is however various objects that you would consider to be wads within your class one very large metallic object in particular ah your scientists are beginning to be aware of this people i go in the same area in the making of these great city of advances in this commercial all these days it was in that sense a center of various activities it was a particular shall i say coordinated centers that coordinated with many of the other ancient sites that no longer exist upon the face of the planet others that do in remnants in it's natural natural to see it's Asia the whole the Asia is nervous in it's not well you would consider it to be a continent unsolicited but there were shall i say various abilities to connect via what you would call boat travel air travel that act as a union has to be here well in a sense yes but it is not by any means the only five seconds in a sense only one of the several faithful executive is to read that the means the surface of the ocean you know in case you're interested in well to some degree you will find much of this who have been destroyed and in that sense worn down by what you call the elements there are some artifacts that can still be recovered and there are some pyramids which have been answered by humans in what you call diving just to answer my own question okay did not mean to jump the gun didn't we just interest us that way but i understand that pyramids were pyramids of those pyramids that is one that is larger beneath the surface of the ocean and any kind of the kind of land yes and we'll take care of you again designed for the same reason that you described it what's similar it is so functional what you would understand to be some of the aforementioned material will exist within it but it is unlikely that shall i say will be utilized in the way that would allow it to function in the same way and in one particular instance one particular major component has been removed well in other words individual exploring it goes to take it upon himself to remove a particular cliff might there be a craft located in the area of the mountain there is a possibility that you would find a remnant but perhaps not one in fact oh quickly Floyd all at once what you refer to generally as your biblical great flood would represent the final subvert and that would approximately be 13,000 of your music no stand as land to represent man's exploration of materiality at the core of spiritual out and perhaps i need to say no for the idea is as a whole being you cannot function slice and distribute yourself so the idea is that you can explore physicality but need not be so at the core of your connection and when you lose or shall i say create an transparency that you are not connected you function from what you call desperation you're only understanding of how you improve yourself that you have any effect any people on your reality is to force and dominate and improve and that idea then attract other individual relationship and then that creates what you generally refer to as workers this overall concept literally took the place of it but it was also an exploration that is now recopitulated by what you call your united city or you are at a similar juncture with a very strong degree of potential for not making a criminalist but the total abilities do not only annihilate your confidence at the time therefore perhaps in many sense of the word you may understand you are at land to sue with your life well i'm sorry i'll be sitting on a phone and i'll be like a real more well what many individuals have many final questions you're saying that it may have to set the authority at that point you want to be destroyed no i am saying you're the United States as at Atlantis had the ability to destroy itself has the ability to destroy itself and the rest of your class so there is a similar exploration where you are at a similar shall i say point but now that you have played out the negative results you are now exploring the positive of that is that all and hey man it says that an entity found an identity or off the moon well that is simply a reference point where remnants may be found and in fact in that case a road that runs right from the remnant in what you call the death is that where there's the pyramid there It would relate more to what you refer to as though perhaps not directly but in the vicinity of what you call Bermuda fly-in. That is one of the reasons that I have suggested that there is an unlike with it in their recovery without a drastic shift in your mass concert. Those such a shift would then allow for that extra. Is this a disappearance in that area? Well, perhaps they understand that some of their technology has an attention already existing vortex and therefore has a magnified effect which again you'll very strongly align anyone who is within so therefore if your orientation is negative that's what you do and then you'll be in the digital to a gone-in-and-adpersonally. Literally, you're positive or negative orientation determines your experience. You're willing to go into what you refer to as that vortex with full conviction and integrity will in that sense allow you to move the well, I believe that from entering to a gate to another dimensional experience to physical drop. Oh, shift, this is true. Well, many times again they were simply submerged. Other times they simply were in the right place at the right time to utilize a ripple within that magnetic field as a little bit more dual. Well, that's it. Oh, thanks. Hey, you missed the fact. The effect you were calling the enhancement of the vortex? Yes, it was fact. Low in other words, better as a fluctuating energy field base and within the occurrences of it, I'll risk. But what is artificially enhanced? Well, what you will find very, or shall I say, were you to dive in the area of the United High? You would find a particular, shall I say, remnants technology from Atlantis that automatically enhanced it. It's associated with hermium. Well, perhaps, perhaps, perhaps, thank you. Did you say that Atlantis was familiar with the Great Great Sound? We said it was limited shook the parts. More confusing that perhaps is what you refer to as now. You said it's a piece of patient-friendly answer. So they say it's developed a technology that literally shook them apart. That was now death of planet in North Carolina. How was it being destroyed? I know the flooding was the final of my experience. The prior season, there was what you slowly called various forms of school. And you threw the electromagnetic sposivity of that area and shall I say inherent instability, which very often shall I say, the bruising of weaponry and agitation. Right, and what technology would they use it? Do you use a pyrotechic or would they use it? Well, who's under this? 8-5-9, is it sound technology? There were versions of what you would call nuclear technology missile technology. And there are many examples in what you call your ancient writing that's restricted by the way. Right down to what you would certainly, biblically, as thought about today. Now the great term is, was that a enclave of certain Italians? Well, that was hard of the inhabitation, but not the whole. The Atlantic is what you're responsible for is destruction and the development and implementation of the technology. If you wish to be some sweetly precise, you may understand that there was an involvement with the initiation phase on another diagram. But again, who have lived upon your planet for many times a thousand. And what would be nature and the, what was the cause of the conflict? What was the, what was the, that particular conflict that we are seeking of as war and tyranny? Yes. We are in that sense to understand that it will represent what you would generally refer to as territorial, considering. Between which two people are. This is for a piece of conversation, but you may understand to be very powerful and or entity. When the Atlantic? No. You may understand that some of them would from time to time visit and habitate in Atlantis. So in that sense, yes, they were Atlantia, but they were not told. I say, and the group that, um, exactly the disarming of the tournament, uh, was that one of the opposing factions? It was at a third party altogether. Well, it would be the time to be done. Well, from my perspective, from their perspective, they were the good guys. So what was the question? You know what I'm asking, you had two opposing groups. One of them had the pyramid and had it armed with certain technologies and had a more capability. It was disarmed. Was it disarmed by one of the opposing groups or was it disarmed by a third party doing the thing? Oh, without getting too precise, understand, for now that there were basically the idea of two main parties, if you will, and the dispute was a thing that. And who affected me? Disarming, other. We wish right now to refer from utilizing race. That will come in the future, because of the case numbers in higher countries. Can I ask you? The group that was in possession of the tournament, and they are misbalanced. Before you proceed, both groups came as one group. Then there was some, shall I say, consideration that resulted in the federal rule of the team, or now allow us to wrap the time. And to you. One more question on that in my mind. Let me know. Three minutes. A couple of things that you said, one was you currently disaster technology in the United States to now when you swear I felt like the rest of the planet, you mean the planet itself or the place that we know are the countries? Well, technically both, but more than likely it would in that sense result in being the one. Now, there is no propensity behind the planet longer. And that consciousness has decided not to do so. From our perspective, it is simply shall I say an option. OK. And just to complete what I was talking about before, would be the other chamber. The Egyptians came out of the youth, and used the tournament with the great tournament. This was an existing structure. Well, understand, when they used it, they had no awareness of what you call upper training. They were pure coverage. So their particular involvement in the youth together will be in the lower courts, also understand that because they did not have awareness of the upper table. This is why all other pyramids that you are aware of in Egypt only have a lower training. What chamber did they use to pick? Well, basically. And that's it. Basically. So the king of the king will make a terminology, king, and king. Well, this was added much later to what you would call romanticize links. So what about the sarcophagus that they found? That is not a sarcophagus. That is an insulated box made of a particular, shall I say, a material that allowed it to insulate certain, shall I say, energy and confine them to an area to utilize them to focus for other purposes. Now, other pyramids contain the mimicking of this idea. And many times, shall I say, subsequent interpretation of them as a sarcophagus. So that came first, and then it was mimicked afterwards. Thank you. OK. And you will find that in its, shall I say, removal of content the sarcophagus itself was done. And when in your modern age, it was finally uncovered that such a chamber existed, that damage was already done. I heard someone say, I think it was from a child, so it's a tech model and you have the almost controlled panel within it. Is that the other one? It will vary from your present understanding of that, but ultimately have the same effect. OK. So the Egyptians really basically realized that tech can not just pass against it. Well, again, when they created a lower chamber, it did not resemble what you are calling the thing. So to them, it was simply the chamber. So the smaller chamber you're saying, the same? I'm not just turning it on, I guess. The point is what you are calling the pit, which is a roughly formed tablet. Understanding that they believe that to be the only chambers then built pyramids, only with chambers in the bottom. But they were not complete, shall I say, copies of the form you are calling the fix in its rough size. They were shall I say, smooth walls, it's what you call hieroglyphic inscriptions. But sometimes those were added late. And also, some particular structures were built, which were then subsequently sometimes thousands of years used later by a particular what you might call pharaoh or king. And then as your history unfolded, it was described that that pharaoh or king hadn't healed this when they had not. And then, thanks. Oh, thanks. At this time, I will ask you to trust and allow that this is the time to complete this intellectual. I remind you that the process of formulating dialogue, formulating questions, answers, statements on the upcoming topic of clarifying your vision will, in a sense, give you a head start in doing that. It is my intention, in that sense, in speaking at the beginning of the interaction, to lay down a foundation that will cause within you an initiation of that vision. If you already contain the vision, it will be an enhancement of it. Then, at the beginning of the second half of the interaction, we will, in that sense, together in what you call meditative state, explore your vision. All right. We therefore again, once again and for the first time. Thank you for your willingness to co-create this ecstatic interaction with us. It is our desire to continue to act with you in this way and therefore our allowance that it will occur. We have no insistence, but again, the desire in that sense leads us to continue to co-create this interaction with you at this time. It's thank you for your willingness to expose yourself to yourself. As you do an old, what you already do, so you then can change it if you so desire. Do not in the process, however, forget that there are many things you already believe which you like and that you can use them. It is not that you are completely functioning from David's beliefs. So recognize where you already utilize the empowered beliefs and use that as a reinforcement when you change through acknowledgement and the other beliefs. Honor your desire and relax, your goodness. Take a deep breath and sigh. Remuscing your music control out of a notion of lack of control and exercising your total control through a lot. I bid you a most thought and thought. But it's easier and easier. But when you do not feel less concepts, you have more health skills orahids and experiences. So we�nt think of success. Where you wish to reflect on your desire and change of ways you suffer. The spiritual taste of yournational realization of hope that physical relaxation comes from thoughts that people may not be able to read, as a, became most experienced in a divineith. As we scripture,
