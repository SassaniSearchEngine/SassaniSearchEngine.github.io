 Before we continue, allow a few adjustments. A while to communicate with you in the following way. Forst of all, understand that, though we present ourselves on an individual or the convenience of interacting directly with what you perceive yourself to be an individual. We are a representational energy. We represent many billions inside of individuals and are representative of the association of the world itself, though we will interact with you and individuals we perceive you in that sense are parts of one old crystal. Therefore our interactions with you will be from the perspective that there is one whole consciousness presenting many faces, many aspects, many perspectives. Therefore we now allow the interaction between of this representation of our consciousness with the first perspective of your mass consciousness. Do proceed. Hey, we recognize this perspective of the whole. Thank you very much. I have several wonderful announcements. I am happy to announce that Sergei Krikalov has returned to Earth safely on March 25th. Please be seated. Five months later than originally planned. In last session here, I was able to recall a made-up plea for the assistance of the Zeta if that was needed. It was not necessary, had not been forgotten. At any rate, we all welcome home Sergei and thanks to all parties, the small fifth or the sink return after, yet this 313 days of space, we will guard me as we call that wow. As a frequent co-creator of Kages to celebrate, I suggest that March 25th be made into Sergei Krikalov day to honor patients and trust in the time. With I do, for that perspective, do proceed. As close person for world harmony, I would like to indicate that agreement has been reached in the matter of finding a suitable day for interworlds to the communications day. All right. This will be October 15th. Individuals wanting to participate may communicate with world harmony via Android until we establish an office here in the US. You may understand if you wish that day, your October 15th of your 1992 year to be the beginning of a particular gateway of energy that will extend to your March 15th 1993 through which it will be most conducive for individuals to begin to walk in step with their purpose and their will in that sense be much up this time from all aspects of your being in that climate. And therefore, this would be most conducive a day to kick off as you say this idea. Wonderful. Then as a provisional US coordinator, boy who of her name, I'm recommending that people everywhere in order to make their lives more abundant set up what we call our equal exchange bar system. This system goes side by side with a monetary exchange system. The only rules to playing equals 10 are you do only what you love doing. You may be a brain surgeon, but if you think that the love breaking leaves sign on as a leaf rager. Also an hour equals an hour. If you put three hours of work into the system, you're entitled to see three hours back. The only thing you love doing is curling wooden whistles out there somewhere as a mother who needs a child's sitter, able to charge real business. We are fighting for this methodology will begin to allow your civilization to in that sense respect each other as individuals all equal and you're willing that to in that sense. If you see each other as equal, then enables you as a society to truly be in attitude equal to us. And that is what will allow our direct hint of action. Therefore we applaud your creative idea. And we thank you for sharing the perspective of your totality that you consider yourself to be next interaction, next place of the whole thing I do. I just want to treat the opportunity in this form to send my greeting to all of you. It is a way to say that return. Thank you. And to thank you for your patience with me. There are many many streams of society consciousness that are sharing with you through your expression. Your willingness to loosen up your grip of it will enable things which are quite different from what you generally perceive to be difficult life to come through in a free form fashion. It is not necessary unless it excites you to label these four simply appreciate them and share them with those that find themselves attracted and understand that the function is served by individuals attracting these images into their reality what you call your pictures. You enable us in a sense from our end in a very non interfering way to begin to allow individuals to acclimatize to the many differing ways that the many societies of the association present themselves in physical form. Therefore we thank you as well. Thank you specifically. I did listen up like a family of a day and day. I created an interesting being of water being very deep. No exactly in that sense. Understand that it is a medium that would be less fluid than what you consider your water to be but thicker than what you consider to be your air atmosphere. It is truly extra dimensional. Okay. That explains why I couldn't get the water right. You got it adjusted perfectly but had judged your creation. Exactly. Thank you. Thank you as well. Pro scene two presents the next phase. Representation of the whole. Thank you. I don't know how to address you. What's your name? Again we are the collective energy and simply the association or perhaps the galactic. Your energy feels completely different from the line. Yes it is again a composite energy and I want you consider to be aligned by sure our individual. They are also facilitated by other individual. There are however more by quite a bit in this blending. There is a softness and I felt my heart open even more when you came in. I saw colors, creams. I don't know what that's about. In a sense it is the transmission of consciousness visualized by you but also understand that your attraction to this face that we present being that it is representative of many extraterrestrial world shows you in no uncertain time that you are interested in the aspect of the interaction as well. Well I wasn't going to come tonight and I had a dream a few nights ago that seemed to signal me to be here. If I were contributing it correctly that something special was going to happen and I was sorry in the dream I missed it so I wanted to make sure that I really was here. You may understand the beginning of this interaction to be that as well and not simply one aspect of it. There are certain ideas that will read and fathise for you. I have a personal question for my son but I guess I sort of am also curious as to did you come here specifically to deliver a particular message separate from what was given in the very beginning. In a sense it is simply to expand the definition of these interactions and to begin to allow all the consciousness to communicate through this channel from time to time when it is deemed appropriate. It is in a very real sense a forging of new channels and opening within the channel. It is also as well since you cannot separate yourself from this idea and opening in any individual who chooses to be present this evening. Therefore you are all also individually and collectively expanding your ability to communicate with the rich and fertile multiverse not desolate and barren as has been imagined. Therefore it is representative of a generalized expansion in awareness in that you are now able to interact with other aspects of the association. My personal question was that my son has been going to quite a bit of ups and downs this week and I was mentioning that to Andrew and he said his children were going to stop too. We were thinking maybe this was the week of changes in children. Would you like to comment on that or specifically about my son? It is simply a motto if you will of in that sense, testing as you say, boundary, stretching the definition of who they are and allowing in that stretching in that expansion the feedback from those they have chosen to coexist with. Thereby enabling you in their exploration, their self-discovery to in a loving way acclimate them into your very society. And to you we thank that perspective of the totality and again open up dialogue and communication with the next representative Fattic of the whole. I am very happy that you will us tonight. It is very joyful and I see a lot of joy coming from you as well. It is our always ecstatic joy to in this sense filter through physiological manifestation as a totality to again expand the definition of the interactions between us and then presupposes that there are many individuals in corrected which brings up great joy. I would like to talk about an excitement that I am going to, it is going to certain motions to get there but it is going to happen. Alright, why we asked you a question. When will you begin to facilitate your connection to the Pleiadian Society? I have been going to sleep with my breathing exercises carefully and my sleep before I go on my sleeping train stay to do so. We are speaking of while you are awake. Dream contact is one option. We are speaking about you now being consciously willing to initiate dialogue while awake. And dialogue while awake, does that be considered a direct dialogue between two people? In a sense you may utilize that symbol. Yes. I am okay because it is very interesting to bring that question up. I have been thinking very joyfully about I visit a friend of mine in an area where it is pre-concluded enough to have a meeting directly where it would be late at night on my way home on Tuesday night. I have thought about this and I have sort of visualized this area of farms. And I visualize in my mind the joy that this would be a perfect spot for me to be able to equally share in my love with the Pleiians without any hesitation whatsoever involving the opposite and validate that whole connection which I feel very, very lovely about. So I am ready for that. We simply suggest that from their end. They allow you to have the cue that they are prepared. I am going to say this to you. Can you just explain a little bit for me? Hey sit down, close your eyes and initiate communication. Period. Okay. All right. We thank you. I had a question but now. Do you feel safe with your own credit? I just saw actually with more of a sharing. I have a thing called the Interglasses TV Network which I talked about vaguely. And I was going to get into it before. It was simply that my whole joy is to bring extra terrestrial beings onto the show at some point to be able to talk to the people and also interact with others on the show. And go beyond some of the TV programming and the media that has just limited itself to just saying well this just exists or does that exist. So as I want to go beyond that to the joyfulness of allowing for the extraterrestrials who wish to partake I am sending out that message to all of you that you are welcome on my show. The message will be safe and if it is to obey that your interest will continue. This will be possible physically. Although perhaps not for what you would call a few years. So it will depend on your interest in this direction at that time. I have a one question about a woman in a dream I had. This was like a couple weeks back and I didn't even mention it. I think the name was Tania or Tania. Does that ring a bell at all? What is the significance of it to you? It seems very strong that this person was a physical being a woman obviously. All right now understand this will be representative of an aspect of your play idea and connection and is more precisely Tania. That is all we will share and understand. It is enough. We thank you and allow for one more face one more perspective to interact with us in this way at which time we will in that sense convert this interaction to Elan. Over there. First I would like to welcome you and secondly I would like to ask you to continue the number one turn from light on the initial formation of the appreciation and number two to thank you again for coming to us at this time and maybe tell us other ways that you have met or contacted other planets when they were ready. If it was primarily in this way to small sections of the population who were ready for it or if it is one methodology but very often as you have elucidated when they are ready they are ready to interact physically. Therefore it will depend upon the focus of the consciousness upon the planet in the society and civilization that will determine what degree we are then able without interfering in the development of any civilization to approach. In some particular instances there will be the preparing and preparation in this way. In some instances it will be direct with particular portions of populations of planets and in particular shall we say more rarefied in consent there will be the sensing of the readiness for a map landing at which time we are accepted as a society by the society so it can vary greatly depending on the amount of focus of consciousness on the amount of that society's orientation towards separation or integration. Very briefly you may understand that the association of worlds which is comprised of many hundreds of societies has been in that sense an association for many tens of thousands of your years and very ancient in that way. You may understand that several societies initially forming this association did parallel lead develop and found themselves synchronistically in a particular style of agreement in contact at which time formal arrangements what you might my refer to as treaties in your language however that is not exactly the idea for we were not war fairing civilizations we have since in growing in expanding and absorbing only through the will of other civilizations increase greatly in numbers and as we do this increases the amount of approaches available toward interacting and continuing to expand if you will the network of consciousness working in tandem that we refer to as the association does that answer the question. Thank you. Our strongest perception will be that that will occur within as soon as five of your meals on to 10 to 15 of your years that will depend upon certain decisions that are made within your mass consciousness you in that sense have a direct relationship to those decisions by your willing estimate personal individual facets decisions you are a part of the whole and it is reflected in you therefore your willingness to transform your consciousness in that way will seem to transform the consciousness of the mass as well for you will then be on a different frequency altogether therefore can be quite seen the most likely initial contact in this way if parameters are to remain similar to how they are presently standing will be ridiculous and understand that they are not full fledged if you will remember of the association if this is to transform their other possibility will that do therefore allow us again to express to you that we do view you all at the same time that we view you individually as again different reflective surfaces of one whole mass consciousness therefore from our mass consciousness of many worlds many consciousness and many civilizations to your multifaceted crystal of consciousness we send out continued greetings and unconditional love one moment all right continue sharing we thank you for your willingness to applaud yourself especially when I meditate answer the phone will that stop if I listen will that stop for ringing if you do not insist that it must yes you need not have a particular rigid expectation you can simply if you will answer the phone see what happened allow the exchange to provide you with information in this regard ask the same question once you have picked up a phone how do I do it if you wish since this interaction has taken this form simply in a meditative state visualize the phone ringing when you hear it walk over in your imagination pick it up say hello and listen to what comes on the other that symbol will enable you in an acceptable way to access other consciousness thank you and you need no dime nor do you ever get a busy signal therefore earthling phone home all right oh thank you do understand the sense of humor will always be the rendering but never have its full impact till it is perceived and interpreted appropriately so we thank you for your willingness to get the joke hey one moment are you through yes I am thank you very much we thank you I'm going to go see you Christmas the weekend after Christmas I was standing on a June cross in Florida with my sister and Bill here beside me and we were talking about you folks and we got up to leave we're walking away something maybe turned back and look back over the ocean and as I did I saw the outline of the spaceship and with the portal there was square there weren't around it blowed enough for me to clearly see it and then with gone and my sister thought to you and I said did you see that and I'm you know what are those things that happened you think well I must be crazy if you say so well did I you saw something and the reason for the hesitation is that the way that these crap travel in a sense they isolate themselves in time and space when they do so and initiate what you may call an isolation field around them that enables this isolation of time and space they can appear more ghost like or etheric therefore you perceived amongst other things the transition of isolation that is resulting in the ghost like quality. Oh yeah now what will you do now what does it allow you to discover within yourself that you can now act upon? Well I think you can make contact. Oh very good and for your willingness to also place a phone call. Oh shut it. Over there. Come on. Hello. Great. Earlier you had mentioned that nothing really fell back from us. Again only what you define in other words when you feel you deserve it nothing is withheld. At first because of your relationship with timing it may seem that it doesn't come when you want it to but when you get into flow with the timing accepting it for how you've already created it and begin to move with your reality rather than so to speak against it. You establish a flow of timing whereby things do actually then begin to come even when at least closer to when you prefer. So by utilizing the timing that already exists you create a flow and momentum with that timing whereby it can become more consciously preferential. I was going to ask I still let my holding back of fully communicating my feelings with myself and others at times perhaps from a childhood belief or fear of lack of approval. Fair enough what is your invested interest in containing to use that belief. There's no interest in containing. Oh right. So in a sense you can say as we had shared earlier it is one choice within you. We suggest the utilization of the methodology shared at the beginning of this interaction in this regard creating with your imagination the entire scenario the entire prism and then perhaps when you share with us again the conversation will be a bit different and you will understand not only that you can choose something else but how you could not have gotten to where you are without the other perspective. Therefore it is not extraneous and will actually allow your growth and expansion the very same symbol that perhaps you have utilized to hold you back. I'll use that. Hold your creation. And to you. Over there. Hi. At the last interaction you said that my agreement was in full swing. Yes. That's kind of surprising because I thought. What was meant by that is your relationship with what you have called a copy is in full swing and often when the thoughts and communications from that individual are so closely mirroring your own you invalidate. Therefore understand that you are identifying with each other very strongly you are very similar. Therefore begin to validate the similarity as well as only utilizing the differences to define that is him this is me there is over left by definition this is what allows you to even identify with each other strongly enough in unconditional love to be able to communicate in that way. So even though I haven't been. Crossing what you've got. So we still are communicating. Never so. Simply your willingness to validate it or define it in a particular unpeperential way perhaps has increased. But now that you are aware of it is your choice to transform it. You already know much of the information that he has to share therefore if something comes that you know convey that and trust the timing of your receiving. Thank you. The other question I've been doing every minute. I was there. I was just. Oh you are not about to say but are you. You have to remember layers to that situation I've been following that suggestion very thoroughly and I'm ready to look at something else. It deserves ability. Word. And again the reminder that you are always unconditionally marked. Step into that frequency that vibration draw your strength from that vibration and recreate your version of it. Directing that unconditional love inward very. Would you like me to make it more complicated. Simply when you doubt which is not a lack of trust but as a trust in something you just do not prefer. Define acknowledge where you are placing your trust as one choice. Define and acknowledge where you wish to place your trust as another choice. Participate in the exercise shared earlier. Remind yourself that you are unconditionally loved and unconditionally means you cannot lose that love and then allow yourself to feel that love since you are unconditionally loved it is automatic and is constant. You can always feel it if you simply allow and invite the feeling to be prevalent once you feel it you can mimic it you can in that sense become that same vibration treat yourself with the same respect and that will re-align you toward positive action. Is there any way that one can beat up their timing or is it trusting your timing or is it already a person who can beat up their timing. Your willingness to follow your excitement flawlessly accelerates the timing and in fact allows you to create less time it is the time that you create to do the things which are not representative of your excitement that is creating the gap. One more question on the durability of one. Does it really realize that you have the ability to do the ability issue how can you tap into that and change that. Are you willing at all times to acknowledge the splendor of your being? Do not hesitate yes or no? Of your being. Oh thank you very easy identification. Why do you feel that way? Look at those ideas. Granthum validity. Granthum the right to exist. Granthum as being as true as what you wish and then simply look at the other choices going through the aforementioned process of stating the belief feeling it having the thoughts and projecting the actions. The new actions will differ from the old base on the old limited system of belief. Therefore you will have a new blueprint to follow. And to you. Shitting. Over there. Greetings. Tears just put some very valuable things for me this year. Oh what? Yeah wonderful tears. I wanted to share that this week I've been going through a defined transformation for me. I mean I know I've been transforming my belief system and moving on self love and unconditional love and feeling ecstatic and what an explosion of coincidence. And this week I was coming home from Andrews birthday party and a voice in my head started saying I had this feeling of sadness and I said okay what's the sadness? How is observing me? And as soon as I thought about what is the sadness it went away and I felt happy and I said oh well what do I do now? What was that and I tried to pin it down and bring it back and then every time I had a thought of separation or a thought of anything other than perfection and ecstasy it would pop out of my head and then I. There is nothing so mysterious occurring the feeling the belief of separation has the emotion of sadness lost and grief. Then you are willing to assume that particular perspective that will be the result in emotion out with it. You have also allowed yourself to similarly see the opposite and converse. So when I gave up kind of get back to that sadness figure out what it was well in the sense you transformed it by your mere willingness to express it rather than squelching and toss it back in the box. So that is all there is to it. You need not make anything more of it unless you wish to and then you can simply say any limiting belief and recreate that sadness. What happened is I discovered that no matter how what I fear or have the thought of I have an answer to that. Well very good. You are now understanding within you that even the fears that remain are no longer consistent with your new re self definition and you will find that many of the old ideas when you do begin to redefine who you are will come up so that you can now see them against the new background and they then take on a different life and then take on your expressing the ability to transform them and no longer need you and then we continue to recreate that. Therefore say goodbye wave goodbye. And as I wave goodbye that brought up a little bit of sadness of oh no I can't even feel sad anymore and then I said well you will always have the ability in that sense it will never be lost. No matter how new you are no matter how you redefine yourself you always have and will sometimes show yourself that you always will still have the ability to recreate that old view never lost. Whatever I want. Limitation will always in this plane be an option. It seems like it's almost not an option for me and more people. Oh well when individuals argue for their limitations then they get those limitations. When they allow the releasing of those limitations they begin to express unlimitedlessness. And I wanted to share with you that like tears I've been conversing with an energy lie law through is I guess a guide and a friend in non-subicality and we've been exploring with a friend of mine test as well. Just ideas and tears that we've used that the tears of that when which I thought were pertinent to me that when sometimes louder communicate I hear the words I think it's me I don't I try to make a discernment. So what you're saying I want to share. Relax. Release. And allow. Trust. That again nothing of this information is truly new to you. Therefore concentrate on what aspect of all this information that you contain becomes relevant in a given moment. Thereby utilizing your creations positively rather than invalidating them. Thank you. As we. Yes. In our culture we have a scientific theory that's called the Big Bang. Yes. You hear any validity to that? It is a localized effect. It is the manifestation of the cross section of consciousness with physicality. It is not in a sense the beginning of the entire universe. The entire universe is multifaceted and contains many kinds. It is a localized shall we say ignition of consciousness within a physical universe resulting in the formation of many galaxies but not the universe itself. You hear any correlation between that and our own preparedness for the duration. Only to the degree that you assign it. To offer a little bit about integration when I went that other entity came out before and he spoke of integration and he was integrated with more than one being. It stirred me inside and I wondered what's up. What's the integrate with other beings? Well in a sense you can understand that you are socially integrated with other beings upon your planet. This particular manifestation of that style of integration is the product of shall we say a different focus, a more expanded focus of consciousness and is not part and part of one of the definitions of the explorations one would explore within this focus physicality. You will however continue to expand and when beginning to walk in a fourth density which is still physical existence begin to fringe if you will begin to connect with more of the simultaneous expression of your beings. In that sense you can understand that it will be difficult to translate to this focus that lack of focus but the idea is that you still although you perceive many aspects and patterns to yourself perceive yourself as a discrete individual identity. Therefore at the same time that nothing is lost in terms of your individuality you also are able to express multi dimensionality, multi consciousness. Does that mean we integrate with ourselves? Well everything external to you is a reflection of you so you simply gather bits and pieces of yourself back together yes. And again we remind you the paradoxes that each and every individual experiences that gathering is happening onto them and this is one of the miracles of creation and the paradoxes of math and individuality. Hi. But how are you here? What do these crystals look like as compared to other crystals that we are we're just waking up and you said we're not quite so shiny and express to them or. Oh no no simply that you do not perceive yourself as is shining. You are always and again all expressions of consciousness from the perspective of all that is our equal. Therefore it is how individuals in a reality that has individuality perceive themselves that give the effect of the dark glass that you appear through or beginning as you say to clear that up. If we were to see ourselves the shiny beautiful crystals like reflecting the sun, symbolically with that bounce back the other way and only if you midwife it into your existence by being willing to shine and this takes the form of being willing to receive the fine who you are and then act consciously in that direction that is the shining of the soul through the physical body. Thank you. Thank you. There will be time for a few more interactions. Theodore. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much to the exercise stream to many inputs that have had written past few weeks. One moment. We are about to have Theodore's decision. Because he choose ecstasy or anger and invalidation. A bit. Both. I prefer to have both. Oh, but you say I'm going to or either or if I would have that choice then you do have that choice. First realize that you have it. Now what do you choose? I chose the ecstasy. The attack is so wonderful. Did you do it to escape the anger or to invalidate it? No I didn't. But to tell you the truth I have segmented myself and your introduction to my back that I have been segmenting myself. I was thinking of myself as perhaps 85 to 95% aligned with the ESSI and perhaps 5 to 15% aligned with the ESSI and perhaps 5 to 15% aligned with the ESSI. I don't feel too ashamed. I don't feel ashamed to go about that. Anyone on a US interstate highway I think. Now now when you say that you will only interact with the individuals that do but there are both representations. So you can drive yourself in whatever direction you wish. Yes, I will make a concerted effort to agree. They will make a suggestion in choosing ecstasy. Acknowledge the role. Acknowledge the value. Acknowledge the gift that the anger has provided in allowing you to align and from this point forward then not continue into judgment and invalidation. We allow the anger to serve you as all your creations do. We remind you that true anger lasts 10 to 15 seconds beyond which it is then judgment and invalidation of what you have just oriented yourself to. Anger allows you to see this is me that is not. Period. Therefore it serves you greatly. It enables you to touch in to feed back with who you are, what is representative of who you are and what no longer vibrates or is in resonance with who you are what you have in that sense utilized and chosen to transform. Therefore everything is of value and it is not forsaking the anger to choose the ecstasy. It is within the ecstasy understanding the role and purposefulness of even the anger as that is the creation and you can use all your creations. All good manifestors. Thank you and one more point about one of all positive manifestors. Do you believe? Okay. We heard that. Regarding the regarding. We are skilled. Regarding ecstasy. My experience with that. I have a strength that immensely over the past two theories. Is that it comes in three ways. Over three. How created please describe it. The first is a kind of inclusion. The feeling one might get when checking out a lottery ticket against the numbers written on the board. You know, finding is not a winner. There is a kind of. I don't know. And for one of the better words, we have been. We perceive implosion to imply turning within. Perhaps you can say an explosion of excitement. Well, okay. Well, the second thing is I experienced as a burning sensation of the body mechanics. In general, by the way, this will have some overtone of a resistance to the ecstasy causing a friction resulting in the burning. The ecstasy itself is quite comfortable. The third phase is very playful. It's skippling white. It is pure the light. And anyway, that's the way in which I experienced this particular emotion. We thank you and suggest that you open up to the many other ways it will come. There are not only three unless you define that they are. Well, three facets of emotion. Oh, we thank you for your willingness to share. Sharing. Oh, what? Your turn. Thank you. Explanation of history. In the Bible there are several references to the flaming chariots and wheels of fire in the light. Many of them are direct extraterrestrial influences. Thank you. When Ezekiel saw the wheel. That will be one. Okay. And the lead came out of the wheel. Worthley 80. Thank you very much. When Elijah took off in the flaming chariot. That was more of a symbolism. Ice. Yeah, a symbolizable what? In a sense transforming to non-physicality. And in a sense, re-emergent, I think, as we had our own own explain. Was it not actually leading a flaming chariot? Or something that someone of that phrase would describe as a flaming chariot? Not precisely. From our perspective. When Jesus went through his ascension, what took place there mechanically? He simply expanded his consciousness to include physicality within it rather than physicality being the whole experience. See, now the people around who witnessed that, pursued him going up into the heavens for say, what was going on there? Again, interpretation. That is, first of all, an interpretation of an interpretation of an interpretation. Shall we say an interpretation? Elana, I have a strong draw of his time house. The draw is with me the time of performing as I had come. So is it a place that's a donut called for people of rock? Have a nice trip. Thank you very much. My first impression when I first saw that place is that it's a hanger for UFOs. Any comment? Again, it is a, shall we say, very active area of interdimensional gateway vortex, if you will, and therefore in one sense, can be referred to that way. Thank you. Now the interaction with extraterrestrials and the anti-glactic confederation and the like, is that not equally available to all people in all places? Yes, but again, it will depend on their willingness to validate whatever degree this communication has initiated and most individuals seem in that sense to invalidate it at that stage. It will strengthen with your willingness to acknowledge what you have received. It is very unobtrusive. Will always allow you to believe it or not believe it until perhaps physical interaction. Then there will be enough shall we say intervalidation for you to create the outer external reflection of that validation. But the validation will first occur inwardly. Then as all external reality is, will be a reflection externally of that validation. Believing is seen. The interaction itself or the availability of interaction is directly available to all individuals that find any degree of excitement or that excitement is your sign that not only are you capable, but that it will be most effortless. I would assume that if it is necessary for a specific interaction for you to be in a certain place at a certain time. You will know, perhaps you will question where the information is coming from. You may seem to be wandering aimlessly. Willing this at that point to trust and simply keep moving rather than turning around. Will yield a particular effect and increase the possibility of physical interaction. Thank you. Any mechanical question? I saw a movie today that involves embracing a person's memory and then programming the mind with the memory of another being. And the person took on that identity and became that being. That is only possible with the agreement of the individual. I see, so even if it were possible to facilitate such a thing. There would need the agreement on some level yet. Thank you. Nothing can be done against the will in a sense, so to speak of the higher self. It is impossible. You are your own reality. Therefore, anything that you choose to create as a possibility in that reality is by your concern. And I've been going through a lot of physical changes. Not negative, but just quieter. Again, they are results of certain sensitivity than judgment. Yes, that's why I'm not judging them as such. I'm asking for some advice on how I could facilitate this transformation and obviously don't issue it. Can you provide a specific example? I've been experiencing a lot more in the way of symptoms. At first it was just experiencing very unusual levels of energy. A blade at Titus' chest, that pretty much has... We have to discuss it. Yes, that has passed. There's been pressure on the back of the head, Titus' between shoulder blades. Physical symptoms that you are experiencing. What you may call a stretching of your psychic muscles. Need not perceive it as being a mounting pressure that will explode. Simply again, relate it to physical, if you wish, as an analogy, stretching. That's very novel, isn't it? That's all. Therefore, allow us now to express to you that from our perspective, each and every one of you are part of us. We do not draw the same separation in general as is the tendency of your society. Therefore, in viewing you as equals, we view us as all part of the same whole, the same. One homogenous unbroken consciousness at the same time, manifesting itself in many facets that then interact, that then allow for many, many expansive forms of self-reflection. The idea that is of advantage in separating is the separated portions can now view each other from seemingly an external aspect. So, one again of the other major, shall we say, reasons for separation itself is to then be able to reflect back upon yourself, the many aspects, the many facets that you are. Therefore, again, rather than considering yourself a collection of parts, you can now express the wholeness of your being and understand that they are but mere choices within you. And the more choices that are available, the more variety that you afford yourself within this physical reality. And you seem to like that so much. Therefore, begin to consciously choose to experience the joy of that variety, the joy of those choices, the joy of your ability to choose which is your birthright. We thank you for your continued willingness to dream your life and bid you a most fun and loving. Happy dream.
