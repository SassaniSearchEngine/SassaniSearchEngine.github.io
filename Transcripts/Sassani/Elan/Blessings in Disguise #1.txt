 Greetings this evening of your time, how are you? Oh, thank you very much. Allow me to begin this interaction with the following simplification on some of the ideas that we have shared. Do understand that in communicating with you, very often we will delineate upon mechanics, if you will, specific principles that allow you to understand the way that you create your own reality, and in that sense if you wish, to perform the changes that will allow you to dovetail your reality to one of preference. Therefore, again, in this exploration, in these dialogues and discussions with you, very often, we will go into a, shall we say, degree of detail. For the purposes of this discussion, we will simplify many of the ideas we have shared. For you can understand that when we speak to you about the idea of creating your own reality, that in a sense you can break much of what it is that we discuss down to three simple ideas. Number one will be in your reality, in your life, in the events of your particular experience. You will always first interpret a situation, place an interpretation upon a situation. You will then do to having assumed that interpretation, then create an assumptive premise that you then act upon. You assume a particular attitude based on your particular interpretation. And number three will be the actions that you then perform. Having had that particular attitude from, again, those particular interpretations. So, again, much of what we have shared with you can be simplified down into your interpretation of your reality, your attitude that you assume because of that interpretation, and then your actions that are performed with the premise of that interpretation and attitude. Follow along so far. All right. Now understand, all events in your life, all events have no built-in meaning. They are very literally a set of prompts. If you wish, you can define that your life is the play that you are creating and the events are simply the neutral set of prompts. They, in and of themselves, have no inherent meaning, have no inherent, shall we say, description or purpose. They are simply, again, neutral set of prompts. And you, utilizing the aforementioned approach, interpret these set of prompts, assume an attitude and then act. Therefore, allow us to discuss the idea that many of you still are very willing to interpret the things that you create within your life in negative terms. And then, with the negative interpretation, create, as you say, upset in attitude. You assume the attitude of upset and then when acting, act, out of that interpretation of negativity and attitude of upsetness. So therefore, most obviously, the actions then yield or then support or shall we say, reaffirm and allow you to experience that interpretation as being the only interpretation for that particular event for those particular symbols. But again, we remind you, you choose to interpret in a particular way. And therefore, you always have the choice to, at least also look at the positive interpretation. When we speak about the idea of neutrality, we do not speak of it in terms of leaving your interpretations as neutral. But very often, when individuals have the propensity to label things negative, neutrality is, shall we say, a bit more obtainable than going all the way over to the positive side. So your simple realization that there is no built-in meaning, that a particular event before you that you may be interpreting as negative is simply neutral, can then allow you to look at what is positive about it in a conscious way. And this allows you to begin to incorporate what you label your un or subconscious into your conscious awareness. And it is very simple. Understand, in a sense, you dress the events in your life. You guide them in various apparel, if you will. So therefore, you can understand that if you are interpreting anything whatsoever as negative, that you are disguising, disguising as you have that word, that particular positive meaning from yourself. So therefore allow me now to entitle this interaction, blessing in disguise. For you may now understand that the worst of what still seems to occur in your life is just that, and no less than that. Not a neutral symbol with a high degree of negative propensity that may possibly have some minute positive thing in there to placate yourself. No. You can think of it that way if you wish. But if you wish to be a bit more specific about the impact, about just how much positive is contained within the neutral symbol, you will come to find that there is at least as much positive as negative, for all neutral symbols have 100%, potentiality to express negative or positive depending on your interpretation, attitudes, and actions. So therefore, if you are willing to not only say this is neutral when something seems negative, but in fact go one step further and say, well in fact, this is a blessing, a blessing in this guide. This actually allows me to do something that I could not have done before and begin to look at that approach, that interpretation. You will then, even by being willing to look for the positive interpretation, allow those positive interpretations most blatantly to present themselves. And once you shall we say cut yourself the slack to interpret situations as positive, you then give yourself the opportunity to create a positive, assumption attitude and then the actions that you take with a positive interpretation and assumption attitude, then can only yield with the very same set of props, the very same event, a positive result. That is simple physics, that is simple mechanics. What you put out is what you get back. You sometimes say as you so, so shall you reap, whatever you wish to call it, that is one of the only true laws and creations that transcends all reality. Therefore, if you will be willing from this point forward to utilize what you feel to be the greatest liabilities that are most important in your life, in a positive way, as a blessing in disguise, now willing to undress it of it and perhaps see what undergarments lie in a positive way under that overcoat of negativity you have assigned, you will enable yourself to accelerate most quickly. This is the time of transformation upon your planet. It is most obvious we need not go into that. One of the factors that come along with the degree of transformation that your math consciousness has chosen to participate in is acceleration. That acceleration is also again neutral. You can experience it in a myriad of ways, a plethora of ways. You can experience the acceleration as negative occurrences and experience in your life, but only if and when you determine that you will choose to continue to interpret and assume a negative attitude and perform a negative action. But your mere willingness to even look at what it might be, what the blessing may hold, will enable you to accelerate through, again, what you consider to be the worst of what is left in your life and we remind you, you are finite beings. Though you exist within an infinite universe, you are exploring finiteness. Therefore, what you consider to be the difficulty, what you consider to be the negativity in your life is finite as well. It is not a bottomless barrel, as you say. It has, shall we say, a very shallow bottom. And as you are willing to face, to acknowledge, to look at the negative beliefs within you, that you have denied to this point, that is what will allow you to accelerate the process. And interestingly enough, in your exploration of beginning to now look at events as neutral and begin to assign positive meanings, you will find many things. One of those things will be, again, an acceleration through many old, shall we say, somewhat obsolete, beliefs that you have. The utilization of being willing to label it positive will always bring to the surface, old limiting the beliefs that you no longer prefer, because the idea is that in general, when you are willing, in a situation that is neutral with no built in meaning to label it negative, you are doing so due to a limiting belief that you still hold. And even being willing to begin to see what the positive is, more times than not, will bring that negative belief to the surface. So not only will you get a positive effect, but you will clean out what you sometimes label your subconscious closet. Therefore, blessings are all around you. In fact, you are a blessing. You are a blessing, a blessing spark of the white light of infinite creation itself. Therefore, being that you extend directly from the infinite creator, you cannot help in that sense, but always create. And you get to choose how you create. By only being willing to use everything to your greatest advantage and allow all your creations to be of service to you, can you transform again the stockpile of negative beliefs. And when you do, understand the following. You will no longer ever experience negativity. Again, being in a world where negativity is an option, expansion will also mean being more aware of the negativity that is there. So you very well may be aware of negativity in others, but you absolutely will no longer contain in the equation that you are the ability to experience anything negatively. For whatever you experience, you will simply no longer label as negative. And when you use the creations that seem so easy to label negative in a positive way, you begin to then only generate, shall we say, neutral situations which are a bit more simple to label positive. It is not that you will go relabeling the negatives and fooling yourself throughout your third density existence. No, that is an option, but you do not have to. So understand that the face of your life will literally change once you begin to count your blessings, assemble them, utilize them rather than turn them away, rather than throw them back into the face of infinite creation. It will always be your choice, but the word in your language blessing in general invokes you. A spark, a knowingness. So many times again simply by saying, all right, all right, all right. I understand that the situation seems negative. I understand that if I proceed with the attitude I have right now, it will give a negative result. But I am now remembering that this is a blessing in disguise. Therefore, allow me to look a little bit more closely at it and allow me to perhaps utilize it as just that, a blessing. Therefore, understand that from our perspective, you are all blessings again to us, not necessarily in disguise. And it is our pleasure. We revel in interacting with you in this way. These ideas work for us, and so therefore we can present them to you in a complete fashion for this is how we live. But again, we never insist that there is anything better about what we have to offer, only sensing that you are at the juncture in your explorations where you are requesting this information. Therefore, as with all tools, all tools that you attract in your life, our simple suggestion would be one, do not believe anything that we are saying it, that we are saying because it is us who are saying it. We cannot prove it to you and you can only prove it to yourself. So understand in no uncertain terms that it is not our goal in that sense to change who you are. For we do not judge who you are. We revel in who you are and already feel you to be a blessing. You do not need to achieve blessing nets. No matter what you believe about yourselves, we believe in you utterly. Therefore, allow me now to open up this discussion for exchange for interaction. And again, thank you for your ongoing willingness to begin to look under the disguises that you don and place upon the events of your life, for what you will find always in your search, always in your expansion of your consciousness is more of yourself, for creation occurs not to you, but through and from you. In that light, I ask you now how may I be of service to you. Shitting. Hi. A few weeks ago, I was probably just at fall asleep, maybe a little bit semi-conscious. And I was having a dream that I was at this channel, and Andrew was, I noticed that his eyes were starting to open. So I looked around to see if anyone else noticed and no one seemed to notice. So I even grabbed the woman's arm next to me and she didn't look at me with eyes at all. And then his eyes opened and he noticed that I noticed. And he smiled and at that moment I woke up and what I was, I kind of threw the eyes with something. He emerged into me or I emerged into him and I realized that I was him. And I was awake, totally awake. And saw all kinds of geometric patterns and designs and shapes and colors and lights. And it was accompanied by the very intense vibration that had happened to me before, in and around my body and through my body. And then I fully, consciously, it seemed like I just went up and out through the universe, through the universe. And I was totally conscious. So I wanted to ask you if you could tell me what happened. Hey, and we thank you for your recognition. We thank you for your willingness to begin to expect this symbol directly relates to the experience that you have reached a threshold. And what you will find is immediately an acceleration of your communications with other consciousness. It has to do very, very directly with the idea of assuming responsibility from your end for those interactions and literally walking into the situation eyes open. There is a direct analogy, but the symbol overall will represent the acceleration you are about to embark upon. And our simple suggestion would be to fasten your seat belt. As long as you enjoy roller doers, have a good time. It was interesting because for the first time there wasn't any fear at all, it was just like that is a threshold that we are seeking out for this door so just it has been knocked on before. Now it is being answered and shall we say an invitation is issued from you. We thank you. Thank you. I have another question. I guess regarding that then, I have been doing quite a bit of channeling lately and I wanted to know how quickly or accurately I am matching a khahi style. Exactly perfect for all the individuals that you are interacting with and any nuances that you may synchronistically change or add will happen to be just that which the individual would benefit from hearing most great. So in that sense, you can understand you cannot lose only if you judge them. Therefore, understand that your role is not entirely positive. The symbolism of the eye's open need that you too will directly participate. Therefore trust where your particular overlays come into play. Trust that if you feel a particular way, that is appropriate for that individual and understand that that is what will benefit them. Go with it. Is there something else? Unless there is anything else you can tell me how I could accelerate that process. One thing that may assist you in your meditations, picture yourself as a sphere. Envision your body in the center of the sphere. Understand that your consciousness is the entire sphere, both the surface, the contents and the body. Therefore, you now have a pictorial representation of the fact that your body literally exists within your consciousness and is but one minute point in the center of that consciousness right now. When you feel this, when you sense yourself not with but as the sphere itself, begin to allow your focus to expand from the center point, to begin to open your eyes so to speak within the substance of the sphere rather than only in the center. Perhaps if you wish again, a pictorial analogy, you can close your eyes in the physical center of the sphere and begin to experiment opening them elsewhere from in the sphere. When you do this, the apparent will be that you have quote unquote left your body because from the perspective of your body, you are now locating the eyes of your consciousness external to that one point within the totality of your consciousness. But if you simply begin to play with this idea within the volume of that sphere are other opportunities for communications with other consciousness as well. Therefore, you can say to some degree, you will operate on what you sometimes label more of an ethereal, shall we say, presentation, astral to some degree, but even more ethereal than that, the more you allow yourself to expand out toward the perimeter of the sphere. Is that clear? I'll have to listen to it again, but clear enough, I think. Oh, again, it simply has to do with shifting your focus within your consciousness. And this will, in a sense, lead you on a journey. We will stop it. Okay, thank you. And to you very much. Hi, Ellen. Great news. I have had a wonderful week. I talked to you last night and hi, Janisha came to be with me in my room and that was marvelous because I wanted to share with you that I absolutely felt them loving me deeper than I ever had before. So well, the idea is they have loved you that deeply the whole time. You are now beginning to access the depth of that love. And being that that love is unconditional. This means you cannot lose it. And again, you are in a reality where, shall we say, very often individuals choose to love conditionally. So the quality of that unconditional love can, at first, perhaps seem to be overwhelming, but individuals seem to get used to it quite quickly. Yeah, I will. I am. Also, I wanted to share my experience of last Sunday night meditating with Joan. And it was, I'm sure you're aware of that. I was experiencing the gathering of all my assets of me and gathering into this focus this now moment. All of their knowing for this transformation this second, this now. Well, how excited? What does that allow you to discover about yourself and then how can you apply it in your reality? I just covered infinite things. I can't talk about the moment. More perhaps you will simply discuss the final one. I have a couple which are exciting to me. One was that I discovered the real meaning of what you put out is what you get back. Oh, the real meaning? Oh, what? For me. For me. I have previously interpreted that as what you put out is what you will get back. Not necessarily, literally, directly, but we understand. So I got that it is this moment that I get back. Is this now? It's not out in the future. So that was very important for me to realize. And when you are willing to begin to define and live within your excitement, you literally create less time. Literally. I know. Or there is even literally far less of a lag between the doing of the thing and the having of the results, so to speak. Part of the lag that many individuals create in the having of a concept and then manifesting it, the intervening time that they create in between is intervening time spent doing things that are not representative of who you are. And the more that you divert from your purpose, the more details you add to your existence. The more details that you add to your existence within a life that contains the idea of time, the more time you then need to have created to access the details. So when you begin to be willing to be in touch with who you are and not ever in any given situation settled for less, you literally create less time and again, your expression time flies by fast while you are having fun simply means you create less time, for you create less details that you must attend. Does that make sense? Absolutely, yeah. So your innocence, grieving can be quite quickly realized after the sewing. But what you are discussing is simultaneous. Now moment, sewing and grieving. Yes. It was the same, during the same experience I had, you talked about the future, about the being focusing in the center of the fear and then focusing elsewhere and being there. And like quantum leaping kind of thing. That can be the eternity but you literally do not travel. You simply, shall we say, remove yourself from one particular definition of location, reinsert yourself in the other definition of location as you open and close your eyes from one portion of your consciousness to the other. So yes, from your timeline mentality this can seem like a quantum jump. And that felt like that was part of the action of what I put out is what I get back. Also in the pyramid, well in the place where I love during the presentation, I called out to my ethics and asked all to be present and all to kind of fold into me now. And it seemed like there was about 20 to 30, so I am not sure how many there were but there were beings from all over but I remember distinctly hearing them laughing and then all of them laughing and then I felt... I'm rolling in the eye. I felt exactly what they were feeling. I had the access to your consciousness, all that consciousness. You are beginning in that sense to understand the term we refer to as tail empathy and understand you are quite popular amongst the children of our planet. Great. Well I invite all of them to be with me at any time. All invitation connected. And we hug you. Shh! Come on. Hey! I want to ask you a little more about belief systems. We have a personal belief and there is also a massive read upon belief. Hey! Can you talk a little bit about how these two interact and do they override each other at times? Well in a sense you always create your own reality. When you choose to participate in a reality with so to speak other consciousness, there are shall we say certain agreements that are established that allow the laying down of the physical foundation of the reality in physical reality. So therefore when you begin to explore this particular life, this particular existence, these agreements shall we say are the framework that are in place. But again as we have shared, the only law of creation is what you put out is what you get back. You exist. All is one. These are absolutes. But the law, what you put out is what you get back. If what you put out is in tandem with the math agreed upon belief, then what you get back will be that experience. If on the other hand you are willing to, shall we say, walk on the edge, begin to explore, deviating or perhaps temporary suspension of the math agreed upon belief, you will put out that vibration and get back that effect. One of the things we often share at this point however is that many individuals very strongly buy into these agreements. And in fact they utilize these agreements as signposts to define that their reality is still holding together. So therefore there will generally be a certain percentage of individuals unwilling to deviate from that arrangement. They therefore, if you do, will not be likely to perceive you getting the experience that deviates from the math agreement, where they have not chosen to agree to experience a suspension of the agreement. So you can experience those suspensions. Individuals who also are exploring such an idea can experience them with you as well. But other individuals who again may very strongly invest in them and in fact rely on them for sense themselves will be unlikely to perceive what you are experienced. Can they also find that disturbing to have other people kind of go against the grain like that? Yes, and very often what they will do is rationalize within their particular belief systems, keeping in step with the math agreed upon, beliefs they will rationalize some way that that occurs fits into their belief system in a sense usually not believe it occurred. So is there any particular, well two questions, is there ways that we can really strengthen our own personal beliefs or make changes in them? And how can we not be at the influence of somebody's math agreed upon beliefs that are limiting to our personal beliefs? Simple choice. Now that you understand what we are discussing, you are now outside of the mechanism we are discussing. You can only speak of these ideas when you are outside of them. When you are outside of them, you are now writing the play. You make the rules. You get to decide. Simply by establishing in every given moment your preference, allowing yourself to align toward any particular event that presents in space to you allows you to see what beliefs you hold and you can then choose to strengthen and act upon the ones you wish to have. And simply again reinterpret, have a different root assumption and different actions about the ones you wish to change very much of what we have shared at the beginning of this interaction. In terms of the math agreed upon beliefs, you are already beginning to explore deviating from them and what you label your fire walking. Is this not correct? Yes. So therefore, this is the most obvious path of least resistance for you to witness this idea, but this opens you up to understand that these beliefs can be suspended and you can simply decide which other particular beliefs you may wish to experiment with. One of the examples I was most concerned about is a lot of the media coverage on things like AIDS, which is very negative. I don't think I would understand that it is both. There is positive, there is negative and you can attract either, but it is not only negative. That is not accurate. Right. Well, I know that. But I mean, I don't experience it that way, but I'm thinking a lot. I see a lot of other people being influenced by a lot of that media. Well, again, it will always be their choice to buy into it or not buy into it and how you can be of service is by providing alternatives. Buy, if you have a particular perspective that is empowering in any way that your imagination conjures up, sharing that idea. Do not keep it to yourself. It does not assist others unless you share it. So put it out there. The other thing, I had a similar thing happen to this lady here where I was sort of in semi-conscious state. And this ties into the ongoing conversation we've had about the future counterparts in the Japanese connection where I saw myself in a, I believe it was the past life, ancient times in Japan dealing with martial arts and having some kind of body work. And I immediately started to slip out of my body at that point. And I knew that it tied into, I was starting to get information about these other connections to Japan that you said I would probably start experiencing. Can you tell me any more about that? You are in progress. You are doing it. And in fact, that exercise, the sphere of exercise would be, shall we say, applicable to anyone who is excited by it. And there are a few others who have had similar experiences present as well. But for now, we will not box you in to particular labels and allow you to explore freely. One last thing, I wanted to know something about the energy of birds. Generally speaking, the energy of birds is symbolic meaning for birds, but all more specifically for me because as a child I always had parrots as pets. And I had strong connections with birds even recently, especially of the parrot family of Malakian cockati that I had a very strong connection with. Can you talk a little bit about that personally and generally the energy of birds? In a case, personally and generally for you, the idea is of the freedom of the soaring through, shall we say, your reality in a positive way. Also understand they represent the fact that your atmosphere in and of itself is not the empty atmosphere, you assume it to be. In fact, it is a sea in a sense to them. So therefore they swim through that slightly more etheric sea in that sense. Many, many, many symbols arise for the bird and we will again let you begin to explore the ones that are most relative to you. But for now, what will be most relevant is the idea of beginning to free yourself up and being willing, as you have even literally most recently done, jump dive into your reality, soar into your reality with no hesitation. No, shall we say misplaced trust and doubt, birds cannot fly if they think about it. They simply do it. They simply are the idea of it. Are you referring to the bungee jumping that I did or? In that one instance, yeah. Someone of an extreme example, but it was a... Shall we say, it does not exist upon our planet. We derive enough joy from watching you enjoy it. So dive into your reality. Do not hesitate. Spread your wings and soar. And show your... Shut it down. It is. Good evening. Good evening. I have a number of questions. Last night I went to another woman in my own area where I lived in Southbury who is channeling on her property where at that time, this whole week, there are increasing of vortex around the property. They being others, viewing the use of the association. I would live in a whole part of the association. And last night we felt, and I felt, I mean, I felt definitely an acceleration of my consciousness. But very, the physical acceleration occurring upon your planet as well. Do proceed. Well, last night, what happened was, very interesting, and I totally validated it, was that we were all in the house. There was only three of us in the house, the woman and the other woman in the cell. And everything got very quiet. It was a very stormy night, but all of a sudden things were quiet. And usually there's an airport, like a few miles away, usually here in the jets and stuff going by. And we all thought the same thoughts at the same time that they recreated the house on board their ship. And as we all came up with that, and more of us, and the other woman seemed to be very tuned into this, that we were on the ship, but we were not to see the ship itself, that we were sitting in the house in the room of a recreation simulation of the home on the ship. Which was quite interesting, but beyond the physical sense that we were there, they were in the room of taking notes. That's what we were called. They were taking notes of... In a sense. Is this also, could you explain a little bit about last night in terms of more than what I'm going into? It is not too dissimilar from the energy field trip that we took onto the mothercraft. It is simply an energy representational journey. It was, shall we say, real, but will always be up to you to decide to validate it or not. Oh, this is so pretty new. This is so real that one of the things that happened, and never happened to me before, is my arm. I thought it was getting very hot at one point in my elbow, and I couldn't figure out why it was happening. It felt like there was an invisible being shooting into my elbow, and then my forehead, my third eye, felt like there was something... I'm using the word attached for, you know, not using a better word, attached to right here, in the middle of my forehead. Oh, right, understand you were experiencing various energy levels? No, shall we say, beings inhabited your body. And in that sense, the energies that flowed through you, in that sense, were resistant in the area you labeled your elbow. So the heat you felt was the friction of that resistance, before the most part you were opened, and allowed a flow. Why did my elbow resist? You tell me? You can't. I'll have to work on that one. Oh, why do you not have to work on that? Another thing is, I've also felt recently in my house that I have my feelings usually when I go with all the time. I sometimes later now be sitting downstairs watching TV a little bit, just to say it restless or whatever, and I'll sit there for a while and relax. And also I feel it's a warm room, but I also feel like coldness. That will generally represent other consciousness in proximity, physical proximity to you. Yes, I understand that completely. And it's been happening a lot lately. Well, are you going to pick up the phone? We'll allow it to continue to ring and be cold. No, I'm going to pick up the phone. Oh, where? I've shared that you can use the literal symbol in your imagination of a phone ringing. You're self walking over, picking it up, and allow yourself to see what occurs, or hear what occurred later. The other thing I had is that at this time there's a woman who's channeling, and it was as tarred, seen if I'm correct in the conversation. There are several, shall we say, representatives of that stream do proceed. Well, she's in New York, and through this magazine, of all the transcriptions, I read this little transcription, which was short, that she had channeled. God in touch with her, more than just a little time out, that she was in New York. And it seems like I'm going to bring her to Connecticut in a couple of weeks, and also their ships, some of their ships, are already in New York. Now, why they would have to be there when she's channeling, and I'm not understanding of that in terms of the logistics of how that works. I mean, as she's channeling, the Aztar command people, their ships have to be in proximity to near where the channeling is. And not necessarily, though we suggest you ask her the reason. Okay. Obviously, we are an example of a ship that does not, being that we are not only approximately where you go over way, our dimension upon yours, 500 light years. But we are also, in another, shall we say, frequency dimensional together. So therefore, proximity is not necessarily a factor, and this is one of the reasons that we prefer to utilize consciousness, biological consciousness, for these interactions. For it is the most, shall we say, sensitive, transceiver that we know of. I wanted to talk about, I was going with the King of Hanukkah, what was your question, but Jesus Christ, there is, last night I was asked for Henry other who does the channeling of the energies, that she's with. Jesus Christ, before the turn of the century, on her property, where there's a, in fact, of her property, there's a null. Where there's no waterfall at this moment, that there will be a beautiful waterfall where people come from all over the world too. And Jesus Christ will appear physically, and he will not disappear. And can you go ahead a little bit? It is not our job. Yes, I understand. The individuals that you are interacting with, we refer you to them. And finally, this is, I have no remember if I spoke about this before, I don't think I have, but when a person has half the soul somewhere else in the universe, and the other half here, is that pretty fairly common? Do you understand that from our perspective this is incorrectly phrased? You, in that sense, are one complete over soul. That over soul expresses itself as many aspects from its perspective simultaneously. From your particular perspective, you are the one manifestation of it now, having had quote unquote in the past, others, and real happiness. And real have others in the future. You are simply taking the simultaneous oneness, and shall we say unrolling it along the timeline. So therefore, you are always simultaneously being represented in an infinite number of realities. Is there some specific reference that you are searching for? Well, actually yes, because my understanding is, I know there are entities. My key is, I think this brings, the high priest of Jupiter, and at the same time, I am spontaneous with each other, which is something only new for me to understand. Well, not really, we have discussed it before that all your lives exist right now. You are simply choosing to assume a particular focus that seems to exclude all of them, but this one. Understand that the references that you are bringing up are references to energies that exist, but not in your dimension. There is not physically, literally, a physical council upon your planet of Jupiter in this particular dimension of experience. There are however, shall we say occupations of every planetary body in some dimension of experience. In some of those other dimensions, your particular planet Earth, third planet from your central star, is barren. So therefore, there are many, many, many overlapping, overlaying, probable other realities whereby there are an habitations of planetary bodies that do not exist in your dimension. This, what you are speaking about is simply a reference to one of them, and again, it as well as all your past lives and future lives exist simultaneously from the perspective of your over soul. But from the perspective you are exploring along a timeline, there is the transparency that some have occurred in the past, some will occur in the future, some are happening at the same time, and perhaps you are speaking of one of the ideas at the same time. Counter part consciousness. That's exactly what I'm speaking of. In general, that does refer to in the same civilization, however, so it is only roughly translated in that way. It is more one of your extra dimensional representations. I want to get into names. Basically, what I'm reasoning on, it just seems to be something that's coming from my consciousness. Beyond the names that we all have here on Earth, currently what we were born with, our current names, are there other names that we go by? Can be, it depends, you must understand. Not all of the experiences, not all of the options of explorations contain the idea of language, or in that fact, physicality at all, so it is rather arbitrary, but you can say perhaps, in some sense, that there are certain vibratory signatures that would describe the overall vibration of your soul itself, but perhaps they will not always be translatable into any particular reality. Alright, if I wanted to be on the name I already have, would there be another name I can use beyond this name? Does one occur to you? It will be a past the moment. Alright, when it does try it off, see how it feels, perhaps ask a friend, call me this for the day. Ask me no questions, simply call me this for the day. See how it feels, try it. It will be obvious. Final question about clouds. I take an interesting cloud, but I bought a book that has beautiful pictures of clouds in relation to all of the birds going through the transformation of the clouds. And these clouds are clouds that evidently use the term IOS using loosely ships in clouds, can you expand upon this? Do you mean craft of skewered by clouds? Right. It does occur sometimes, it is rather rare. Okay, I don't know. In other words, there is simply no reason to need to conceal. Devices are able to sense particular ideas upon the planet without needing to be in proximity. And if it is desired that particular individual see a particular craft, the individuals will attract themselves to a particular place where it is simply conducive to show the face. There is truly not necessarily the reason or the need to hide behind clouds. Right, and so therefore these crafts that do hide, why won't these term hide that are behind clouds? What is the, now they are all within the density or within the dimensional reality that people can visually see them? Sometimes. Sometimes. When they are very often and again, this is quite rare. It will simply be a matter of an elaborate game of hide and seek. But it is not a game of hide and seek between the observer and the craft. It is a game of hide and seek between the observer's perception of what they will allow themselves to proceed that perhaps is not in tandem with the mass agreed upon beliefs. All right, I'll stop today. I'll come hungry some other thoughts in my mind now. Oh, thank you. Good luck. Good luck. See you next. Seeing that there are no accidents, usually it's significant the upside down craft on the surface. Oh, we thank you for asking. Do understand, upon spacecraft, particularly spacecraft that is interacting with your society at this time, there is within the craft in and of itself perhaps you can stay set up, an artificial gravity field. This means that no matter what the orientation of the craft is to the planet itself, to the inhabitants of the craft, the floor always feels down. And in that sense, the feeling always feels up. So understand that it is only upside down from your perspective. Also understand that nothing is a strength that as well is a blessing in the sky. That was it. It takes all time. Oh yes. That is the idea. That is what all that is is being all kind. Will that do? Yes. Thank you. And we thank you. Male. Hi. When we spoke a month ago in this room, I gave myself the choice, essentially, of anger or ecstasy. And I sort of waffled. Oh, I chose both. I wasn't quite willing to let go of anger. As a result of that decision, I ran into a lot of angry people over the next couple of weeks. Well, how convenient. In some form of automatic mirror. Nearly lost my life as a result of angry people. Where would you have lost it to? Well, just enough. Oh. Translating. Okay, translating. And I found myself opening my eyes to the fact that I was living in kind of a nest of angry people. And now we will assume you do not mean the individual's present. No. Oh, no. We have individuals who have a lot of unresolved angry feelings and propensities. Oh, that we can be able to allow yourself to see what you look like. Well, that's right. I had many, many, many years. And I assume, into the point of saying, well, all right, I have enough of being angry totally enough. I now choose ecstasy. I wholeheartedly choose ecstasy. We thank you. All right. We also remind you. It is not uncommon in this reality for individuals to define themselves, establish their preference, by giving themselves so many examples of the things they do not prefer and simply performing the process as you say of elimination. This is not necessary, but it is one way. Yes. Yes. But, you know, part of my ongoing interest and exploration of what the dynamics of negativity, I came to an interesting discovery as well. In a sense, you understand again that it is the dynamics of interpreting situations as negative. Exactly. Yes. Yes. You know, I felt in the case of this particular incident, at the very time I waffled a month ago on anger versus ecstasy, I could feel myself saying to myself, well, I must be a bit retarded. You want it to have anger still, you know? Okay. When I had enough, finally, anger, I... Then you keep some judgment upon yourself. That I well rounded. Well, I saw that I had judgment on the matter of anger. And then I looked for another interpretation, more positive interpretation, of wanting to have both anger and ecstasy. And I came off with a point out of nowhere that this was a natural, inevitable impulse of divine entity to embrace all realities. So I wasn't a bit of a cool afterlaw, I was simply being blind. Oh, you used even that? All right. You can use even the judgment, but understand, in general, people will create a paralysis by continuing to judge themselves for having judged. So the first step to begin to, shall we say, break, so to speak, that final is the idea of allowing yourself to even judge. And then using even the judgment by determining what must I believe to be judging this particular event, idea, relationship, person, as less than anything else in creation. I now understand that everything in creation is equal. So what must I believe about myself, that I would assign or feel the need to assign something a lesser value? Therefore, you can now use that judgment for the beliefs that you will find will always be very limiting, self-awareness in beliefs, and upon transforming them will begin to allow the positive acceleration. Oh, absolutely. What did you find? Well, now I'm looking at every incident involving anger slash judgments as a very interesting opportunity for me to see, spot my underlying beliefs and then to alter how transform them along more preferred lines. We thank you. Well, all right. And thank you for the ongoingness of the investigations and discoveries. We thank you in particular for being willing to not only roll these ideas around, share them with many people, but to begin to institute them, to act upon them in your life. When we say we cannot prove it to you, but we guarantee 100% it works, the only way for you to find that out is to do it. You are beginning to do so. And we'll find also the face of your life, as it already has, to begin to change as well. And we thank you. Thank you. Over there. Mayo. Hi. Following up on both Kenny's and Ted's questions of... Are you... Are you waffling too? I'm not waffling too. I don't understand. Are you serious? Are there shifts that appear to be made of cloud substance? Though they look like a craft. This is a bit different. You may understand, if you are not speaking literally of clouds, that there are a variety of fields that are created around crafts that allow them, in that sense, to remove and reinsert themselves, so to speak, into various reality. The appearance of these particular isolation fields can sometimes be perceived as individuals or interpreted, though they do not present exactly in this way, as a darker gray type of cloud. But in general, they do not hang around very often. Or shall we say, for too long? There are sometimes there's a very white cloud. In general, no, but there are some exceptions. Right. Now, when the craft running decided by Carne, Kansas, they appeared as clouds. And as the clouds... The clouds seem to resort into, if you will, and resolve into the shape of the Delta crafts. In the sense, you may understand that the field, in a sense, was disengaged. That will be the appearance. Now, when they disappeared, they did not disappear into a cloud. They just winked out of existence. Can you explain the mechanics of that? In a sense, it was a demonstration for your benefit. Shall we say the field was in full force by definition, it must be, but it was, shall we say, imperceptible at that time? Not visible to me. There is, shall we say, the ability from within the craft for various faces to be presented. Okay. I have another question along the lines of your introductory talk. Oftentimes, people express a reluctance or an inability to believe that light can be so smoothly that you have what it is you prefer and that you can create your own reality. Yes, that is their right to explore that idea. So therefore, that idea will be as easy to buy into as all others. I understand. There seems to be an underlying belief that if one's life were to reach a state, quote, of perfection, it would be bored. So not even if they were before, that they might go out of existence. Oh, why? What is the, shall we say, rational for this, or does not on the surface make that much sense to us? What would be the purpose of fulfilling your purpose, being the year you decided to be, and then upon full realization of this being went down? There seems to be the underlying belief that light itself has a specific purpose once obtained or attained your life ends. Well, in a sense, you can say that you then transform, for you no longer have the need for those symbols, but you are not weak out. I understand. What my question is, is this a belief that's shared by many cultures, and what's, you know, could you talk a little bit about that? It is a belief that exists throughout, shall we say, the multiverse, not in, perhaps you can say, many, many cultures. It is within cultures that are exploring particular styles of limited physicality, but again, it is not law simply choice. It's simply a misapplication or misunderstanding of the idea of what you put out is what you get back. Elron Hubbard describes reality as the individual creates reality, and then in order to cause that reality to persist, lies about who created it, and it's the lie that holds it together. That is not our perspective. That is one perspective, that is a valid perspective. It is not our perspective. Is it of Orion, or is it? Very literally, yes. Thank you very much. And to... Shelly. Elron. Hey. I have a question or so about the Crystal Skulls. Hey. A couple of months ago, you suggested to me that I try to find one? If it excites you, yes. It does. That was new to me in that moment, but yes. So, since that's... I'd like people to know that the woman and a Mitchell Hedges will be in the United States. The one incident that I know about will be in August at a place near Buffalo, New York, where she'll be talking, giving a talk and video presentation. And then I presume that the skull will be, during these times, available to people to interact with. And it occurs to me that I would like to do that. That there would be some other preparation than what I've done so far. Need not be something you go out of your way to do. By simply utilizing what we have shared, in fact, this evening, and utilizing, perhaps, things that you choose to still label negative to begin to acknowledge beliefs that you have and transform them, our only suggestion in dealing with that particular energy is to be very clear with yourself. Be very clear to who you are. If there are particular fears that exist within you, drum them up, dive into them. Feel them. Allow them to give their messages. Allow them to transform. Then, in that sense, when you stare straight into the eyes, there will be a literal downloading of information. Perhaps you can say, from your higher self, through the conduit of that particular symbol, and there will be many revelations. By staring into the eyes of that particular symbol. Okay. Thank you. And also, I'd like to thank you, because I am able to be in contact because of your suggestion a woman referred me to someone who's in contact with and a Mitchell Hedges, and also someone through your group who sent the notice of where this woman was going to be. We thank you for your actions, for all the suggestions, meaning little. The actions taken, all the suggestions that create the reality. Therefore, we thank you. Right now, I'm conceiving and planning some of the trips that I intend to lead to the Yupa 10. Oh, how exciting. Yeah. I just finished some of them just a few hours ago, as a matter of fact. In fact, I'm so excited. I really can't wait to go. I think they're really good. It occurs to me that there is a larger context for this interest in the knowledge of the Maya's. My intent is to bring people in contact with this, and that some of this knowledge enter the... are contemporary lives, even though these people lived some time ago. And it occurs to me that there might be a larger context or a larger picture for this. Can you comment upon that? We simply refer you to the literature that already exists upon your planet regarding the Maya's factor. And also, again, explain that when you stare into the eyes, some of the downloading of information will be in regards to the nature of that civilization. Since, perhaps you can say at least most recently, that symbol emerged from that culture. Therefore, it is encoded within that symbol. Hmm. And so, when that happens, then I will understand a little more the purpose of the skull and... It will be as I direct communication, stare into the eyes, into the eyes. Okay. Here's... Looking at you. I have one last question I'd like to ask at this time. And, here are some meditations I've been doing recently. I've gotten a lot of information, and one small bit is intriguing to me. I was asking about to be given a name and a certain context of a certain life that has to do with Native Americans. And then I was given this name Edward or Edwin Thompson. And I'm wondering if... And this turns out to be a person who owned the Hoxian to which is your Chichen Itza in the Yucatan. Can you... do you perceive a particular relationship that I may have or had had with the person of that name? A connection, certain information to be invited. Get in touch. That person lived, I think in the early 1900s. Oh, why? Get in touch. Oh, alright. I started that process. There's some quotes by that person in a book I just ordered from the library. Oh, why? You realize the path of least resistance? What is already there? Use that, then you will expand. Okay. Thank you very much. And to you. At this timing, we will pause for a short break of 10 to 15 minutes of your counting and resume contact at that timing.
