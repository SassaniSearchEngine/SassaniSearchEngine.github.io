 We will begin this interaction this evening of your time with the entitlement. Just say no thank you. The idea is as follows. From our perspective, the ultimate truth is composed of all truth. For it to ultimately be the truth you can leave nothing out. All truths are true within the framework of those who hold them. The framework of those who buy into those particular beliefs. And though a belief system, a truth that you may hold, would seem on the surface to exclude the belief system or truth of another. It only does so from your perspective. From the perspective of the ultimate truth, it is all truth. And it is not this or that it is both this and that both. We understand that at first this may seem a little strange. You see over here as well if it's this, it can't be that. Everybody knows that. But the idea is that the individuals who believe that say the same thing about you. And they are no less correct in the overall ultimate sense than are you. This does not mean that particular truths are less and more positive or more negative or less negative. But the idea is that all truths, all belief systems have validity. They are all indeed explorations, valid explorations. They may be explorations of positivity, integration. They may as well be explorations of negativity and separation. However, they all hold equal validity. This does not mean you need condone a particularly negative viewpoint. But what we are sharing is that all viewpoints are equally valid. The advantage to beginning to realize this and apply it is that as you are willing to equalize all truths in validity, you then give yourself a more equal choice, a more equal access to all truths and therefore can begin to determine which truths you do prefer and begin to hold them, apply them and therefore manifest them, get what you want in that sense from that truth. But paradoxically, by invalidating another truth or another choice, you give the thing that you say you are invalidating more weight, you hold it in place, you place attention upon it and this giving or assigning more weight actually makes you more likely to choose the very thing you say you don't prefer. Now by being willing to even think that there may be some validity in all ideas, all truths, perhaps that will then give you the open attitude to begin to see how they are valid. Now it is not that you need necessarily see how every little thing is valid in terms of its relationship to you. You will have more of a relative degree of significance to some ideas than another. But even those that are not relevant to you still from the overall sense of all that is, what have validity. This brings up the notion of learning in that sense to interact with individuals who hold different beliefs than you and still maintaining positive integration from your standpoint, still being within your integrity. Or the question comes up from time to time. Well, if someone offers me something that I do not prefer, how do I communicate in an integrated way to that individual without invalidating them? Perhaps the issue polarizes you so much that it would be your tendency immediately to scream at the individual. Needless to say, this is not exactly a primary form of validation. So the idea is very, very simple. You have within your language certain ideas, certain wording that allow you to express yourself and at the same time maintain a certain civil tone, a certain politeness in a sense. And they are simply, no thank you. Thanks but no thanks. No thank you in and of itself says two things. It says this is not me. I do not prefer it however. Thank you. I validate it. I can picture in some sense how perhaps that serves you and I thank you for your willingness to present this gift to me. And when you will look at what individuals have to offer as gifts rather than in position, you give yourself at least an opportunity to glean something from it in positive service. When you say, oh shut up, idiot. You do not allow yourself to glean anything. You shut the very door. We purposely use that wording for, put it this way, we've heard it before, upon your promise. Not to invalidate it either, but to point out that perhaps that will not get you what it is you say you desire. And what we wish to share with your society is the idea that you can establish your preference and manifest it. In other words, get what you want. But again, paradoxically, not by invalidating what you don't want. And your willingness to validate what you don't want as being equal, though not at all, preferential gives you the equal access to the thing you say you desire. And analogy we have used we will share again. Loosely speaking, we have labeled it, that's their story. Individual comes along, espouses to you a particular viewpoint. If you will simply say that's their story, then that allows you to glean what pages from their story fit into your book. And if no pages fit into your book, or if only a few actually fit, you need love their story no less. It is still just that, their story, valid story. This is my story, this is their story. But when you begin to have an open attitude and begin to recognize that you do by being the vibration of who you are, attract anything that you interact with for some reason, you can begin to look with more open eyes at what pages of their book help to fatten up your own book. And the idea is you will find more often than not, that even with individuals who seem to have quote unquote nothing to offer, which by the way is impossible. You will see that there may just be a little nuance, but there is something within it that you can use, perhaps a footnote. But the idea is something that can be applicable within your story. We have discussed the idea that you are all a particular vibration. The vibration that you are is set up by your beliefs, emotions, thoughts and ultimately your actions. You can only experience a reality that you are the vibration of. Therefore anything you attract, anything, if you will begin to look at it this way, is attracted to you due to the vibration you have become. Now often this allows you to see very many things about the vibration you have created that you do not prefer and perhaps wish to change. But when you will begin to look at it this way, you will give yourself the opportunity to begin to hone in on the things that you may wish to change, the beliefs that you are holding that no longer serve you. But by labeling something, someone or any event as extraneous, not belonging there, how did you get in there? You do not give yourself any receptive attitude and shut down any ability to glean anything from it. So you may, if you wish, we will not force you. Begin to recognize that if you use any portion of what it is you have attracted, you are now beginning to be a conscious creator of your reality. You are beginning to take back total responsibility for everything that you've created. And again, you define yourself in many ways. One way is to give yourself so many examples of the things you prefer to reinforce who it is you are, what it is you prefer. Another way, just as valid, is to give yourself so many examples of that which you do not prefer. And you do not have to do it that way. By using the things that you've attracted, that you think on the surface you do not prefer, gleaning something from them, you will allow the remnants of the creations that you have drawn to yourself, perhaps unconsciously, to deliver their message. And when symbols deliver a message, they do not hang around, they transform. Therefore, you need not agree with anybody's viewpoint. You may find that if you will be a bit empathic, you may agree with more than you had thought. But the idea is that it is of service to you. Everything allows you to define yourself still further. What you do prefer is an indication to you of who you are. But what you do not prefer is just as much an indication to you of who you are. Therefore they are of equal service. And you can begin, in that sense, by validating the things you don't prefer to transform their effects upon you out of your life altogether. So as you expand, you will still see more of everything, more of what you prefer, more of what you do not prefer. You will see this, you will be aware of it. This is what the expansion of awareness means. But you need not experience, personally, experience in your world, in your universe, in your reality, the things you say you do not prefer. The first step toward doing so is to validate the things you don't prefer. Green from them what you can. Assume that you have attracted them for a reason, thereby giving yourself the opportunity to begin to search for what the reason is. Nothing slips in there. Everything that exists exists and there are no pointless or extraneous creations. Not even you. Everything belongs. Therefore everything is usable. And as you are more willing to use what you've already created and begin to consciously have an intention about what it is you wish to continue to create, you transform out of your immediate experience the things you do not prefer, and only then experience that which you do once you have, shall we say, given it a go for a while. You live within a universe that part of the definition is time, and perhaps there will be a little bit of time in between the conception of thinking this way, beginning to act this way, and beginning to, as you say, reap the benefits of such an action. So therefore, when someone comes along and says something you do not prefer, just say, no thank you. I love your story no less. Thank you for presenting the gift that you did. I will use part of it. Please do not be offended if I do not use the rest. Also, when you are offering who you are to someone else, if you truly believe in the idea that you are espousing, you need not convince any one of it. If you truly believe in the power of your ideas, they stand alone on their own. If you find yourself convincing someone of a particular reality that from your perspective is the only way, then in that sense you are not realizing this idea. You are not believing in the power of your own idea, and the bottom line is the person that you are really trying to convince is yourself. If you truly believe in the power of your ideas, they are simply gifts. Period. And you do not, at least from our perspective, and having observed your society, cram your Christmas gifts down each other's throats. You simply offer them with the idea that it will be something that is appreciated. If not, this is why you saved the receipt. The idea is, however, that you do not give a gift insisting that someone must take it. Therefore, when someone else offers you a gift, be willing to look at the portions of the gift that enhance who you are. When you share who you are with another, that is the most that you can do, and that is the most responsible you can be. And listen to the wording, to, not for, to another individual, for you all create your own reality, all of you. So therefore, you can only really be responsible for yourself. You cannot be responsible for someone else, but you can be responsible to them. And by being responsible for yourself, this means giving them the truest reflection of who you are. Not who it is you think they want to hear. Not saying what it is you think they wish to hear. When you do that, you are not giving the gift of who you are. And in effect, what you are allowing to occur, when you say something that you think someone else wants to hear, that is not reflective of your true beliefs, all you are doing is allowing them to have a very elaborate conversation with themselves. And this in a sense does not provide them the greatest opportunity for growth. Your perspective being different and unique without saying that they need to take it is the greatest opportunity for growth that you can give another. Whether or not they accept it, if they accept it, then they will grow from the ideas of expansion that you have shared. If they do not, they have also grown, for they have reasserted to themselves who they are. Therefore, allow us now to share with you all your perspectives as well as ours. We find the ultimate enrichment in our reality is the gift that you all have to share. Now it is not that many of the ideas that you share are always things that we would necessarily use, but we do not invalidate any of them, any of them. And you can do the same. Otherwise we would not be able to interact with you. And upon interacting with you, you simply would not hear a word that is being said. So take for granted that if you can hear this and understand it on any level, you contain it as well. And anything you see in us as a sparkling example is merely a shiny mirror. And what you are looking at that you love in us or any external symbol is what is already within you. Therefore we thank you for the light that you emanate. We thank you for the varying packages of your gifts. We validate your gifts and we enjoy sharing with you. For the gift of your willingness to interact with us as an equal, we again thank you for your willingness to act as ambassadors literally from your civilization and allowing us to act as ambassadors for our respective civilizations. I ask you now how may we be of service to you? Sharon, mail. Then she named. I would like to share a story I wrote back in 79 when I was in college and it was called it was about alternative futures and you're sharing so many things on equal level with us. I think that's the best question I would share a story. Oh right. And it's called an artistic a place and time and space. Oh right. Please present the condensed version. Oh my gosh. Well it's only four pages. I can read it very quickly. Oh. It is the year 2000 and a new advanced society has emerged on the planet Earth. Twenty two years ago on the year 1979 government, military leaders, police and other rules of the Earth were destroyed by great social upheaval throughout the world. Revolution continued from 1979 until 1982 when all the planets lined up with each other in the solar system. One day the revolution stopped. A great transformation was occurring. A planet that had seen great destruction of nature, the air, water and animal and rain life was recovered. The use of atomic weapons on Earth that killed millions of people. Now things have completely changed from 1979 to 1982. Between 1982 and the year 2000 we went into the dark ages. Nobody knows exactly what occurred during this time except that by the year 2000 the Earth became beautiful as it once had been millions of years ago before there was war and hate and distrust. We're going to look at the society of animals, humans and marine life that now live harmoniously with one another and find out just what is going on. This civilization calls itself Aniska. The new Atlantis with metropuses and modern forms in the countryside. Aniska has become the Earth's most advanced civilization since Atlantis were peaceful and appropriate technology. No police, corporations, military or centralized government as their predecessors believed in twenty years ago. Aniska, a metropolis that looks like no other ever built in history. The political aspects of Aniska are not, anarchism is a form of governing incorporated into the cities and countryside. Decisions are made each by each community and in and out of the city. In the past these same people were governed for the central system which was composed of mostly men who belonged to the corporate system and had money twenty years ago. But a lot has happened since then. The money system has been disbanded. Money no longer is this one for filling the needs of an exchange cooperative has been developed where everyone is provided for whatever is needed in their community. This has eliminated the need for banks which control the large amount of money back in 1979. This towards chaos people have no where to sleep food tea or liberties the elite had been. Now people can eat well and have a place to sleep and have liberties which they never had before. The metropuses are filled with life, people smile and welcome new departments to the city with open arms. The clothing and the warmer climates of the cities does not have to be worn. New Atlantean is worn from the tropics without any problem they are nice. Many of the buildings look like ancient pyramids and are very advanced and special design. Some of these cities are underground with films around the city providing energy from the solar system to sun and invisible sources that were unknown to the oppressors of the past. The earth is not abused, it is nurtured and the people on earth think of themselves as curentakers who must respect the universe and all the forms of life that live in the universe. The New Atlantean Doministica also have joined an instant planetary council of other planets that have been advanced much longer than an Istica. The council's worth of pulses from the people of the planets are taken on matters that affect the civilizations on these planets. The proposals could deal with the transportation of goods from one planet to another or building materials or new advancements that the people want to let other civilizations decide an ask and know about. When the earth was liberated and the transformation happened people began a new educational system that were totally decentralized and new forms of vegetation were developed. For instance, taking a talking using verbal language was not always necessary. Telepathy was rediscovered and since many other civilizations in the universe had been using telepathy before this became common with our people. The use of history books was flicking more in hate with destroy but the knowledge of what the wars did was used to show the people that this was never happened again. Men and women, girls and boys all relate to each other through peaceful understanding education became an integral part of everyday life. People were taught how to use telepathy by wise people of the universe. They came to the planets to do our children and wisdom to learn about peace and understanding. This educational system was used throughout the planet and the earth became a place where anarchism was understood by people. People were only a part of the whole life system. Nature was harmonious for all living things I heard. The wilderness was not abused, the food was needed, nature provided us with fruits and vegetables and herbs from the vast wilderness. The metropolis and modern farms outside the city of the natural foods provided that provided the entire planet with all sorts of food from shape and to corn. Anisticous modern farms are powered by the sun and invisible sources of the universe. People on farms at times get wisdom from the wisdom people. The mountains, rivers, lakes, oceans, trees and flowers and all natural living organisms are respected by all on anistic Earth. The New Atlanticians have a natural understanding of nature which the rich never had ever explored during their time and power. The old earth has many problems with pollution and airplanes to trust. The new earth that came about after the transformation had the most modern transportation available in the tropical places. People walk to where they want to or use the sorcery, small transportation system that runs from the town hall in the middle of the system powered by the sun drains. Now they stop there. Oh, thank you very much for the gift of your sharing. And understand from our perspective with a few little alterations that is somewhat close on a slightly different time track to what will be occurring in your world, perhaps minus the dark age step. We thank you. Over there, Samil. Thank you. I heard you speak about that you are telling practically linked people on the planet, on your planet. Yes, that is the idea of our form of communication at this time and on particular, shall we say, evolution loosely speaking of our species, we no longer have language and simply in a tell empathic way, which is by the way a little bit more descriptive of the mechanism than tell empathic. Communicate with each other and understand each other, soul to soul, due to proceed. Well, I wanted to know if you can do the same with us. Yes. In a sense, this is how we communicate with you. Above and apart from the verbal level, there are communications taking place on other levels, but we are only able in that sense to access what you will allow for one of the only limitations that we place upon ourselves is the idea that anything that in any way, shape or form, any way, shape or form would take away your power. We shield from our awareness, thereby and therefore would not interfere or in that sense, shall we say, read thought that you would not wish us to have. So in that sense, you are in a safe space, so to speak. But the idea is empathy functions from unconditional love on both ends, and therefore you and your society somewhat have an ability to shut that door, and we wish not to open it unless you wish it to be open. And this is often why when speaking to individuals, we will ask them questions to lure them closer to themselves to open up certain, shall we say, door way through which then we can look and give our perspective. But it will never be imposed, and we never say ha ha. I understand, I think, what I want to say, is that I think I've been kind of clogging the chain like that. In a sense. And being very appreciative, because I think it's really a change in me, and I just think I've been talking to you. A lot of us to thank you for instituting the change and allowing the communications both way. And you do not have to simply think you have been talking to us, you have. Oh, yeah. Our stream, as we have shared, is always available in that sense to anybody who wishes to partake of it from your society. We are assisted in that way. I think I feel like a success story, and I think my perception is just kind of a shift here, like it would turn out a light, a sun on a puddle off. Well, thank you. I think, as I was coming here, I was thinking, it feels like, you know, pieces of the, I felt like a puzzle, or thinking as a puzzle, and I think like the pieces of getting in and feel really good. Oh, thank you very much for realizing that they always fit. Or the idea is this is what happens as you expand, you realize that this was always the case. Synchronicity always occurred. Simply, you did not give yourself the opportunity to see it and then act upon it. Now you are doing so. But you have instituted the change again, perhaps bouncing some ideas off of us. And you have also illustrated that. If one of the beliefs that you are willing to change is the one we are about to share, that it is that simple. As individuals in that sense begin to explore their relationship with all that is or God, what they ultimately discover when they seem in some sense to have reconnected, the first knowingness that occurs with the seeming reconnection was that there was never a disconnection. Ever. It is an apparently. So you are simply in a sense, lifting self-imposed vows. But I feel I use now, like before I thought, have you heard the expression, all things, like in psychology, you can say. We understand. Now it is like I use new things, like your things or other things that I am listening to. I think this is enough and then I have a question. Oh, thank you. First of all, for being bold. For we have noticed quite a difference in your willingness to state who you are with conviction and also for sharing the viewpoint with the new and old tape analogy that you need not run from the old tape, the process of simply walking toward the new tape distances you from the old tape without fixating on the idea of the old tape. Thank you. No question. Yeah, the question is, I just found out that I have a new boss and I've met him and I wanted to have you speak about how do you see the situation when the new man begins. Well the idea is that you've always had the same boss yourself and this is a particular definitional relationship upon your planet. Simply establish in your own thoughts in your own mind the parameters that you wish to establish and perhaps though there is some sense of a hierarchy you can remain on an overall sense as an equal and therefore by feeling as an equal we'll act that way and find you are treated in a sense within the confines again of the hierarchy that exists as more of an equal. Well I think yeah and I think the confidence I have now is like I want to allow anyone to do something that like you said that doesn't please me or it doesn't that's not what I prefer. We'll also recognize that even within the parameters of the hierarchies you set up upon your planet an acceptable way to communicate when there is something that you do not prefer is no thank you. Thank you. And we thank you as well. Over there, Zenden? The shark I know I'm here to explore physicality and the suicide at Cyprus but there are some things that I see that concern me very much and I'm trying to find out how I should feel about these things. I see things such as murder and starvation and child abuse and many things that I know that people are exploring negativity and I see that and I don't have to accept that myself. And so I'm concerned that I should try and help those people change from what I perceive as negative to what I would perceive as more positive. Do you have the opportunity to interact with them in a way where you could be of service? Well, I could create that opportunity as I decided to, but I'm not sure if I should get involved in it or leave those people to their exploration. Well this will obviously be your decision, but the idea is from your perspective all you can even do is if you wish to be of service in that way, attract those types of situations to you and be of service in whatever way you can, but it will be up to you. We are not saying be indifferent to these things simply that if they do not apply directly to you, you need not lose sleep over them the individuals that are involved in those scenarios or playing out and discovering those scenarios. If you feel yourself preoccupied with these thoughts because you do wish to be of service, then go right ahead. We are not saying stay away from it if you wish to be of service. Does this make sense? Yes. Does that answer the question? Yes. I'll ask you another question. Please do. You can ask. Thank you. In creating our own reality, when we get married and have a partner that we've chosen to know what you like with, are we co-creating our reality together to that point? Or are we still just creating our single reality? It is both. From your perspective, you are creating your reality from her perspective, perhaps. She is creating her reality. There is the marriage, the relationship itself, a third co-creation in a sense, but from your end, your end of the relationship, you are still ultimately the creator. So therefore, you cannot control, so to speak, what they do, the explorations they choose and decide on, but you always have 100% ability to choose how you wish to interact. So for instance, if you have a particular discourse between you, you will always have the choice of your contribution to the conversation. If there is a certain, shall we say, automatic mode that gets set up, as you say in your society, certain buttons that individuals seem to create and allow to be pushed, you can always control from your end, your reaction, your response. Therefore, you still have total control over, shall we say, having the outcome be preferential from your perspective, not by however creating buttons and allowing them to be pushed, but by seeing when you do create these buttons and it seems as though they are pushed, remembering their, your button, you are pushing them and rather than simply re-acting, looking at the beliefs and the definitions as to why you have such a button. So therefore, again, from your end of the interaction, you create it 100% from their end of the interaction they created 100%. Again, not this or that, this and that, both. It may seem like a paradox, but when in that sense, you begin to approach the perimeters of paradox, you are getting the idea. But does that help? Yes, very much. Thank you. And to you as well. Over there. I'm not really. Why not? It simply was not part of the exploration in the sense of our civilization, though we have gone through similar steps as your civilization has, shall we say, loosely speaking, and we do not mean this in a derogatory sense, we started out with a bit of a head start. Our exploration started out by definition as containing less limitation, less separation. So we always had more in that sense, a sense of our self creating our own reality. There was at some point for a very brief period within our history, the idea you might lay back on the table this ease, but even that was very short lived. Prosy? So, as our society advances, our disease level and our habit that we wouldn't want to just smoking and wait, we're also disappearing. Well, in a sense, it will always be up to the individual, but the trend when you begin to live consciously according to preference is that these things begin to transform out because individuals understand that they are simply symbols. And when you allow a symbol to deliver a message, it transforms. When you ignore the message over and over again, it seems, this is only also an apparently, but it seems to hang around. We look when discussing weight that you are speaking of in your society more from the symbolic viewpoint than, shall we say, the physical viewpoint. For to us, weight is a symbol. And in general, through a coincidence of your language, weight in general has something to do with the idea of individuals rather than going and doing the things that move them participating as a participant in their reality are literally waiting around. Does this make sense? Yes, the exercising is on your planet. Not really because in our flow of spontaneous creation of our lives, basically by doing what we need to do when we need to do it to fulfill the preferences and desires and longings for learning and exploration and growth, there is as a byproduct of not waiting around by doing automatically enough exercise. Your society is structured in such a way where individuals are easily able to choose to do things that they do not prefer. This is what creates the idea of weighting rather than moving. When you are actively engaged, allowing yourself to see in any given moment from what's available, the thing with integrity that excites you the most you are constantly moving. And to you as well, over there. Be sure. Be sure. Be sure. It's dear heaven. Yes. Be sure. And you can choose to create it on earth. It is a frame of mind. It is an aptitude. We understand the symbolic reference of the style of heaven that you speak about upon your planet. And if an individual believes in that scenario upon passing or death as we have shared, whatever you believe most strongly is what you will experience. So there can also be the literal experience of the style of heaven usually referred to in your society. Because the idea is from our perspective you need not escape from earth to get to heaven. You can simply manifest personally heaven on earth when you are willing to do that and continue to live that way. Because again, you only attract the reality you are the vibration of. Your immediate surroundings begin to reflect your inward heaven. The individuals around you seem to change, seem to literally become at least an attitude more angelic. Yes. That answers part of the question. The other part of the question is in the Bible and in the fallest of the moment and of course the miracle. There is always a reference to this war that took place in heaven and that bothers me. How could a war take place in heaven? From our perspective it cannot. It is simply in that sense either a misinterpretation in some instances in others a purposeful distortion. Understand from our perspective and again we do not present this as the only way. It is simply what we have found in what works for us. But why we call God all that is is there simply is nothing that is not and again we mean this colloquially within God. Everything is God. There is no outside. So therefore within God does exist the idea of conflict but you need not say that heaven is embodied by conflict and much of the idea simply gives a rationale for the continuance of polarity what you label good and evil. And to you is everything such a thing as good and evil. From our perspective they are simply judgmental stand points. They are rather arbitrary. What we mean is from our perspective there is positive which is integrative integrating which means understanding everything is within all that is. Therefore everything is all one thing. Now there are particular actions that you would take if you truly believe this that are integrative actions treating everything as an extension of yourself that is positive. There is the idea of negative which is the denial of everything as all one thing separation judgment and so forth. So the idea is within your own language in your own concepts not always things that are labeled positive are always considered by all individuals to be good. Certain individuals will find things that are negative. This integrative separative things to be good and others will say that things which are positive and integrative are bad. Therefore it is very arbitrary. In other words it depends who you speak to. So we refrain in general from using the terminology good and bad good and evil and simply speak about positive and negative. But basically what you are saying is all is from the person's point of view as to what is. What they will experience. Thank you. And to you. Sherry. Please. And to you. Great. And to you. Great. And how sharing. Did you get our greetings the other evening? Thank you. Thank you. We listened to it. And we did not to show our own channeling a meditation. So I had a communion with the data which was very interesting. There was no communication or no message that I felt that was coming through. But you all are busy as a bee. And I had a visual of a data right in front of me and then after that there were like five of them up on the hill and the refinery and I realized that I never do it long one at a time and they are always in group. And not necessarily but we understand. Well yeah I mean I realize that there was one right with me and then there was a round. But then what was interesting for me was when I felt your energy come through it was like oh my because I had expected it. Well congratulations. And I was it was just a lot of fun exploring that and having that happen and also gaining more confidence. I think in the line of the exploration with the data because I still don't quite know what I'm going to be doing. I you know there was no I felt no desire for communication from them other than that I invited them again. And that was as far as it went. I felt a little bit of fear. But I also received it wasn't mine. Well the idea is a co-created fear. One moment one moment. Yours that would be through you in that sense do you. And certain things will seem to unfold most quickly within the next two to three months of your time in regards to some at least clarification about why you are drawn in such a direction. Yes. When I decided that what was going to just take time to do is when it started happening and then I had been treating little streamers book majestic. And then I picked up two books coincidentally at the library on your phone with some more information. So I got really excited about that and I feel for some reason that has some connection to do with the data and that will unfold as I go along. But I'm having a lot of fun. Unfold away. Have a good time and stay in touch. We thank you very much for in that sense placing the call and understand because it is the nature of the spontaneous approach of members of our society that it will in general be unexpected. Again, you may recall loosely speaking this is quite colloquial but you will understand the reference when individuals upon our planet passed each other on the street and again we have no language so use your imagination. But the idea is one individual says how is it going and the other says not as I expected the shall we say usual reply in congratulations. For the idea is the discovery the joy of the surprise is part of the advantage to the type of unfoldment that you create this very reality to experience. And if you already know it all one of the things you cannot experience is discovery surprise experiencing things as if anew. So under Sam when individuals ask well why would I impose a forgetfulness upon myself this is the very reason for the joy of discovery can be the agony of the unexpected but that is up to you. And it can be the joy of discovery. Is that all? That's all for now thank you and to you. Shelley. Would you please describe all that is to the extent that we that say has third density can rest that and for example I would say well unconditional love is one way to describe a one aspect of all that is is all that is a being as we would. Oh thank you very much. This very simple and I in that sense will keep it as simple as possible. All that is is all that is. However at the same time that it is everything simultaneously it also has shall we say a self aware consciousness in a sense you can use the analogy that anything that you contain being that you are made by the way quite literally from your own literature in the image and likeness of God that if you yourself can have an individual self reflective consciousness so can all that is. So again a bit paradoxical it is an infinite concept but all that is is everything that is simultaneously each thing separately and at the same time maintains a self awareness that you would consider to be something that you could just screely communicate with and the parameters of the relationship is always up to you any relationship that you can imagine you can enjoy with all that is any physical relationship that exists upon you on planet brother friend lover confidant boss or whatever is a relationship that you can create but you are literally an extension of all that is therefore as drops to the ocean one and the same material and you contain all the potentiality of all that is all that is is holographic and what this means is that every point within non physical reality so to speak and physical reality more literally contains all other points did that help. Are we equal to all that is or do we only have the potential to become qualitatively absolutely equal there is an apparently from your end that perhaps not quantitatively but because qualitatively you are you have the potentiality as well to be quantitatively did that translate. I think so you're putting a lot on me to think about what about the idea or the expression and the concept of becoming one with God well as we had earlier share when you actually quote unquote achieve that state of mind it brings with it the instant awareness that you were never separated to begin with so simply understand that now and you can save yourself a large process. From a fourth density standpoint is the understanding and being able to grasp all that is stronger or better or different equal though we realize it and express the understanding more readily and the idea is any aspect of physicality by definition utilize as the imposition of certain limitation. So we also more consciously speaking impose particular limitation so that we can experience fully physicality but we understand that we impose them so we do not give our power away that they were imposed upon us now you contain in merely that you may on any level of understood what we have just shared the same potential what we in that sense are presenting to you is that you may now if you wish you don't have to you don't have to have too much fun but you may express this at any time is grasping and understanding infinity a prerequisite to really totally relating to all that is not really emotionally from your standpoint you can identify with but shall we say to have a total overall understanding to some degree that would be one limit the idea that becoming finite by definition gives you somewhat of an inability in that particular form of exploration to grasp infinity and since again all that is infinite perhaps you could say loosely speaking that you are choosing at this time by creating this reality purposefully to not experience the infinite shall we say concept but anything you can imagine does exist so think about that for a while. I also identify the word the creator with at least my idea I guess of all that is and therefore the creator if I made creation of the creator somehow time wise I came later in a sense in a sense the physical you and perhaps the embody soul in a sense would have that a parent but you are as all that is multi-dimensional infinite and eternal as well so truly this is only an apparent. Thank you very much and you as well understand all that is existed before the concept of purpose so therefore is not bound to the concept of needing to have a particular purpose it simply is and purpose is one of the concepts within it just thought we taught that in. Where is the shark physically located right now right now I am aboard what you would label my scout craft in a state of repose upon what you might label a projection table through which my mentality is linked in a synchronized resonant way with the quote unquote mentality of what you might call because it is the closest word you contain in your language a computer aboard my craft that enables me again loosely speaking to amplify my thoughts in a way that interacts with the mentality of the channel before you and the mentality of the channel before you is what the words in a sense are plucked from that match the concept that we are sending at this particular timing my scout craft within which our two other individuals is orbiting my home planet of esosano. What biological properties do you can ask similar to your own a body of its shorter about five feet in height to man a form in that sense to arms two legs ahead two eyes and so forth we breathe oxygen our planet is a bit more oxygen rich than you own. Not really we absorb energy directly from both our environment and from our central seed map which is our stuff. One of the expressions of it again we exchange energy with the environment directly one of the aspects of which is the sun. There is the vestigial ability to eat in the sense that you mean there is the retention of some of the ideas you would label food but again as we are progressing toward non-physicality this is something that is less and less partaken up. As you go higher in the density is there greater and greater light and less and less night. In a sense you may say that in an overall sense of light if you mean sunlight not necessarily know our planet still turns upon its axis and though that will result in night and day we are no longer so tied to the cycle of it but again there is equal approximately depending upon where you are on the planet timing per twenty five hour period of night and day. What is the difference between what you are doing in our planet and people are getting the heart transplant. Is that considered for a VR? Oh no that is created. Very interesting usage of resources. Really but again from our perspective all this ease is a product of your consciousness so once you create that symbol that notion you will then in general if you decide to allow yourself to quote unquote heal create another acceptable symbol to allow you to do so and that instance is a quite a fascinating idea of juxtapositions of symbols to allow you to in a sense be all right to heal yourself. Thank you for sharing. And do you? I have a question I had the lights go out again recently. I told him to fit and I keep the lighting of this my own memory and your house lights or your personal lights. My house lights went out and no the lights in the neighborhood were out except the lights in my house. The lights in October 10th they didn't go out they didn't pretty good and then they went back to normal lighting. Do you explain why this is happening? No however have a good time with it you are scratching the surface and simply understand that there is significance to it obviously or it would not keep getting your attention in that sense. I must say that I felt very relaxed and comfortable when it happened there was nobody around the house and it just happened and I and this is interesting. Well thank you very much you are beginning to rely on the inner light and not need outer light to validate it. Thank you. Is that all? At this time allow us to pause for a short break and resume contact in this fashion in 10 to 15 of your minutes.
