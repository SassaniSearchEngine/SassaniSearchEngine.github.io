 Alright, I'll take. Before we continue, your entitlement for this interaction will simply be......heading. Proceed. Face. Off, day of view. Proceed. I've been exposed to a long series of tapes by a person called Drumbelomel-Keeza-Deck. Oh, what? I am familiar with the energy. I haven't put together yet an understanding of how we will get from here to the there that is talking about 1B. I thought 1B. Plant the lever over. This is the essential dress. Oh, right. Here to there. Proceed. He got into an issue which I don't particularly favor are the all the negative events supposedly of 15 years. Ah, are you going to throw your baby out with your bath water? Definitely. Oh, right. Then, by all means, feel free in a completely loving and validating......mode to simply have certain ideas be a reinforcement reflection of who you are and other ideas to simply allow you to define who you are with an example of who you are not. And understand, tumultuous events will be experienced by those who invested in it. So it is not an accurate to say that some version of that will play out in some reality. Perhaps the question is, will it be yours? Or I need not be concerned with any of the 60 or so ideas that will end this planet unless I choose to buy into them. Absolutely up to you. But there are people who will buy into it and will experience degrees of extreme limitation also. Whereby the experience of another is close enough to the vibration of your own experience, you will seem to continue to exist on the same one Earth expression. Whereby other individual's choices are so far diverging from your own, simply your apparently will be to become unaware of each other, both literally creating a different parallel Earth. I'm redefining that we've been over that before, but with this new information, I just want to do one more time with you. Rosie? Well, that was it, basically, with these new drum will-o tapes. He did present a very effective hydro-statistically speaking of... Perhaps you can ignore 59 out of 60 things that he says can consume the Earth, but one of them won't have to get you. I really wanted to redefine the same idea that we've done before. It is a very interesting prospect as to what individuals will choose to use as evidence. So therefore, again, the belief that you express results in the reality that you will see and experience, the evidence and so forth, that you will create to support the decision. You can be aware of such a choice. You can actually, in your expanding awareness, be aware of others going through such a choice, while you are so-called untouched, yet still aware. So, expanding awareness, expanding across the board, will not only make you necessarily more aware of the positive, but also of the negative, because both exist as an option. The question is, which one will you decide trust and act on, which will be the experiential reality that you, in that sense, experience as an individual? This series was directed at assisting people into getting through the change to a force density, I believe, would be the idea. Not in ignoring it or being victimized by the awareness, actually going through with conscious reality, whereas other people might have to die and be reborn physically to get there. Oh, both options are available. Would you validate that much of the energy behind the predictions again? Or based on what you would term to be ancient predictions, which were again made, from the mindset of the society, which back then could only be understood that such great change could happen by a complete tearing down of the present society. So, that idea, that overtone, finds its way into what you call many of your modern predictions. However, that assumes that there is one the past, one right now and one the future, which is also a decision to see your reality, to interpret and interact with your reality in that way. If there is one the future and that is your definition of what it is, you will create some version of that experience. If you understand that there are an infinite number of probable outcomes, and that your decision right now can determine which outcome you experience, regardless of everyone else's experience, you can still be aware of the idea, but use it to align yourself with your reality. And therefore, it is a full assistance, fully valid and completely useful. Now, the case of that space, there are predictions, as you said, on long past times, using a super geometry, as they call it, which you came up with a version of once, having to do with our progression of events, starting with Roswell, I believe in 47, and Star Trek, in the Netherlands, in the diagram. How is this diagram progressing? Are we in effect on schedule or? Very much so, and from my perspective, you will begin to see more of the idea, for instance, in that scene that you have brought up of your government beginning to release information that they have here to for, denied. And this is beginning to happen. There have been several mild examples of the process of acclimating you to the idea, so that when indeed there is a disclosure, it is not so shocking and abrupt. I have a personal sensing that by the year 2005 would be a time when we would become quite aware of the fourth dimensional effect, but that may be just when I will become aware of it. As a group of consensus reality, when will that energy feel that it's really coming in? Understand, I remind you, I am not in the business of predictions. However, sensing the energy that is present right here, right now, the only place and time there is, approximately on mass, an individual experience will vary. Approximately what you call your 2012, perhaps you can say entering more or less the completion of that phase in your 2025 years. Again, this can all change simply by decisions made right now, but that is my present sensing. I have done nothing. Thank you. Sherry, nice. So here I am sitting here, very positive, taking me to my future to be positive. Someone next to me is not thinking that way. There are different minds that are different from reality. At some point in time, these positive realities will somehow be created for the students who are living around the country. Though it may appear that someone else may have what you have perceived to be a contradictory viewpoint to your own, there still can be the same foundational vibration of understanding, the same sense of options, the same sense of possibilities, which can allow a commonality in vibration to seem to exist on the same world. If that continues, regardless of specific viewpoint and differences, you will appear to continue to be aware of that person. If that gets to the point where you are so different in your approach that you begin to change the foundational vibration of who you are, again, serendipitously, automatically, simply, seeming to happen, individuals will simply no longer be to your awareness, whether it is your perception that they have moved, whether you have lost consciousness. Whether you have lost contact with them, whether they physically seem to die, and they can actually continue on on an earth that is slightly out of phase with your own earth, them seeming from their perspective to simply have a smooth transition from one moment to the next in their lives, you having the same transparency, but literally occupying different realities. That's how these shifts will be made there. They are being made all the time. In that sense, always have been, always will be. There is more of an awareness of it now because you are now expanding to the point as individuals to begin to entertain the ideas that we are seeking up to begin with. I think it's like deeply. I see there is another New York somewhere, another Massachusetts, another Connecticut identical to this. Oh, there are many. There are in fact an infinite number. This means that not only every existing earth is so unlike you in a way that you would not choose to be, there are also earths that are already the way you say you wish to be. By making a decision in the moment, you can spontaneously shift. That is why no effort is necessary to completely create, recreate your reality in any given moment. There is a corresponding resident, so to speak, that already exists right now. Does that make sense? Sure does. I understand that these concepts can be confusing. It's more clarifying now because while I've been reading, everything is accurate, if that's what you want to be. But your apparent is that you are going on a straight line on the quote unquote same earth, and so therefore experientially that is accurate for you. Perhaps you can say all you need to know. Well, in knowing that there are other alternate realities, it makes more sense. Alright, and perhaps it is useful to understand that everything already exists right now, so it is simply a matter of expressing it rather than having to do something laborious and effortful in order to get it. No matter what it is. Now are these other realities experiencing the same types of things as far as their awareness, developing their awareness system? Some yes, some no, depending on the definition of those realities. A reality that chooses to remain contracted, physical, separated for whatever their reasons are, would in a sense not seem to have the same types of ideas. And this is why I mention not to baffle and overwhelm you, but this is why I mention that there are an infinite number. Every possibility already exists, and it is simply a matter of expressing one or another. Sherry, your view in an empowered reality, empowering you so. I heard earlier Martha was bringing up another consciousness challenge in the end of this year that we would have no more free will. Now that obviously is somewhere on another reality. Well, individuals in what you perceive to be, your present reality may choose to buy into that and create that effect. What can technically be happening is they can then reside from your perspective in a different reality from who you are right now. So it is again not inaccurate to make such a prediction. It is simply perhaps you can say a regional effect. We have a pan and play of choices here, and an infinite number, again, not to overwhelm you. So what's the point? The point is you get the choose. It is up to you and because it already exists, as you say, I will use your terminology liberally, no problem. Simply pick and be. You need not move a mountain to be who you wish to be. There is already reality where the mountain is moved. So do speak. Does this make sense? Oh, yes, perfect sense. Oh, what? Perfect sense. Thank you. Nice. Our mind sends enormous greetings to you from Florida. Can you ask me to tell you that? Oh, thank you. Received and reserved in kind. Peggy also sends loving, fond wishes to you from Florida. All right, postcards from the edge. The question I have is in regards to last month when you did your presentation. The next day, Christine and I tried to get back to New York. And for some reason, which I would love you to clarify, for four hours, we somehow stayed on the lay line of connected end fields. We had directions, we had come over here very easily. It was raw daylight. None of us do any monitoring substances. And yet for some reason, for four hours, we stayed in some sort of a time war and couldn't get out of this vicinity until the time that your private session with Peggy was over. Now, we were really unhappy at that moment, but we kept trying to look at the bright side. And somehow we got a message that perhaps your spacecraft in conjunction with our own choices, because we know that nothing is extraneous, our choices and our intent to move to a higher vibration. Somehow we needed to be in this lay line. And we kept going from Massachusetts to Vermont back to Massachusetts back to Connecticut for four hours. And I was living in 30 different countries, so I know how to get one place to another. And yet we couldn't get out of here like an invisible barrier until this meeting was taken over, which at that moment we were unaware that the meeting was going on at that time. When it was over, somehow something lifted and we made it to New York in a straight shot just like that. So you have any clarity on that? Oh, absolutely. First of all, that's what you get when you try. Second of all, synchronicity in timing. It would appear that one event was related to another. However, it is up to you to decide the relationship, the meaning, and use that meaning to reinforce ideas within yourself. Third, and most obviously, it gave you an opportunity to interact with the other beings that you are with. And there are certain ideas that have already come out of that and more that will as you resolve some of these ideas. Wonderful. I've done nothing. You did it all. Pat yourself on the back. And her. I want to ask you one more question, which is, I'm very shy the way to ask you, and I want to find out if I can ask you something very good. I can ask you something very intimate and personal and it has to do with human sexuality on Earth. Go right ahead. You don't come out just fine. I assure you. I'm okay. You've got a lot of attention. And I know it's ultimately within my choice of what I want to see it as, but other than peer pleasure, we know that the male organization is for the procreation of species as well as pleasure. What is the clitoral female orgasm for? Simply to allow you to explore sensorial reality, particular sensation. In this particular instance, it is akin to what you sometimes refer to as a sneeze in the idea of a building up, a peaking, an appreciation of the peaking experience, and then whatever you create after that. But that is one of the energetic themes in that sense. If you wish to look at it merely mechanically, what you will refer to as male orgasm may seem to be simply for the idea of procreation, but it is far more than that. It is also, again, an available option of physical sensorial experience whereby you can express your energy in a very focused and specific way. Now, when you speak up one thing happening and another thing happening, perhaps you are missing the idea of the combination of both things happening. Again, loosely speaking, being a co-creation. A third event, which, again, each individual will then interpret and create their own version of. That is extremely helpful. And last month, our interaction was so incredible for me. Incredible. Incredible. It was, you gave some support. It felt like a lot of encouragement. You even referred to the words Pazimam and Pazimaj, which I have introduced that night. Very creative. Thank you. I enjoy language. In the meantime, I have written a booklet calling it Pazimagic, partly because of that interaction with you, and I've even developed some land, a place called Pazimam, where you can be the wizard of the city. You can be the wizard of Pazim, and you can share, even if you're from Kansas, and it's all written as a result of the meeting with you, land, none. Are you positive? Oh. Yes. Yes. I do. It is simply a result of the expression of your own finding. And I thank you. My pleasure. Oh, what? Mine too. In that case. Is that all? Yes. Thank you. I appreciate it. Oh, what? Thank you, thank you. And you're welcome. Shitty. You all right? Hey. Did your cloak arise? Not yet. Oh, what? But I'm positive, they will. Oh, what? I'll be close. I'll be close. It's positive, Lee. It's funny because tonight it seems a lot of us are very concerned, and most people are, about this idea of prediction, and where we are doing. Well, many of the so-called predictions are due any time now. So there is a lot of investment of seeing. Is it going to happen? Isn't it going to happen? I think it is happening. I also believe that most all of us like it, whether it's conscious or unconscious, but we enjoy and have chosen this life of process. I think we enjoy a process. Well, again, there is what you may refer to as the uncertainty factor that you all seem to create to slice things up of it. I enjoy the process, and I know what planet and what earth I'm going to be on in 20, 30 years or so. Oh, how about right now? Right now. I'm on the earth right now. And it's a so-called process, though, between... I'm not complaining at all. I enjoy it. I enjoy my day-to-day adventure of life, turning the corner and finding something new. But what? Nobody. About all? Almost calling it. What I'm getting into is that I know... I'm going to move. I am moving. I've decided to move to Tucson, Arizona. For specific reasons in detail, I'm not sure if I'll find out that when I get there. But I know that... Are you, by the way, moving towards something that inspires you or running from where you are? No. I'm running towards the thing that inspires me and excites me very much. I simply point out the distinction, do proceed. Okay. And by the way, my sensing, if you will allow me to be so bold, is that you vacillate. But that is simply my sensing, up to you, to decide. Okay. I'll keep that in mind as I go about the next few months. Oh. I plan on leaving in the next few months or so. Getting there is an excitement for me because of this idea of Earth changes. No, I don't think New York is going to fall into the ocean, right? Well, I just didn't get it. You're right. But, well, you know what? On my planet, on my Earth. There are going to be some great changes. I don't think they're going to be as catastrophic as some say, but I do believe in this change. Oh, believe in this change. And they are physical. And I know that that's not quite your perspective all the time, but I think... Oh, by the way, all of these possibilities play out somewhere. So I am not saying these things do not exist as an option. I am simply pointing out that there is a mass perception that they are etched in stone, and the idea is no longer steeped in the idea that it is an option. And that is the distinction that I am in that sense conveying to you. What I believe about Earth, I believe is your perspective, too, but clarify it. And that's the idea that as we shift our consciousness, we are the consciousness of Earth, and that the Earth has doctor points as we do, and that these energy points in the planet are actually moving and shifting. Oh, look. Do you allow for the allowance that in any given moment you can spontaneously simply heal and behold? Yes or no? Yes. Do you not grant the idea of the consciousness you call your planet the same slack? Need that balancing, be tumultuous. And is that not in some way a function of your own definition system that assumes still to a large degree? That balance, that change, that restoration of equilibrium must have tumultuous effects. I understand that. Now, if you function without as a foundation, you will continue to produce that effect through your physical personage as well. Now, I am not saying, do one, do the other, be this, be that, simply pointing out that should you continue to choose to buy into the theory that change can only come from a shaking and breaking and a transformation and a wrenching, gut wrenching catharsis. Then in some way you will continue to express that in your life no matter where you go. And so you may wish to look at why you continue to find it attractive to define that transformation must take place in those terms. And to what degree your actions are not so much a running toward something that enthuses you, but a running away from New York thinking into the water. That's not my, that's, maybe I'm being misunderstood because it really isn't how I feel. I don't think it's going to be catastrophic and terrible. But perhaps you are not being misunderstood simply being ambiguous. The energy is shifting. It is right now and whether it happens immediately or it happens gradually over the next few years, I prefer that actually because I'd like to experience it. I want to watch sunrises and sunsets. I want to experience this transformation, this assumption in my timing. And I want to enjoy that because that's my choice of being here on Earth now. Oh, why? So I say this because there's some details. There are details to our lives. Some of my interests have to do with these details such as Crystal Skulls, such as different entities, different beings, but yourself who I'm communicating with. I feel like that's a whole part of the story, this book that I live in. And going west and being there, I am going to be able to observe some amazing Earth changes. Oh, why? And you know what I'm talking about because I feel like you share that with me. And that Earth doesn't have to be experienced in a negative sense at all. It can be done very positively, but I don't think any of us want to do it overnight. That's what my belief is anyway. Speaking again from my own sensing, many individuals would desire to do it overnight. Others in that sense prefer what you call the gradual approach. Simply in that sense, giving yourself a better seek at any rate can be a positive thing from your perspective. Wow. That surprises me actually that's everything you just said because I don't know. Well, you are assuming that all individuals are in common agreement. Right. They are not. Absolutely not. Just as certain individuals will allow themselves to expand before a seeming math threshold is reached, other individuals will also do so after. And this is the individuality, the multiplicity of playing out of the transformation. Briefly, I'd like to ask about the skulls because I believe in this energy shifting that is happening right now. Whether how fast that is, I don't know. But the idea of Tibet, okay, there is this idea of a theoretical skulls into that, okay? The idea is that they are going to shift and move to supposedly four corners here in North America. Now, what's your perspective on that? This is all very arbitrary and symbolic. Okay. From my perspective. Right. It's a theory. In other words, should you choose to experience that? Should that be the foundation upon which you base your experience, then that will be your particular experience? I've experienced a foretelling of my own future. Now, if that's from desire, I'm not really clear on this. Oh, may I ask you a question in the foretelling of your own future? When do you get the cloak? Or is not your foretelling that a statistic? No, this is a statistic foretelling that I saw. Okay, when do I get the cloak? Tomorrow! Enjoy! Alright. Keep warm. Anyway, this foretelling of this future has to do with this transparent fluid like four to six foot thick wall that will appear while I'm sitting in the desert somewhere. Specifics, I don't know. But that in essence is what's happening. What I'm doing at that time is something that excites me very much. And as I'm doing it, this fourth dimensional, this idea of transformation happens to me right there. And this wall will appear, and it's very milky like substance. It will almost part or split away, and you're going to be there, and there's going to be lots of others there. The idea of spacecraft, of course, is there too. And the idea also is that I will transcend, go out for a ride, if you will, and come back. Not that I'm running away or escaping planet Earth, but I have a very strong feeling about this. And that's my fourth dimension. Enjoy. Thank you. What's your perspective on that? I believe for me, but I want to see your end of it. My particular perspective is from my experiential perception. What you are defining as our craft landing in the middle of the desert and meeting you in this way in the near future is not likely. I don't know, it's not a landing, but okay, I understand. In terms of your willingness to experience your transformation spontaneously, there is a high degree of likelihood behind that possibility, but it is up to you, not etched in stone. Fortelling is simply a new option. I understand. Your perspective on this white milky substance of a wall. Simply would correspond to the idea that you still play separation between these levels of consciousness as opposed to understanding that they all exist simultaneously within each other, so to speak. There are symbols that appear. I understand. It allows you to symbolically walk through what you now perceive to be a solid wall between third and fourth density reality, softening off the wall a little bit. Okay. But still creating that theming separation. The paradox is, were you to do this and get to what you would perhaps call the fourth density side of the wall, the wall will simply dissolve. You will understand that both one side of the wall, the other side of the wall and the wall itself are all you. I understand that. And I know it's all you are. And you are far more likely in a physical sense, at least right now, to experience this in what you call your sleeping dream reality as opposed to your way. As opposed to your waking dream reality, though it is not impossible to do so in your waking dream. Right. This is my mission, if you will. We all have missions. We all have it. You all create the idea of missions and then go on them. Yes. That's where we all came here. But no mission is designated to you from an external source. There is no external source. It's my choice. I am the source. Oh, thank you very much. Oh, thank you. Thank you, everyone. Nice. My sense is tonight there is a theme pervading throughout most everything that's been talked about. And that is our tendency to vacillate in between decisions and staying with them. That is one interpretation of the theme. Why do we have humans have that tendency? I mean, we clearly understand what it is you're saying to us about making decisions, trusting the decisions, and acting like we trust the decisions. It's what we have to do with what you call commitment. It's what we have to do with our willingness to stay of the mind of who you know you are. For generally, a very short consecutive timeframe. You still have the tendency to express the idea that seeing is believing. And so, though you may choose to express a particular empowered decision, to the degree that you feel that it is challenged by what you are interpreting as evidence of the contrary. And when you feel here is evidence that my decision hasn't stuck, my decision must not have stuck. You now make a new decision. This evidence proves and helps me to reestablish my decision. There is the vacillation. Interpreting certain phenomenon after making the decision about who you are through the eyes of an old decision and not the new one. And simply understanding this, simply coming to terms with it, hearing it in this language is all it takes to decide something else. To allow yourself to remain steadfast. To understand that trusting the decision is maintenance of the decision. Is willingness sometimes to recommit to it? If you allow a circumstance in your reality to talk you out of your decision, you are not displaying commitment to the decision. Yes? Yes, I know you're asking me right. But now what will you do? Not using anyone else and their experience as evidence, what will you do? So the commit to the decision. Then there will be no vacillation. But I hear everyone and I know I do that, I flip and I hear everyone else doing that. Well there is your evidence that you are using to vacillate upon everyone else, etc. Be the first. Now you won't be. And when you make a decision and commit and stick to that decision, consecutively enough that you actually begin to see the circumstances representing the new decision, you will begin to see all the others that have already done something. And then you will say, well, everyone now does this. All at the same time, how amazing. But do you understand the concept? Yes, I do because I'm not experienced that so I know exactly what you're saying. But I'm not saying I do it all the time, 100% perfectly. Oh, and perhaps you will build that into your decision. You know, tonight I'm more confused than I've been in such a long time. How exciting. Co-fusing is simply pulling yourself apart, looking at all the pieces and putting yourself back together according to preference. What is the nature or fulcrum of what you are calling your confusion? I guess tonight I stepped into a place and realized the multiple, I mean the actual multiplicity of all that we have. That we have unfolded before us. Oh, one way to interpret. Let me finish the line. Me too. I'm going to go over and stand in the corner and go, you know, I don't even know what to think. Oh, what a fascinating decision. The idea of sharing with you the infinity, the multiplicity of expressions is not intended in any way to confuse or overwhelm you. Simply allow you to realize that there really is nothing effortful to do, that it is a matter of simply mid-wiping what you want. If you look at it that way, well, who I am already exists. There's nothing to become, there's nothing to do. Who I do not like myself already exists as well, but I get to choose between them. Therefore it is not overwhelming, it is more options. Choose away. Generally speaking, it is not making a decision which is confusing. It is withholding a decision which is a decision in and of itself. This is why it comes back down to commitment. If you are not committed to your decision, yes, confusion, overwhelming. If you are committed to your decision, everything that the universe requires to allow your decision to be manifest already exists. And there is your power. Does that help? Are you still confused? Not at the moment. Are you still in that sense having the tendency to make that funny sound? No. And by the way, it is not my sensing that that is, in a sense, an unconstructed act. Sometimes simply babbling in the corner can be very expressive. So by all means, should you feel the urge, as you say, go forth. And perhaps I will also experiment this evening of my time after my invisibility with a little bit of that finger idea. Thank you. Thank you yourself. Just to change the subject, can you tell us where you are and who you are with and what's happening there, where you are? Oh, presently I am upon my scout craft orbiting around my home world. I am, as you would say, alone on the ship. From time to time, depending upon my purposes. Because we are all teleempathically connected, the experience of one can be tapped into by as many individuals as wished to benefit by that experience. Although there is still perhaps you can say arbitrarily say no substitute for physical personal experience, there is still this idea of experience by proxy. Once in a while you describe a new civilization that you have come across, can you say something tonight, something interesting that you recently found, or something that we could relate to or learn from, learn from. Well, not so much as I am very enthused about the idea of trying this invisibility thing out on many different civilizations. We learn much from these interactions. And you would be surprised because you generally consider yourself to be isolated in the universe. You would be surprised at how much impact you actually have on many other civilizations, for if we become aware of an idea, perhaps you can say it finds its way down the line. And so other individuals, other civilizations can benefit from something that we discover from your civilization. And in this way you are all more in touch than perhaps you realize. In terms of describing a specific civilization that we have not before, nothing comes to mind. I am still interacting, loosely speaking with certain energetic beings that have symbolic representation or communications. Other than that, I have been very involved in my own home world as of late. Are you still making the sculptures with light and light? Not so much lately, but it can be a spontaneous emission, if you will, at any given time. So you have cultivated new hobby lately? I am very busy. I am out and about doing many things. The idea of hobby does not translate quite the same way into our sociology as to your own. There may be the idea of things that we wind up doing, synchronistically, again, or seemingly similar things that we do a similar version of. But in terms of truly labeling them habitual, ritual, hobby, it is not quite accurate. That is an interest of what you call spontaneous emission. And again, from time to time, I will do so. Lastly, can you teach us a new word tonight? I am now being called by other individuals in my society, and this interaction is about to, in that sense, translate into your language. Allow me a moment. All right. As I am now being called by other individuals in my society, and this interaction is about to, in that sense, end, I will leave you with a word. Achan. Achan, generally speaking, always. One way to interpret it is, wait up. I'm coming. In a sense. Very loose. I'm being very liberal with the language. But I thank you for the opportunity to share this, and allow me to simply say the following to all of you. The theme, if there would be a theme in all of these interactions, is that you are now to the point beyond which you are simply entertaining, participating in the creative, participating in the creation of your life. You are creating your life. You do still continue to some degree to shift your decision and not be committed to your preferred decision, and so there is still the aperrancy of random occurrence. But if you are willing to commit to that decision, if you are simply willing to understand that you are expressing deserve a big deserve ability by committing to your decision and refusing to swerve from it in any way, all the principles that we share with you are combined into one fulcrum idea. Decide who you are. You already do. No matter what. Allow that decision to be conscious. Trust that decision. You already do. No matter what the decision is, you trust it, and you act as though you trust it, and that action seems to put into effect a series of events which supports the decision. When you shift the decision, the entire reality shifts to a reality that also already exists. So there is no physical barrier to instantaneous transformation. You are simply shifting a little bit to the left, a little bit to the right, and that does not take effort. Allow yourself to get in touch with who you prefer to be. Phrase it into your decision. Commit to that decision. Do not let any particular circumstance in your reality talk you out of that decision unless you wish to explore what it is like to talk yourself out of a decision, make another decision, get the results of that eventually aligning yourself back with the preferred you. It is not very difficult to know who you desire to be. Simply ask yourself and trust the answer. No one knows you as well as you know yourself. So the theme would be to be willing to commit. In a sense, you have allowed yourself here to be committed to vacillation. Therefore, take that same strength of commitment and simply decide, as you will anyway, to apply it in the direction of your preference. Things stand out in your reality as being preferable to you, exciting to you, because that is your indication that that is who you are. The willingness to trust who you are allows you to reinforce your decision. Only you know who you are. Just because everyone does this or everyone does that means nothing unless you are defining that who you are is dependent on what everyone else says and does. Still a decision, still a commitment. But only you know you completely. Other individuals only create their version of you that will suit their purposes for their exploration in their timing. And that will generally be irrespective of your own definition of who you are, though often they can be similar. Your definition of who you are can be similar to someone's definition of who you are, but you know you the best. Trust who you are, decide to be that person consciously. Understand that conscious decision replaces random results and enjoy. I thank you for your willingness to co-create this interaction with me this evening of your time. I understand that the idea of infinity can become overwhelming, but it can also be interpreted as that many more wonderful options to choose from. Perhaps you can say as though your multi-hundred channel cable TV you get to watch what you want. I thank you and bid you most a fond and loving. Good evening.
