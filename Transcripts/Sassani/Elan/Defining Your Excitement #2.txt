 Alright, I'll say continue, sit. One moment over there, marry. And do you agree? A lot, with regards to the last question, you question. The serious energy, you've been spoken in the past frequently of the Orion energy and its influences on this planet. You haven't said to my knowledge too much about the serious energy. I have a feeling that the serious energy is connected, for instance, with the Egyptian religions. Am I correct? There is a connection through your historical, shall we say, happening with what you label your Egyptian society with a particular connection to that energy that was somewhat realized. Yes, do understand, in the sense that you would consider our civilization to represent your future, so to speak, there is a triad of energy, an energetic consciousness triad of the civilizations of your civilization, our civilization, and serious civilization. They to us, as we to you, would represent, loosely speaking, our future selves. Thank you, and one other point, and perhaps a question as well, and a sharing. Through the evening, I've been undergoing this cognitive process that was quite interesting, several weeks ago, I became interested in American actress Francis Farmer, who died in 1970, a very, very beautiful woman, and, talentedly, highly individualistic flower of American woman. She was institutionalized, given electroshock therapy, under lobotomized. The poignant story, I saw Jessica Lange's movie, Cold Francis, and then saw Francis Farmer in a movie called South, the Pay Bill or Pondo Pondo, something like that. At any rate, I've been wondering why I should be fascinated with this actress, or why my excitement should be so involved there, for what reason. At the same time, I've been contemplating the subject of judgment, and what exactly is judgment all about. I had come to the preliminary point of view that this principle of fact is to freeze realities to prevent other aspects of a reality from showing themselves, presenting themselves. Yes. Do you understand, first of all, to go in order that your connections with that individual simply have to do with? Shall we say the method through which her story touches your heart, and there is a more direct connection that you may explore on your own. The idea of judgment is that judgment in and of itself is an aspect of invalidating another portion of yourself, recognizing that everything is all one thing, an integrated whole, brings along with its certain advantages, certain visions, shall we say, that enables you to see that connection. That is what enables you, in that sense, to progress, so to speak, toward the fourth density of a more unlimited physicality. What holds you firmly into the idea of third density or limited physicality is the idea of not validating each and every aspect of anything that you see or interact with as a part and parcel of yourself, not recognizing the integration of all things. Judgment is establishing your preference in regard to a particular idea, and then if you do not prefer it, assigning it a lesser value, when in fact that is not an expression of understanding integration. Therefore, judgment or invalidation, in a sense, as you have shared, does serve in a sense to lock you into a particular form of continuing to experience a limited reality and also creates along with it because you are not willing to look at all facets of a particular issue and simply relegate it to judging it, it narrows your vision or your ability to see all the opportunities present in any given idea. My competition is a form of self embodiment. Well, in a sense, but since it is self-imposed, you can always remove that imposition, whereas your lobotomy concept implies a more permanent effect. So therefore, you can perhaps say it is more analogous to ignoring a particular portion of your brain than physically removing it. Perhaps self anesthesia will be a closer analogy. Okay, to stem a whole matter just a bit, in a sense, to create any categorization, any form of pigeonhole has the coloration of judgment. Well, again, the strongest definition we can render of judgment is this. You have discernment and you have judgment. I prefer this idea. I do not prefer this idea. If you simply leave it at that level, that is part of your process of self definition, expanding self awareness. When you then continue on to say that the thing that you do not prefer absolutely stinks and has no place, that is judgment. That is assigning a lesser value, even though, as we have shared, all ideas are equal. Your willingness to view all ideas as equal gives you equal access to choose either of them. Your willingness to assign an uneven weight to a particular idea actually lessens your access to the opposite idea that you say you prefer. So it is a self-limiting mechanism that individuals perpetuate. But again, it always boils down to you. Your willingness to judge always has to do with your willingness to judge yourself and feel judged. So therefore, if you take it back home and find when you are judging yourself rather than simply continuing to do it and be rating yourself for judging yourself, if you will begin to use even that, use that you are judging to trace it back to what at least you must have to be judging, even the judgment itself can be seen to be of service and transformed to equality. Okay, there is a transformed judgment. The fights start, would be looking at the belief surrounding why you would judge such a thing. And again, very often they lead back to your willingness to judge yourself rather than grant yourself validity. And if you have a particular set of standards of what you feel to be your own integrity and after setting them up, consistently breach them. One of the ideas that will result in self-judgment. So you may also look at your own degree or level or definition of personal integrity and use your willingness to judge yourself as the barometer for how willing you are to choose according to your integrity rather than quote-unquote against it. Does that make sense? It does mean, and I thank you. It helps a lot. One of my relevant frustrations here was with a friend who would continually judge himself, you know, oh, I'm an idiot. I'm a real asshole. I'm... I'm......scumb. Whatever, you know. And yet, I could not understand why he would continue in this mode. Well, perhaps again, to be able to increase your understanding, look at why you would judge yourself to any degree that you still do. That will give you the insight. The answers that you get will then enable you to share certain ideas with them. But as we have also shared, you cannot be responsible for him. You can be responsible to him by integrating these issues within yourself and then presenting who you are to him, but again, without insisting that he or she need take it. For when you insist that you are being responsible for them rather than to them. When you simply present who you are, you are being responsible to them and for yourself, which is the only one you can truly be responsible for since you create your own reality as well as they. So, his situation now becomes a very interesting symbol for me, which you can look at. Oh, yes. Not should, but you may wish to. That I may......certainly wish, well, why not if it comes into my reality? It's something that is a piece of my particular puzzle. Oh, yes. Well, thank you very much. Have a good time. Sure. Chris, are you? Yes. You have a wonderful little piece to say at the end of your introductory comments there, and you alluded to some little surprise news that will tell me my way, and I know you don't like those and people present, but do you think you can just shake my box and give me a hint? Perhaps the hint would be when you are willing to define your excitement tonight's title, you will find that particular idea is exciting that perhaps you have not allowed to be valid. These ideas are directly accessible in your life, and that will give you, shall we say, a clue? Great. Thank you. I have another question. Oh. I've been reading in book that talks about the Native Americans being fifth dimension emissaries. So... So, can you elaborate on that a little bit? Well, the idea is that particular nuances of the various tribes within your Native American culture, never quite in that sense, chose to experience the full degree of limitation, that is, shall we say, most common upon your planet? And therefore they walked simultaneously into reality. Great. Thank you very much. And to you. Sure. For sure. Peace. I've done a lot of reading about energy, organ energy, the Oric Force, Mauna, Prawn, etc. This type of energy craps up in all cultures, all over the world. But yet it's pretty much ignored by the scientific community. For the time being, what can you tell me about that energy? Well, the idea is that it is gradations, versions, if you will, of the prime energy of creation itself, which is unconditional love. And there is a direct relationship between the energy of unconditional love itself and all the various manifestations of physicalized energy. Therefore, again, the source of sources, the unconditionally loving white light, so to speak, of all that is or what you label God, would be the place to begin, for they are all stepped down versions of the energy of that consciousness itself. There is the idea that your scientists have been looking at for quite some time. What you would label, the search for a unified field. The unified field is consciousness itself, which springs forth from the unconditional love of creation. Thank you very much. And to you, Shand, is... I've been reading some material on Tesla, and some of the ones that I found that was patented in 1901, I think, was a pre-energy collector. Yes. And it's similar to a solar collector that would be photovoltaic device, except that it's basically a piece of metal that is of what the reflective surface would have insulated on it. And you hook it to a wire that would travel down through a capacitor and through a circuit that would collect the energy and then ground it. I haven't been able to put this together into a circuit. You have to see if it would work. But is this an adequate basis for an energy system? It is the beginnings of the idea of the direct channeling of the electromagnetic field of your planet itself, which again resonates at approximately 7.5 of your cycles per second, approximately. Therefore, there may be the necessity for particular stepping up of that energy once collected. Through other inventions from Tesla, what they were, these... Many of them have worked the more, shall we say, successful ones. Perhaps you will find the information at this time to be inaccessible. But from what is there, there are, shall we say, enough ideas to begin to think along the same lines and develop some of the same lines of approach. Part of what I need to do is I don't have a full understanding of that. I probably need to draw other people to me that would have that information. You already are, and simply be willing when you do, to discuss these ideas to the full limit of your understanding. Thank you. I have another question. Oh, Mr. Shaw, recently in the last week or two, I have been in my dream state. Sometimes I'm not quite sure whether I'm asleep or I'm awake, but I am going through this dream process. There are times when I am awake and actually walking around, but I still feel like I'm dreaming. When I go back to bed, I'm still in that same dream. Part of my consciousness knows that I'm up and walking around, but the other part is still in that dream state. It simply has to do with what we had earlier discussed. The line, the demarcation, which is an artificially imposed demarcation, is beginning by bit to dissolve. And this is simply again a sense of your willingness to begin to live within this dream, thereby not needing to draw the distinction of two different dreams. Some of the things that have been happening in my dreams are things that I'm projecting to happen into my life. I'm trying to draw the conclusion of, I'm looking in this reality when I'm awake and I'm in that reality when I'm asleep. But are the things that I'm trying to make happen in my other reality will it cross over into this reality? Some, yes. Some, to what kind of extent, to what I expect for influence from one to the other. The idea is you will begin to notice within this dream direct reflections from that dream, and for the time being while there is still the separation, there will be a certain portion of reality that you will only choose to experience in that particular aspect of the dream for now. As it breaks down altogether, it will simply be one reality that you will define to be all the waking dreams. So ultimately, I guess you can say it will all shuttle over, but at first, a bit at a time. Thank you. And to you. Sure, for sure. It is. I just want to let you know that a lot of your information has helped me tremendously. I also wanted to let you know that a lot of new exciting things are happening. I have a real basic, simple, fun question to ask you. Oh, not too sure. At some point, within some time, will I become involved in a new relationship? What is your perception? I knew you were going to say it as a man's gift. How can I get with you? I do have my answers. Thank you. Well, thank you for providing it as well as the question. Not fair. If you say so, from our perspective, it is more fair to re-empower you to answer your own questions, or as we have also shared, when you ask a question, you already can pay the answers. Otherwise, when we rendered it and you agreed with it, how do you know? Thank you. And to you for your willingness to continually interact with us on this level and begin to validate your own information. And remember anything you actually hear coming from what you perceive to be this channel is already what you contain, or you would not hear it. There would simply be nowhere to file it, and it would make no sense. So if you can understand it, thank yourself for containing it. Sure. Yes. About a year and a half ago, I had asked you, if you knew if the child that was going to have was going to be male or female, you pretty much responded to me the same way that you responded to me. So thank you again for your consistency. For consistently noticing how consistent we are, and your consistent willingness to answer your own questions. By the way, were you right? Yes, I was. Thank you. And to you, we will share again in a future day. Shitting. For sure. It's worth reading so much. And to you, please. And thank you for your assistance. And I'm stopping here to say that I don't want tonight to pass without saying thank you for more than a year and some months of very good input. Not only has it been interesting, but it has worked. The interaction will continue in this form, but as well on a more direct level. Thank you. That's all. As you knew, that was. Sure. Over there. Then there. This is the first time that I've been here, so I don't really know what's going on. This is my first time. There is a puzzle that I... And by the way, you do know what's going on. Simply do not judge your own knowledge by the standards of others and do proceeds. Thank you. There is a mystery that I've been following for years concerns the cattle mutilations, some four to five thousand of the past eleven years. And I get the impression that you, for your society, your planet, your people, whatever are monitoring us or observing us. And I wondered if you could shed any light on this mystery. Our particular society is not directly involved in those types of interactions, and it's simply not the definition that we define ourselves to be. Understand that some portion of these mutilations are done by members of your own society. However, there is a portion that is in that sense done by another society, interacting with yours for what you might say the purposes of exploration. The purposes of particular observation of your world. And there are specific questions. Yes. We attended a UFO conference recently, and they had a rather extensive talk about this. There's never been any tracks found around these mutilations. There's never been any predators that have... By the way, around some of them, there have others, the ones that we are saying are quote unquote genuine, have not, but do proceed. The incisions have been surgical, done with a very hot, very sharp object. Certain specific parts of the bodies have been taking parts of the lower jaw, the sexual parts, the anus, and things like that. All of the blood is gone, even in the capillaries, there's no tools left in the heart. There's no tracks around any of these bodies. Nobody seems to be able to figure this out. I'm just wondering if you have any insight into this. You say that certain parties in cooperation with us or on their own have done some of these things. I'm very curious about this, and I wondered if you could perhaps... Well, again, briefly, we have already shared that this part of this is the process of observing your particular world and the life upon it. And that particular set of interactions have to do with one particular civilization that is also in direct contact with the peoples of your society, some of them anyway, and is part of the research, so to speak, that is occurring. There is far less of an occurrence of it, and you will see it begin in that sense to disappear. So you're not going to name names then? Well, the idea is one of the civilizations that partakes of that style of exploration stems from the Zeta reticulum star system, and are also similarly beings that are involved with what you label. Abduction, which we prefer to call temporary detainments. Thank you. It is not our society, in particular, and again, being that it is not our particular style of approach, shall we say, although we validate and understand the purposes of it, we do not... All right, condone it. But we understand the purposes behind it. Does this answer the question? Uh, somewhat. Of the many civilizations that are interacting with your society, those interactions are simply the result of one of them, and the others involved again, although they are aware that it is going on, do not condone it. It is only that one particular civilization that does it. We realize that is a bit vague, but that is the most we can share at this time. Thank you. And you as well. Jim, for sure. In the earlier you had said that with the relationship between epsilon, serials, and earth, that serials represented your future self, in a sense. Remember, this is all symbolic. Okay, what relationship does serious have to our origins? Is there... The best answer we can give, and again, we apologize if it seems a bit vague and gentle, and more of a future idea than a past relationship. Okay, so perhaps a present and a future idea. Okay, so more of that are not embodied per se. Yeah, that's why it would be more your future self is that when you move into the fifth density reality in your future. Their particular civilization from our perception is fifth, sixth, and seventh density, which largely represents non-physical existence of consciousness. We are fourth transitional fifth. You are third transitional fourth, so there is a gradation all the way, quote unquote, up, not meaning better, simply higher vibration. And the relationship stems between our relationship with you and your relationship with them, and you do have the ability to communicate directly. If you were to bring back a symbolic representation, you would in that sense perceive them to be beings of life. Beth, as we... Thank you. Sure. Is... The... The crop circles are those palladiums. There is some involvement from the Pleiadian civilizations with some of those symbols. There are other, shall we say, overtones which we will not discuss. But the idea is, there are certain characteristics of the ones that are, quote unquote, authentic, and it is quite obvious in that sense which ones are and are not. There are, shall we say, quite a few copies. Could you give us a hint perhaps as to the meaning of the symbology or one aspect of the symbology? And simply that each one is self-referential, a pictogram of sorts, and each one contains the ability to, quote unquote, crack the code. Once you do, you will discover it. But the timing of your deciphering of these ideas is very crucial to the timing of the point where our respective civilizations can interact. And perhaps you can say it is a bit of a postcard, so to speak. Terrific. Some of the first communications will occur through those understandings. Okay, the... that's pretty neat. We taste those. At least the real ones are pretty neat. The copies aren't quite interesting as well. But I think quite, quite literal there. The copies involve footprints and imagination, a long debris between the various sectional symbols, whereas the authentic ones are very clean. We understand. It though. Yes, I think so. Oh, shit! I have two questions. Recently, not too long ago, there was a, in the Midwest somewhere, a crop circle that formulated overnight some on some farmless land. And now you have some unknown military vehicles, somehow a Tae-Mon and a Bifolian in the crop circle. Do you have any information on this? Not any specific information other than the idea that these quote unquote cover-ups will in that sense begin to cease soon. Why did they, in essence, go to the trouble of trying to defoliate a coded message? Why? I don't know how to ask them. Or. Perhaps a letter will be a beginning place. The second question I have is, recently I've been, when I go to sleep, I go to sleep with the willingness to communicate with other civilizations. And I want to ask if I have been involved in doing that. Yes, but the timing of the remembrance upon quote unquote, waking is significant. Therefore, when you need to, you will have certain realizations that certain things have occurred. Also understand that many of the experiences that are had in that particular reality simply have no point of reference in this reality to compare it to. So it becomes a bit difficult to bring it back as a memory because the framework is simply outside the framework of your current understandings within this physical exploration. So the actual experiences are actually non-physical in and of themselves and simply have no physical counterpart. So therefore you will generally bring them back as the shadow of what actually occurred, a particular, for instance, physical explanation. That is, shall we say, only vaguely reminiscent of what occurred. Can you give me a sort of an answer to some of the civilizations that I have been involved with? Well, perhaps we can simply share that when you interact with our discrete civilization, your particular style of bringing it back as a memory involves a currency that happened within what you might have been involved with. What happened within what you might label, park-like settings. Do you understand? Park-like settings? Yes. Not really. Simply then pay attention and when you bring back a memory of a dream that seemed to occur in a park or a field, that will be remissant all occurrences without civilization. Okay. And that is a symbol that you use to bring it back with, which is only, shall we say, partially representative of the experience. But it will do with an analogy to point it out to bring it to your attention. That's good. I'll win. One more. One more. Is that all? That's it. And shit. A lot. Regarding the Hump's act of way of which appears to be the only way all that really exists, why should this be? The idea is many do. Some, it has simply not been discovered, or shall we say they do not do it when others are around. Others will, again, communicate into the range of perception that is beyond your physical senses. But they are not the only ones. I see, I see. What are the functions of the way also of? Various ideas from communication to the actual producing of what you would label their version of music. They sing. So it is singing, it's communication, and it's location finding, I presume, can be either or both. Or all simultaneous. It is. Great. Thank you. And to you. Shit. For sure. Over there. That's it. Good day. As you knew, cruising, and painting. Actually, a couple of questions. One was about the dolphins. You had said at one time that on your planet, when you became enlightened, it took three days that someone had come with a message. Well, the idea is when we linked up at the society. We never had quite the exploration of limitations that your society embarked upon. By definition, we started out, shall we say, a bit less focused by choice. And what is called here on earth is Christ's consciousness. Yes, our, shall we say, remnant word for it is, shakana. Do the dolphins have something similar? In a sense, yes. What's, how did that come about? Or do you know, or do you share it? The idea is more the direct tapping into that portion of their mass consciousness without the need for a particular individual physiological body. Oh, okay. So they just have somebody come and sign across. Oh. Okay. My other question deals with. I had a thought this afternoon. It was about you, and I was thinking about you when I went, oh, what about anyone? Is she actually your sister for it? No, not in the way that you mean physiological sibling. No. What you may say is that she is a counterpart in a sense that shares the same over soul as I did. I, that's your. Because my, my thought was, you know, can you give me a number? And what was it believe was? We didn't give her the number, but cannot give you hers. I actually felt the presence, and it was, it was just wonderful. And I got this stroking sensation on my back, and I went, oh, hi. Oh, that direct touch, by the way, is indicative of direct communication. Okay. Thank you. That's all for now. I also understand that there is the female counterpart to Elan, and again, she, so to speak, will channel through these interactions. Upcoming. Okay. I'll be waiting. And you. All of it. My question was also about communication. Again, forgive my naivety. This is the first time that I've experienced anything like this. In a way, you know exactly what you need to know. And you do not need to invalidate your particular positions. I'll never mind that. My question is, assuming that this is all very real, I would assume that people from your civilization, planet, whatever, are trying to contact our civilization, even if only out of curiosity. And I'm wondering how one goes about contacting somebody from your society. First of all, understand that we are not trying in that sense to communicate with your society, shall we say, mechanically or technologically. Our particular understanding is that the most sensitive transceiver, which is a transmitter and a receiver built into one, is not indeed a mechanical byproduct, but a biological byproduct. Your consciousness is one of the most conducive transceivers available. Therefore, our particular style of communication is mind to mind, so to speak. And the idea is though we utilize technology, much of it has to do with sympathetic vibrational resonance. Similar to the idea that you label upon your planet whereby you take a particular tuning fork, you hit another tuning fork of the same frequency, and you will notice the first one will resonantly vibrate with it without an actual connection. That is similar, it is a, shall we say, shadow analogy of the type of process. Identifying and harmonically resonating with the particular vibration of consciousness and attunement process of consciousness. Direct identification. Does that make sense? Well, yes and no. All right. How so? No. Well, I understand what you're saying about resonance and vibration and sympathy and this kind of thing, but I would assume that your race is curious about our race. I mean, about our physicality, which you mentioned earlier. And so there must be some sort of desire at some level on your part or your racist part to communicate, experience us. Well, in a sense, when we embark upon these interactions, we have direct access to the mentality of the channels through which we in that sense communicate. So therefore, we can glean whatever in that sense is interesting to us to explore one of the ways directly through the channel. Thank you. All right. I'm just real curious. I mean, here I am sitting and talking to somebody from another planet. You know, I mean, this is pretty strange. I mean, I'm pretty much skeptic, you know, and I'm also open minded at the same time. I'm just trying to get a handle on what I'm dealing with here. Well, the idea is other civilizations will be the first to communicate face to face with your civilization, not ours. And perhaps these will be the ones that you will attract yourself to be able to communicate with that can answer those style of questions more directly. Simply whatever it is we need to know, we through synchronicity attract the opportunity to know it. And it can be again directly through a channel or transceiver that we choose and agree to interact with. So we have no choice at this end. Well, the idea is you have ultimate choice. The reason there has not been face to face interaction, as that there has not been a mass invitation. One of the things that you can pretty much well rule out is that any of the societies have a mal intention. Otherwise, simply they would have done it and gotten it over with already. Not waiting for you to develop elaborate technology and weaponry to make it more difficult in that sense. But the idea is there is a non-interference directive, so to speak, in full force between all the societies that are in contact with your society. And simply we are waiting for the idea of a mass invitation. First step will be the dissemination of the information that already is existing upon your planet by individuals, by your government, into the mass stream. And when this occurs, which by the way will be very facilitated within your next decade, they are actually consciously going to begin disseminating some of this information. That will at least give individuals the choice to decide to invite us if they wish. When you do, and if in fact that you do, we do not insist that you must, then you will begin to see more blatant, shall we say, physical eyes proof of our existence. Right now, what I want to do is to serve your welcome. Thank you. Oh, thank you very much. Shady. Good. Could you tell me if there was any error? So terrestrial, the distance or influence to the earth during the north are flood, and if so, what civilizations may have been interested in? From our perspective, it was more shall we say, as your biblical literature states, direct communication with all that is, and not so much an extra terrestrial source. That does not mean there was not a form of observation of the process, but shall we say it occurred direct? Did a God did any beings from serious have anything to do with assisting the earth during a holocaust or some kind of a holocaust of that nature? In that particular instance, no. In that particular instance, no. In that particular time. Yes, but that would relate a little more, and it is very tangential, not direct, by the way, to Atlantis itself. It is somehow, you not to know the flood? So to speak. Oh, it's like. Being that that particular landmass wound up completely submerged. Every landmass, or shall we say almost completely? There are portions of it still above water, and what you label your Bahama area, particularly one moment. Bit money. And you. One moment. There will be but a few minutes left to this interaction. Shouldn't. Speaking of skeptics, I recently sent a tape out to a friend that I cited that tape, but the response was, at this point, always nothing new than this. Oh, how exciting, how wonderful. Understand, it does excite us if individuals simply take what we are saying and strive. I think. It means they understand it, and perhaps, perhaps are applying it. Remember, we need not convince anyone, nor do we feel our information to be compelling that you must take it. We do not feel what we are sharing is any better than what you are doing. Simply an alternate approach. We realize the individuals that will be attracted to it will be most served by it, and there will be individuals who will not seem to be served by it. And they simply will have less relevance to these interactions altogether, and also have their own particular style and way of proceeding. That is just a valid. Oh, why was I was going to ask? I don't know if I should ask. Oh, dude. I can tell a few new things. For instance, perhaps something about animals, not necessarily, or civilizations you've encountered recently. Ha ha. Something you've never heard before. We have described to you a particular set of beings, though only once, that exist in a spherical form. These particular beings exist in another dimension altogether. There is not a great degree of commonality between that focus of physical mess and yours. We have described that they are spherical in nature, and have what is the equivalent, though this is quite colloquial, of eyes around their entire body. They are able to integrate the field of vision to have a 360 degree spherical perception of vision, rather than the, shall we say, rather, front-sided type of vision that you possess. This has the interesting occurrence of allowing those individuals to truly experience themselves as the center of all things. The idea is that these particular beings exist on a planet whose atmosphere, for lack of a better term, is a bit thicker than yours, and therefore they literally float within the atmosphere of their planet. When two of those beings interact with each other, loosely speaking, it is though there are two centers interacting to form a common third interaction or center. They, in that sense, have what you would label a telempathic communication between them and can between different individuals in that society shift their perspective so that they can, shall we say, switch places consciousness-wise and experience the different central point. Will that do? Thank you. That's, uh, wondrous. As you do as well. Sh I'll not name, but you will find out about it in some form according to your media from our perception. That occurrence may be a doorway or an opening of the beginning of the mass dispersion of the knowledge of the existences of the various societies in contact with yours at this time. Will that do? Yes, and will people in general, like, anywhere on the streets of planet Earth, be able to go up and say, hello, how are you doing coming for a cup of coffee? No, not at that time. It will start far more as one localized event that will have, shall we say, a rippling effect, and then individuals which attracted themselves the knowledge of that particular occurrence will then demand, shall we say, more information, and it will begin an exchange with the government. This will allow that, shall we say, accelerated dispersion of much information, again, more likely to occur in the odd years of this decade, 1993, 579. Thank you very much. And to you. At this time, allow us to once again thank you all for your willingness to begin to define your excitement. Begin to hone in specifically on what it is that truly moves you. It doesn't move you for no reason. It doesn't move you to tease and taunt you. It doesn't move you to dangle a carrot or a gold ring that you can never reach. You can create that reality or you can understand that it moves you for a reason. If you will begin when being moved, so to speak, by it, to move in action with it, this will become most obvious. Again, we thank you for your willingness to express your unconditional love to us and co-create these interactions as equal sharers. This is always how we perceive you, and shall we say one of the other reasons for the, shall we say, hesitant timing of the meetings of our civilizations is one of the aspects of the math invitation that we speak of will be your willingness to view us collectively as equals, though there may be a difference in technological development, expansion of particular focus of consciousness. We are all always equal. No matter how much individuals may hold us up, we always hold you at the same level. When you will simply treat us with the same respect and realize there is nothing to be in all of, we are simply individuals like you are. We have a life, we have a body, we have a planet, perhaps we have spacecraft instead of cars, but that does not make us better. You are also evolving in this direction and will also, from our perception, have such spacecraft. Therefore, for your willingness to interact with us in this format as an equal, we thank you. We wish you a most fond and ecstatic life dreams and dream lives and good evening.
