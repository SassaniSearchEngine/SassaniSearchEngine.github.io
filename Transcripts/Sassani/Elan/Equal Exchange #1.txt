 All right, I'll say how are you all this evening of your time as you create time to exist? Oh, thank you very much. Allow us to entitle this interaction, equal exchange. And therefore, we will now proceed to questions, sharing, and exchange. Elana. Shame on who prem Goode Ramanna begins this. Hello. You ready? Ah, come on. Let's go to you. like a great serpent. In other parts of the country, there are other mounds different shapes, some diagonal, some appear bare-like, and so forth. Can you tell us anything about the origins of these particular, at least configurations? What was their original purpose? Well, do understand that there are many purposes for these ideas. However, one common theme, in general, when you are to find such a creation in an area whereby there is not, shall we say, a mountaintop to view down and see the idea, then in general, in general, there is some connection to extraterrestrial society. There is, however, also the idea that many of these civilizations had what you would call a very harmonious relationship to nature. So therefore, some may be considered in that sense to represent certain, shall we say, gifts to the gods, so to speak. The idea being that from the perspective of certain societies, gods, were existing above and would have such a view. So it can be either. Well, thanks. Thank you, Alon. Thanks. For the question regarding the pyramids throughout the United States or North American continent, I am the South and Central America, I guess. We have pyramids. Do you seem a very popular shape in a sense? I presume that they first were built in Egypt. Prior to that, Atalandis. And your Egyptian representations, in general, are mere shadows of the original concept of such a structure. There was also, to some degree, though, far less such structures on what you would label, Lemoria. But understand that the colonization of your North American continent has had many roots, many ways. One of the ideas that you call the land bridge between your, shall we say, ex, Soviet Union, and your Alaska was but one root. Other roots were, in a sense, results of the colonization from Lemoria, and then later from Atalandis. And much of the technology would transfer directly to these areas. Therefore, not being, shall we say, related at all to the Egyptian manifestation. I see. Now, I understand the original purpose, at least from our perspective, of these ideas was understanding that they are physically lenses, which focus the electromagnetic field of your planet in a particular way, effectively creating, shall we say, a gateway, a doorway, or what you sometimes may call, loosely speaking, a style of vortex. It was understood by civilizations that a particular orientation, approximately one third of the way down from the top, was the area with which this energy was focused, allowing it to literally be an interdimensional doorway or gateway. So therefore, individuals would utilize these structures in what you sometimes call your medication to travel to other dimensions and also too far taken what you colloquially now label astral travel. This idea was, shall we say, a bit misunderstood by your Egyptian population. And to some degree, they then became tunes for the idea is that the understanding that such a focusing of energy allowed one to quote, unquote, leave their body, then was extrapolated to mean that it would preserve the soul beyond death. But this stemmed from the misunderstanding for, of course, the soul exists beyond death anyway. I see. This would imply, for me, the interesting speculation that in the case of the pyramid travelers, so to speak, the original ones, these guys could appear anywhere in the world and could transport their technology pretty much instantly. In a sense, do understand that the method of travel through these vessels was more or less energy, so they were not literal, trance teleportation devices, though that also exists. I'm sorry. Well, thank you very much. And to you. Shady. You are. Thanks. I have a couple of questions for you. All right. One of which is, can you tell us what future sets on Earth, what it will be like in the near future and the coming future in the next 20, 30 years? Well, to capitalize the overall idea, there will be far less of an emphasis in fulfilling a need and far more simply individuals willing to exchange on many levels. And that exchange, as you begin to move from physicality, shall we say toward a more non-physical state of existence, will eventually assume, shall we say, the presentation of direct energy exchange, direct identification with the individual with which you are sharing. But we will still have the ability to continue with the traditional modes of steps that we have. Oh, yes. It will be a gradient. And never will, shall we say, a particular jump in the style of it be forced upon the civilization. It will simply be that the tool has been, in that sense, played out to the point where the next level of exploration will be endeavored upon. But again, the idea is it will be far more of a sharing of essences as it already can be, and far less of the idea of a physical fulfillment of something that you do not already contain. For understand from our perspective, you already contain it all and need not search outside yourself to bring something in to make you complete. When you recognize your completeness, you will then attract other beings who recognize their completeness. And it will simply be a matter of sharing of, if you will, walking in each other's boots. OK. And my second question is, can you explain the powers of a nuclear receptor, which I believe is a collating in technology? Briefly, the idea is that it is a collector and focus or of energy. If your consciousness is so aligned, this can be quite positive. But again, in terms of utilizing any symbol as a means of protection, we caution you. The reason we do so is for when you set up a protection. What you are telling the universe is that you believe that an attack is most likely. So therefore, you are simultaneously, so to speak, setting up the attack. So if you find the need for protection, that gives you the opportunity to view why. For again, you create your own reality, and nothing can creep into your reality where there is no outside. Though individuals who believe this can create a seeming reality of this occurring, again, we caution the use of anything for protection. And again, utilizing that need to hold down the beliefs that you hold that no longer therapy. OK. You can use the nuclear receptor for more positive. Oh, yes. It is simply a tool and can be used in any way. It is inherently as we can sense a focuser of energy, a mirror in the sense of the energy you choose to focus within it. So again, we suggest not focusing the need for protection within it, and simply utilizing it enjoy, utilizing it, again, to focus particular energies and perhaps tap into those energies as a focusing stone or tool. Now, when you say energy, is for the nuclear receptor be used to tap into other energies of the universe? Oh, yes. But understand, you can already do this within your consciousness. For you do not exist within a reality. Reality exists within you. And when you, in that sense, decide to move on to self-ferenity, that will be one of the first recognitions that allows entrance to the next level of exploration and expanded consciousness. That the reality you previously believed you existed within exists within you. One final question for now. All right. Can you tell us something about the Orion sector, about the Orion conflict that occurred, how they have mended the conflict or have worked on in coming together from that Orion conflict? All right. Briefly, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of years ago. In the system, you would label the Orion system. Was particular planet that, shall we say, exhibited one of the highest degrees within third density of suppression and depression, whereby the indigenous population became so accustomed to it? At some point, they simply knew of no other alternative. There was not even a longing to experience personal liberation, for there was simply not the notion. As will happen in such a reality, though, eventually, individuals reincarnating again and again, within that system began to get all of the idea that liberation was a concept. That personal power was a concept. That equal sharing was a concept. And so arose initially in the form of what you might call a resistance, groups of individuals that began to conglomerate together synchronistically and begin in that sense to begin to project a new way. This, of course, being that it was even phrased in terms of a resistance was highly resisted by the established, shall we say, authority, so to speak. And many individuals understanding that they could simply not escape that suppression, incarnated into different systems throughout the multiverse who were in different, shall we say, stages of integration to be able to amass integrative experience and so to speak, so to speak, beam them back to the civilization which then insisted in a synergistic movement. Now in those systems, there is a balance. And it is shall we say somewhat similar to your own, whereby there is the expression of negativity and separation, but also the expression of love and light and positivity and integration. Therefore, in many ways, they are like you. Though from our perspective, never was your particular exploration as focus in suppression and oppression. Does that answer the question? Yes. The reason why ours was just why was ours not as focused as theirs? It was simply not shall we say the definition of the original exploration. It was quite focused. You are quite masters in the subject of limitation. However, it was not quite the specialized study of suppression itself, though needless to say, there have been many forms of those symbols upon your planet. But generally, there have always been in your society at least some pocket of balance. Well, that's it for now. I'll ask you some others later on. I understand that the incarnation of the Orion energy, as well as some intermixing with societies that you would label as originating from the Pleiades, were responsible for the physical lightning of the skin of your races, for the indigenous population to the Earth, or shall we say the original population to the Earth were the darker skin beings. And so that means our skin being lighter, you're saying that we weren't indigenous to this planet. Well, again, this is all quite colloquial, and indigenous could simply mean anyone who winds up there. But shall we say chronologically was occurring later. Great. Thanks a lot. And to you, Shari. Well, I'm... Hey. We've been channeling with the Barnard star system for the last several weeks. Yes, you are. As we thank you. Well, we appreciate the idea. It was very nice to know of its existence through you and the char. One of the things that we're discovering is the physicality is extremely different than we have, I guess, been led to believe... There has been no leading with simply assumptions based on sparse amounts of information that we shared with your society. But the idea is, even by nature of their very star system, this would need be true. For in general, even within your particular understanding of astronomy and star types, so to speak, your population of scientists assumes that such a star, a red dwarf, could not support life. The idea is life exactly as you are. This is true. Therefore, there are many adaptations, many, many ideas of genetic adaptations that allow for, shall we say, life to spring up in the most unlikely of places. And some of these particular aspects will also have to do with the size and the atmosphere of the planet itself. Would you be willing to share some more information about the star system? We've been in contact with neuron and a variety of the leaders on their planet. And I would find it helpful if you could give us some information about some of the physicalities, some of the common belief systems or explorations that they might be operating under. It would facilitate us in our area of focus of exchanging of information. All right. At this time, however, we find that it would be most helpful. If you would state or synopsis eyes, if you will, your current understanding. Our current understanding is they're humanoid, less than five feet tall. They have a unlike our skin, which is very thin and has a lot of wood. Their skin thickness goes almost through to their whole body. In a sense. Yes. And they have a hair, seems like, not a lot of hair on top of their heads. They are very much into oneness with everything. When we had discussions about anger and some other emotions, they were very curious as to even what these emotions were. So we've been noticing that their physical form, when we went through our chakra system and theirs, they're similar, but there's some very large differences with anatomy and with energy systems. And we've been able to communicate with them through a channel named John. And Joan has been able to communicate with them directly. So can you fly the way? I understand. I've been doing that in Dream State and more in conscious awareness. It has been very interesting discovering a common language that our colors don't even exist the same. Our animals, there's just so much that is alike and different. It's been wonderful. We would not want to spoil the surprise. Is there something specific, however, that you are seeking? More much more will come out from your end. And then, shall we say, in a future interaction, we will comment at some length. Well, what is the size of their planet in relationship to ours? One moment. Approximately 1.15 the size of your planet. 1.15 times the size. And we are currently communicating with a settlement of around 20,000 people. Are there, do you have an idea about how many beings inhabit that planet? Yes. Shall we say, in the low, billion, not the high? And where are they initially? Where is their origin? There's this not on this planet. It is a combination of other solar systems. Right, but do understand this, particularly in their instance, to be a rather arbitrary designation, as you are all eternal. So when you speak of origins, many times you simply mean the last place you have been, but you have done it all. In that particular society, shall we say it is a, so to speak, melting pot of the cosmos. So there is no one particular place through which there was an infusion of mass consciousness. And far more, if you wish, all right, the grand central station of that area. And do they have life forms that live in the sea that are conscious as our dolphin whales? The idea is there is some indigenous population in what you would label their equivalent to the water, but they would be more likened to your animal consciousness. And to you. Sharing. Greetings. And to you, good day. I just wanted to add one more question to Ted's questions about the pyramid. Oh, right. Somewhere I had heard or read that maybe there are some pyramids, maybe that have the ratio of one side to another, let's say, of the parameter I 3.1416. And you confirm that that does exist? Yes, it does. And your Egyptian periods are one of the closest to the original designation. There's some significance to that being the ratio. Not at all. I see. That is a joke. Obviously, for there is the idea of the infinite symbol of the circle. And we will stop there and allow you to explore that further. OK. Thank you. Now, I really wanted to ask about electromagnetic forces or fields, if you will. Do share. There's been a growing concern in this country. And most recently in Long Island, especially in the state of New York, that somehow certain diseases, and I guess it's cancer, maybe especially in women, might be somehow caused by electromagnetic forces or fields. It is possible, but will be strongly dependent on the belief systems of the individuals and the polarization of the electromagnetic energy itself. And it's not a clockwise counterclockwise. So, but again, if one were in that sense to simply not contain that belief, it would have no effect. So, primarily, the individuals who would feel such an effect do so due to particular belief, which is true with anything you experience in your physical reality. As you well know, our scientists are always looking to colorate color, well, I'm not saying that right, data. Right. Curly. Curly. Curly. Well, not cause and effect. And they will be doing that for a long time. For the idea of cause and effect occurring in that direction is quite valid. However, it is not the only idea. You can literally create the effect first, and then have the cause for that effect. Consciousness speaking, you can simply decide to create the effect of being happy. Then all the causes for that happiness will then follow. So, it is two sides, but of one coin. Just back to whatever you act out can indeed cause that to be the case in your reality. And understand again that all belief systems contained within the self-perpetuating system of logic, a self-perpetuating system of evidence. So therefore, it will always follow suit according to the original initial belief. Well, we have an expression. If I know what answer I'm trying to come up with, I'll find a way to get there through the mathematics or whatever. That is more accurate than you might imagine. There are statistics available to prove any idea. I wanted to ask you about the nature of electromagnetic. We commonly say electromagnetic waves. I just saw the title of an article recently where this fellow was claiming that it's neither a wave nor particle. In a sense, you can understand it to be either both or neither. It's nice to be flexible, I guess. The universe always is. Well, that's all I have right now. Thank you. Well, all right. Again, we have reminded you that were you to take even your sine wave, which is a two-dimensional representation, and rotate it 90 degrees, you would be looking into a spiral. So that is one of the ways that electromagnetic energy is represented. But understand that everything is comprised of it. So there are many different forms depending upon the frequency and the relationships of frequencies within any given manifestation. One last question, if I may, or out from the Earth, does our electromagnetic field that surrounds the Earth, how far out does it go? Tens of thousands of miles. There is some interaction with what you would label your electromagnetic field of your Earth and the solar wind. Also, all, shall we say, planetary bodies or spheres, have such electromagnetic configurations, which vary as they, in that sense, revolve around your central stars. And they interact with each other, so to speak. Your very orbit is the result, the arbitrary path of your planet, is the result of a standing wave, so to speak, of electromagnetism, of the sun itself, in a sense. Thank you very much. And to you. Shady. Hey. Hold on. OK. Everything. OK. I buried a rag a while back, and it worked. All right. Perhaps you wish to expand for those who have no idea what you are talking about. OK. Yeah. I had some words on my hands. The shaft, first of all, recommended bearing a rag I did, and there was just one left. So the final one I got rid of, there was some, I did pick it a bit, but it didn't come back. So now, no. All right. Thank you for enhancing the symbol. So what was the idea? There are many. But first of all, understand that we have stated many times that what you believe is what you will experience. So primarily, your willingness to believe a particular idea allowed you to demonstrate to yourself just how literally this is so. Now, interestingly enough, it took an external source presenting that idea for you to decide to have enough trust in it to allow it to occur. But there is more symbology than simply that. First of all, understand. There is the concept of grounding yourself within your physical reality and digging a hole within your Earth is one way to symbolically do this. Also, in that sense, connecting with the Earth itself, intermashing with the substance of the Earth itself is an aligning process. Understand, if you will, that the rag is a symbol of an outer covering, if you will, layers of the onion, the center of which is your consciousness. And therefore, it's symbolic of your willingness to begin to shed those layers, which no longer serve you, and in that sense, ground your idea to the physical reality. Now, understand, the reason that there were many manifestations were because there were many ideas that you were exploring. When you did that the first time and, in that sense, conglomerated many of these ideas to one single point of focus. You follow along so far. Oh, then you allowed yourself, after looking at many issues, for this was also the process of many of the beliefs that you process in between, and the timing is no accident, particularly with the cycles of your mood. That allowed you to transform, finally, that entire idea. But do understand, again, that you can decide what it is you wish to believe. And you can decide, without an external validation, what it is you wish to do. Whenever you wish to change a belief, you do not simply state the new belief, and then march on as though the old belief never existed. That is denial, and the old belief still exists. What is the difference between denial and literally changing your belief is first acknowledging your belief. Your beliefs which are unconscious were bought into, shall we say, automatically. But the moment the opportunity arises to view one of them, even one and particularly one that you do not prefer, it's conscious. And that process of taking a belief that you chose unconsciously and making it conscious equalizes it to all other beliefs. Allows you to literally have it all out on the table and pick whichever belief you want. And then your willingness to formulate how an individual with a new belief would act, and act that way yields the new effect. You acted that way. You expected a particular result. You in that sense did not settle for anything less than that result, and you got that result. Does that explain? Yeah, it does. You sound disappointed. No, no, no, no. Okay, thank you. Oh, is that all? Yes, for now. For now. There is a little bit more upon this, but when you will share, then so will we. Yeah, I know. Thank you. Oh. Shitting. Hey. I want to ask a little bit about the ties into the protection that you were talking about earlier. I want to ask a little bit about insurance. All right. In general, I'm going to say car insurance as a more specific example. How do you take responsibility for what you create with or without insurance? If you have it or you don't have it, what do you say about insurance? We are not sure we understand the overall concept you are seeking to explore. Yeah. Now understand, in that particular instance, it falls within the law of your planet, of your society. Well, not in all states. All right. What are the questions? So if you don't have insurance, or if you choose, say you choose, you don't want to have insurance, and you have an accident at some point, basically what I want to know is, how can you have insurance and not let that be just like a protection thing, such a suggestion that you're going to have an accident or that you will have an accident, that you could have an accident. You're eating that shit. The same way with protection, you need to think you're having protection and there must be something you need to protect yourself. Well, very often understand that individuals obtain such an idea, not because of protection, but because of the law. That is why we mentioned that. So therefore, it will depend on the reason in that way for choosing it. If the reason is for protection, in general, individuals will, again, provide the reason for the need for that protection, so they do not feel that they wasted the money. Right. Okay. Because, like, we're around, you don't have to have car insurance. Oh. I'm tying into something that I don't have insurance, and as you know, we talked in the private session that I had, I met a gentleman by accident a few weeks ago, and I'm going to have to pay out my pocket, which is okay because it's about what my insurance would have cost me. Oh, how creative? But you understand that individuals that choose not to partake of such a symbol, but still believe they need the protection can get a similar result. So therefore, get in touch with your truest belief. And understand the reasons for why you did not choose such a symbol, which is, again, in general, the law in your land, was it because of a sparsity mentality? I just didn't think it was a good investment. Oh, same thing. Right. I am thinking about giving insurance companies money. What if... I don't want that accident to cause me to believe that I now need protection, because I'm of insurance. Is there anything you can help me with in that area? Yes. Simply, again, look at the beliefs that you do have. Do not deny any of the beliefs, because they are beliefs that you do not prefer to have. And drive carefully. Mm-hmm. I want to ask a little bit about the gentleman that I had the accident with. You mentioned in the private session I had that same day with you, that he was going to go through some kind of an adjustment due to the meaning by accident. Hey. I've been with you since, and he's been fine, but I just wanted to say anything that you can tell me about, yeah, but what happened? In general, these adjustments will be subtle consciousness oriented adjustments, and you would not necessarily, not knowing the person fully notices. But in general, when individuals are utilizing one of your more blatant symbols of acceleration, sometimes they will stop themselves short, and sometimes they will utilize the particular, shall we say, trauma, if you will, as an opportunity to literally rewire your brain. That is not the only way to do it, but that is one. A blow on the head, and you will generally find many individuals who are psychically tuned, or channelers, or whatever you wish to ascribe a label, as having at some point in their lives had a sharp blow to the head. Is there is chest pain after the accident? We did not so much mean the physical manifestation, and particularly in your own instance of rewiring, we're seeking consciousness. Right. All right. Wanted to ask you about a dream I had at the other night. This, this instant, this baby started to talk to me. Oh, very good. You are getting in touch. And it started to ask me these metaphysical questions, and it almost like it was chilling, it had an accident. And then it started to tell me that I had been preparing to, and will be preparing to travel 500 years into the future. All right. How exciting. You are communicating directly in a very creative fashion with the child within. Therefore, you can understand that child is alive and well, and has information to offer of its own. You can access this level of your consciousness anytime you wish. Yeah, the energy seemed very familiar. Very comfortable. Have a good trip. It's funny, and my mother was in the dream and she looked surprised at it. Are you going somewhere? We'll be up to you. Anything else you can fill me on those counterparts since that ties into the future, the counterparts that we've discussed several times on other interactions. You will experience, particularly within the next three months of your time, what you might call flashes of awareness. These flashes pay particular attention to them. They represent, shall we say, glimpses into some of these other realities. After these occur, we can then expand upon that idea. But that will enable you to get in touch with these counterparts, literally. They will also be experiencing such a flash from their end at the same time. So you can understand at that time there is a direct synchronization. That's the other question I had about that. Is my dreams or fantasies of future become influenced by them and also in both ways? Participated within by them, not influenced, so to speak. Or you can never truly be influenced unless you decide to perform the action and then label that it was from influence. And last thing I wanted to ask you, I don't know if you can access this information or not, but I need a name of one of the entitlements of the Bashar section in 1987 where someone composed some music from Bashar and played it during the interaction. And he, the whole time had a whole orchestration of body movements that went along with each and every music. Is it possible to get the entitlement of that? I know I have it on videotape, but I can't find it. I'm gonna make it. That's a copy for Andrew. We find at this time that there is not within the memory of the channel enough of those titles. Can you name a few? Yeah. I'm Paul Manocasana. Peace card. It doesn't really want to say come to mind. It is our initial perception that it is neither of those. However, you may wish to check it out. Alon. Alon, is that all? Yes, that's all. And we thank you as well. Shredding, yes. Alon. Recently I've had several indications that the A- A- A- A- A- A- A- Are you discounting what has occurred over the past two years? Well, what's two years? That's a decent amount. How cool? But it didn't. The, I did have, by the way, two sharp blows to my head. Well, well. Oh, how exciting. Again, you do not need to do it that way, but you can't. Thank you. Well, I appreciated that definition. I mean, I thought those blows were in some sense. Along the lines that you are exchanging with us now, we simply suggest utilizing your already existing telephone line and placing the calls. Any other connections can be made from the switchboard on the other end. I understand. But specifically, my situation is that I'm feeling influxes, wonderful influxes, influxes from a whole variety of different directions. Oh, not in two. Yeah. And the key to going around. Occasionally, I have trouble establishing priorities. You have? What? Well, I have an interesting situation in establishing priorities. Perhaps the difficulty lies in your willingness to simply not judge and simply validate what you get. There's still a little bit of that. Oh, it's just my imagination, even within you. Right. Yes, I realize that. And to be that interesting, it seems over the past six months, especially, I've been on something like a terminal exploration of all kinds of negativity. Oh, well, very often, again, as your awareness expands, you will become more aware of just as much negative as positive. But one of the things in the advanced class that we are sharing right now is that you need not experience the negative, can simply transform any of your relationship to the negative by being willing to remember that all symbols are neutral, and being willing to view how each and every situation, particularly the ones that you initially have the propensity to label negative, how they serve you exactly as they are. Exactly. I've been operating on that basis. One other idea is this. When you have a goal or an overall, shall we say, idea in mind that you wish to experience very often many individuals, rather than concentrating, so to speak, their attention upon what they can do in that direction, fixate and repeat and reaffirm over and over again what it is that they can't do. And then the universe hears, thing that excites me can't do, thing that excites me can't do. Therefore, rather, when you find yourself focusing on what it is you wish to do that you cannot, reground yourself back into the moment and allow yourself to see what you can do. For what you cannot do in any given moment is simply not relevant to that moment. And your willingness to fixate on something which is not relevant to the moment is at the cost of what is right in front of your face. Thank you. I'm Sam. And another word, if I might, about my particular exploration, which I found has become quite interesting. It's almost like a research project. Oh, here's another kind of negativity. How interesting. Oh. And my flash is in anger, having diminished from, say, three days to, well, not quite ten minutes, maybe fifteen or twenty years. Oh, as we have shared from the benefit of those present, true anger is a polarization and alignment. It allows you to see how you stand. In relation to a particular idea that you are exploring, it only lasts, and to fifteen of your seconds. Beyond that, it is judgment and invalidation of the thing that you say you do not prefer. We suggest utilizing the anger to allow you to establish what you prefer and what you do not prefer without needing to then go to the extent of saying what you don't prefer absolutely thinks. Therefore, your willingness to simply discern what you prefer and what you do not without going to the second step of invalidating that which you do not prefer will then allow you to choose what you do and not give extra weight to what you do not. And while may we have your analysis, if you do an analysis anymore, your point of view on the origins of negativity. Well, in a sense, you are speaking about an infinite idea in finite concepts. Is there a specific area that you are searching? I was searching for the, perhaps, the basic situation that might cause negativity to spring forth. So, in a sense, you can say that negativity, in a sense, this is quite colloquial, results from choosing to explore separation from all that is, and judging those separations or any portion of those separations as being less than any other portion. This gives the experience of negativity. I understand perfectly what I see occasionally when I ask that question is the original separation from God, the bursting form. Right, but do understand this need not be interpreted in a negative way. Understand, you cannot view yourself without first removing yourself from yourself. Even in your society to use the analogy, the only way you can, quote unquote, physically view yourself is by creating a separation you call a mirror. Otherwise, you cannot perceive yourself from within yourself, in a sense, does this translate? Yes. Therefore, you can say, in a sense, all that is create separation to be able to then reflect back onto and define itself, so to speak, this is quite colloquial, more from your perspective than, shall we say, the perspective of all that is, but from many facets, many angles, thereby giving a well-rounded view, in a sense. Now, you can experience this as a valid creation without needing in that sense to judge it as negative, but the opportunity arises within the separation itself to begin to understand that different ways can be assigned to the separated portion, which is judgment. All explorations are valid, equally valid. When you as a consciousness grow, you will prefer certain ideas to another. The good news is you get to choose and experience the ideas you prefer. Simply no one has mentioned that in the owner's manual of your growing up. Therefore, there is the notion that you must balance out your 50% positive experience with 50% negative in order to be well-rounded. No, that is one choice. That is as valid as any other choice, but it is not the only way. You can be aware of negativity all around you and never experience one Iota of it, and therefore your contribution within that scenario would be to be a living example of individuals choosing preference, choosing positivity in service of self and service of others, and thereby, again, are a sparkling example of another ulcerative. To experience separation, so to speak, in a more integrated way. Great, great. And before passing, I would like to thank the Francis Farmer Energy for she or it made possible many of my more recent insights. Oh, you made them possible, utilizing that particular portion of your energy as a symbol, but it is understood and you can say in that sense the gratitude is returned. Well, thank you, thank you. You're welcome, you're welcome. And thank you as well. Sure. Alay. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Thank you. Thank you. Hi. Hi. I have a few more questions here. The ASTRART command in one of the tapes that someone else channeled talks about the planetary ascension. Do you also tell us about the role of the ASTRART command right now at this present now moment? In a sense, they represent from our perspective levels of consciousness that are, if you will, extraterrestrial in nature, are piped in at least tangentially into what we call the association of world. And soul function is of a positive, assisted, integrative way, again though, in a non-interferior of fashion. So that energy from time to time will make physical manifestation appearances, but most often will communicate, if you will, through or utilizing the most receptive type of transceiver biological entity. One point, the ASTRART command through another channel talked about evacuation. That is not our particular perspective. And understand that when channeling through biological entities many times, their particular beliefs can color the information. Also understand that there are an infinite number of probable Earths. Perhaps you can say on one of them such an idea exists, but this is not quite as relevant to the Earth that quote unquote we are sitting on right now. You do not need to be saved. Your space brothers will not come down and save you. You are not drowning. You are choosing perhaps somewhat unconsciously at this point, but it becomes more and more conscious. You are choosing to explore this reality in this way. That power of your ability to choose this is respected and considered, if you will, sacrosanct. Bye-bye. I also agree that we are not drowning too. My other question is continuing on with ASTR. He talks about three waves. Can you explain what he means by three waves? Well, there are many interpretations of this. In one sense, one interpretation can be that there are three waves of styles of communication between civilization. From our perspective, the first wave would take the form that you are participating in right now, the idea of communication in this particular format whereby we utilize biological transceivers to attract pockets of individuals that have such interest. That is one. The second wave, so to speak, is physical and in that sense, low key. Therefore, part and parcel of the second wave will also be slowly or perhaps more quickly if you facilitate the dissemination of the information that is already been gathered by what you sometimes label your government. And the third wave, so to speak, could be symbolized by the physical visitation. Once the planet is unified enough to issue an invitation, for we simply do not wish to interfere or invade in any way, shape or form. Our participation with you physically will hinge on your willingness to issue an invitation, particularly on mass. Okay, and what is the state of the mission as of this now moment? In a sense, you can say it is within the midst of the first wave initiating the second. There has been physical contact with your, shall we say, government, and there is visual contact with many of your, quote unquote, ordinary citizens from time to time in the form of what you label, craft sighting. This is a form of communication. It is no accident that a particular individual happens in that sense to partake of the experience of witnessing a craft sighting. Now, going from one end to the other, in terms of the political process that we're in right now in the United States, we have a number of candidates running for a presidential office. And there seems to be many choices in the realm of the political spectrum. How do you see our political process here in the United States on the planet transforming the next year or two? Rapidly, and with shall we say, some sudden shifts. This will occur more in your next year, though there will be much activity in this year as well. There is the possibility for some of the dissemination of the information which we previously mentioned, mid-year of this year, and as well mid-year of next. Okay, and one final question. Why did certain people, during Atlantis, stray away from the peaceful co-creation they had at that point? Why did certain parties... Many individuals did, and again, it was part and parcel of the idea of imposing more and more of a forgetfulness upon themselves to be able to experience this form of reality. And again, due to feelings of helplessness, individuals will then attempt to force their reality to conform. Believing that control must be grabbed onto, maintained, oppressed, suppressed, which is again generally arising from a feeling of inner helplessness. For the idea is you need not force anything. The mechanism of creating your reality according to preference is allowance. Lightening up, letting go, not grabbing on, holding, hoarding, and attempting to make yourself whole again by utilizing external validation after external validation. Does that answer the question? It seems like all plants have gone through some sense of this in their eons. Well, again, understand there is nothing wrong with it. Any exploration is valid, and therefore, when a particular opportunity for a particular exploration arises, it allows many individual consciousness to decide to experience such a thing. So if a particular individual wishes to experience a particular form of negativity, there's a planet that has it. So a planet in this sense has experience, it seems like a lot of negativities in it. A lot of positivity as well. Though in the particular orientation of your media, that is in general not newsworthy. Therefore, you have a rather distorted view of your overall society from our perspective, if you wish, from our perspective, if you were to ascribe positive and negative, our particular, again, perception. It is only our perspective, is that you would sense 70% positive, 30% negative. It seems now that we're overall processes that we are dealing with our situations on the planet in a more honest manner, and that we are looking towards a more positive, 100% positive future for the many generations beyond us. At some point, and this will, in a sense, usher in what you sometimes call the new millennia. We receive this to be ushered in anywhere within the next 30 to 50 of your years. Though individuals can experience this right now. Okay, that handles those questions for now. I have a few more about hold-off on. All right, we thank you for your willingness to dive into these ideas. All right, allow me, therefore, to pause for a short break and resume contact in 10 to 15 minutes of your counting.
