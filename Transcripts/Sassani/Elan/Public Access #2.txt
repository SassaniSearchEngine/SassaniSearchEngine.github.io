 All right, I'll say before we continue a few coming attractions. Not that we find an advantage, not to take away from the spontaneity of the moment, but sensing the energy present right now, there will be the opportunity in your upcoming year for a few additions to these interactions. One idea which we have already touched a little bit upon will be the idea of the introduction of other consciousness. When a land is in full implementation in that sense, being again that that is the original agreement made, there will be a very conducive conduit for the imparting of information from some other stream. Another individual upon our planet of Eftisani, a female, also the idea of some communication from what you would label, theory, stream of consciousness, and as well from time to time, in particular perfect timing, some communication from what you label, reticul. As well, if it is so desired by the channel, there will be the opportunity to have what you might label, a seminar style of format, what you sometimes call workshops, what we prefer to call playhouse. For now that will be. Allow us before we continue to again remind you that this is not an ending. This is a changing and alteration, a shift, but it is truly a new beginning. Will therefore again from the next interaction on, there will be many new ideas that are sharing. Shady, please. I want to ask you about how do you align your personality self and personal goals and things you think you want to create in your reality with your higher will or the bigger picture or the higher plan that's happening. How can you, it seems that certain things manifest, the other things that you are protected from manifesting because they are not serving your higher self or will. How can you get those two aspects of yourself? Much of it has to do with truck in timing and also understanding that what is available in each and every moment are options that are from the free will of the higher self. So simply function with what you've created, allowing it to be most obvious what is right in front of you, choosing from that and then you will dovetail as you say one idea to the other. When we discuss the idea of the high free will of the higher self, again understand that this only occurs in the most generalize of the it is not specific. So therefore it will always be up to the free will of the physical self in how to experience any of these very generalize themes, the specifics. But again to bring it all back to the very bottom line of the things that we discussed. Choosing with your excitement from what is available is that alignment. Viewing and allowing yourself to see what is available is that alignment. And then choosing and refusing to choose what is not representative only choosing what is is as well an alignment. Literally by determining your excitement and then acting upon it you are aligned in that moment. And if you continue to do so you remain aligned. But it is not that the free will of your higher self does not allow you to experience certain things. You can by simply having the desire understand that that is not held from you. And again in that instance may just simply be a matter since you have created a reality that contains time. And one of the definitions of what you experience within the timeline is unfolding of having a perfect trust that whatever is in each moment is what you need. And the things that you desire that are not are simply forthcoming unfolding. Trust in timing choosing from your excitement. That is the simple words that we can give. So there are times when you may think you want something to manifest or whatever it is and it doesn't and you find out later that maybe it wouldn't have served you or wouldn't have. At that time if you truly desire you will maintain that desire. If you do not judge the timing you will then find when that particular idea manifests an interesting thing occurs. Certain things occur between the time you felt it should have manifested and the time that it does that give you more of the capability more knowledge more resources to fully appreciate the thing you desire. So that is the trust in timing. And again understand when you are saying I doubt my time you are simply trusting in a negative sense it is still a trust not a lack of trust. Now if it doesn't manifest maybe you've lost interest in it or you. Well again if you desire it will manifest and always in the perfect time to be able to fully relish it. That does not mean that many things cannot be immediate. And again paradoxically the things that accelerate the fastest any of these things are doing what it's actually for again excitement is a thread that leads to all of the things and very often when individuals begin to do the things that do not excite them they side steps and it's side stepping as more time. So therefore you can accelerate it quite greatly. Eventually things will seem to be quite immediate but at first there is shall we say an inherent need to trump the timing for then you don't allow yourself to be thrown off center and you keep your eyes open to see when the opportunity does arise. So perhaps you can say at first when you begin to take conscious responsibility for creating your life at first you can define that you can have anything that you want though not necessarily at first when you want. But as you begin to live this way you will find more and more it will even be when you want it. But there is an old momentum and an old non-truck in timing that has a momentum as well. Well there are any times where you think you want something and it doesn't manifest in a way that you really wouldn't have enjoyed it or wouldn't have. Yes that doesn't occur. But again if you truly desire it do not think it will be held from before if you do that as a belief and you are the one dangling the carrot. They wish there is something else. We have discussed with you the idea of a dream when we last interacted with you recall. We had mentioned to you that this was a future occurrence. Do you recall? Yes I do. We meant that figuratively as well as literally for the craft that you perceive was in a sense an earth craft from your future. Understand that some portion perhaps what you would label a small portion of what you label to be identified are actual crafts from your own future. Also understand that it is not literally your own future is a parallel future time dress. For the moment you go back quote unquote into your own past you are not truly going into your own past you are sliding across to a parallel idea and creating or skewing off in a sense an experience of a different parallel reality altogether. What did you bring that up? Simply because there is an unfoldment in our presenting of it to you and we let that out last time on our own. One last question. How do you have a totally unconditional loving intimate relationship without being overly needy or dependent and still be okay if that person would be gone tomorrow? It has much to do with how you define relationships. Our idea that we share is to allow relationships to be what they are and allow yourself to glean what they are what they provide what you create but there is very often in your society rigid expectations that they must feel a certain idea. Much of this again stems from feeling incomplete to begin with or if you truly understand and nurture your primary relationship there is no needy nest. There is simply a sharing an unfoldment again of a timing and an understanding that when a relationship changes it still exists. It simply has changed its definition and also if it is a relationship that you desire and it changes form it is in general making way for a relationship that will now be reflective of the new youth or you are always constantly growing and changing. So again it has again to do with trusting in the positive or when you doubt what I am saying you are trusting that that is not true. Just take that trust you already have and consciously apply it. So allow any situation to continue into where you can understand that you still contain the belief that you are not already complete for that as a servant. Can I change it to you own it and becoming aware of it is your opportunity to own it. What are some of the relationships like relatively speaking on other civilizations? Well they will vary but again they will always be what they are representative of the exploration of whatever being find themselves attracted together and there is never well also understand when you are saying other civilizations that there are many many that we are not even aware of we are simply speaking for our own. But the idea is that we allow all interactions to simply be one manifestation of synchronous understanding that we will always automatically grow and again already feel complete within that feeling of completeness enables you that unconditional love. The conditions are placed when individuals feel they are not already complete and need external ideas to make them complete but that will never in a sense be satisfying or occur. For the completeness or incompleteness the sense of that is always truly internal. This is in a sense one of the reasons that individuals sometimes become overweight upon your planet. The insistence that they do not already contain it all and must in that sense glean from the environment as much as they can. Does this make sense? That is basically how a lot of the relationships manifest in your civilization. Well again because we already understand our completeness all all those such relationships will reflect whatever the exploration of the individuals involved in it. Again sometimes relationships can last the duration of the life back but it is never planned after the life shall we say over well then it must have been monogamous. In that sense. But it has never intended and it has always understood that if something changes its face congratulations time to get excited what's next. So again understand when you are not feeling able to express love unconditionally you feel incompleteness but when you already feel complete you can simply allow things to be what they are and not need to place conditions upon what you feel they must be in order to satisfy you. Again implying you are not self-satisfying. So it would be wise then to feel complete with oneself. So allow opportunities of this quote unquote feeling need as you have shared to key you in to what the greed of the belief you still hold that you are not complete already which you are. Individuals pondering their incompleteness do it from their completeness. There is a paradox but that is what happens. You can never be incomplete. You can only think you are at that way and get that effect but you are doing it completely. So certain relationships you create help you to see that or go through that and it might if that is your exploration yes but it need not be and you can transform any given one by utilizing it each time you feel that rather than blaming the other individual look at your individual issues. It is also again tying back to the trust in timing for the moment that you feel that for instance needy, panicky whatever you wish to call it is the perfect moment and if individuals begin to realize it it will simplify things for you the perfect moment to transform it. Oh no what another pain in the neck but oh joy because this is happening right now this must be the time that I can handle this major issue just like that. It is trust the timing all of it. Yes it is and I was just curious about how is the how is sex and what is other. I mean how is it different from it. Is it more like the Dallas to the tantric practices that put it this way. Everything that you consider in your physical terms as well as your spiritual and emotional terms to be wonderful, exhilarating, exciting about that is there however it is even more from our perspective not more better simply more of a complete experience for we literally in the moment of the joining see through the eyes of the other. We are as each other it is the ultimate sharing of being next creating literally the same thoughts at the same time and that is what you sometimes call reading minds but the again precise mechanism is creating the same thoughts at the same time vibrating in a sense as one. We are simply more conscious of it rather than perceiving the experience from a personalized point of view. It is quite a community in that sense. Total murdering of the two souls. Total though perhaps you would say temporarily though you can carry the experience of it in that sense recreate that past any time. Also because each individual in our society is what you would label mentally linked and interesting thing occurs. On some level when a climax as you say is reached it is felt by all on some level not to the point that it would distract one from doing what it is but because again we are always in touch and never did connect it there is that effect. Oh yes. So this is what we need by more not better simply a more expanded version. And you are capable of it or I would not be able to explain it to you. So we all have that potential. Yes but the idea being work with what you already have or play with what you already have. Do not feel you need to jump right to that. Do it to the best of your immediate ability what is right available to you and it will expand exponentially. Thank you. And do you? I am not. Why did you clarify what you mean by parallel past and how is the parallel future as opposed to our future and past. Do you understand the idea that there are an infinite number of parallel realities to your own? I understand that. All right. Because you are a timeline is it not? In a sense you can understand them each as the street timelines which are parallel meaning they run infinity onto infinity next to each other but never quote unquote me. One of the things we are discussing is a conduit with which they mean in a sense but because for instance we will keep this very simple. In your life right now in the past of this particular time track you did not physically appear in that path because you did not physically yet exist in that time track. The moment that you quote unquote go back you actually fly back the moment you enter a quote unquote path it must be by definition a different parallel time track. Is this translated? There is a difficulty in a sense in the white. By definition because you never actually appear in your own path. So the moment you create transcending a time into a path it creates a new factor. It is now a timeline with which that happens and it is parallel to your own. You could affect history but were you to go back to your original timeline you would find nothing to be affected. The history that would be affected is the history along the parallel timeline. So this makes sense. Let me try this out. Go ahead to the parallel timeline you are actually creating. You may be spewing off a parallel reality. You are creating an edge you do it. In a sense. So these things that are in a parallel future who are showing up in spacecraft that are from you say they are from a parallel future yes. Yes. They are in a sense creating this reality because this would to them be a parallel reality. From their perspective not from yours. And how do they fit into our reality? Why are they bleeding in at this time? Because it is representative of your allowance of yourself to see other aspects. An idea is within your consciousness. As you unfold and begin to see the multi-dimensional aspect of creation you begin to get multi-dimensional effects literally. Are these human beings like ourselves? So yes. The ones we were speaking of with this individual are literally what you would consider to be humans from your earth in your quote unquote future but again in the parallel future. Are these beings commonly involved in interactions with people in this planet at this time? From very uncommon. There is sometimes a misunderstanding from their perspective that in parallel timelines so therefore they are quite quote unquote careful. I see. They wish to observe and not affect in general. I have written in the literature however that along with the same particular beings people want to report school of one very human being looking at people. In general they are creatians. Sometimes they will be individuals that you label that are interacting from your planet with the reticulum. That is all we can share along those lines for a specific reason but in general no it will not be the parallel future manifestations for they again choose to be non-interferes and simply observational if you wish to map and record in a sense history. The perspective is it common for people to move back and forward in their own timeline and the purpose is it common for people to come from quote our past the future our linear future come back here to assist us at this point through a difficult transition for sight. It occurs perhaps you can say it is not common in that way but it is again more for the observation and the recording more than to affect for there is not again and we see in the population we are speaking of a total understanding of the mechanism. You would want to change history. Yes quite literally there are also manifestations from what you would label the past as well for there were other technological errors in your society. And along where are you presently you in the Southcraft? I am presently aboard what you would label to be the scout craft of Beshar this will be the last interaction then I will be on my own. Beshar, myself and the female to which we are early on. One of my questions. No. I will read to you all and thank you. And to you. You said you are. Yes. Pretty quick. Actually I just popped into my head that over the years I remember saying during the day light hours well I considered to be two moons. One would be exactly even from the other moon and it would be late in the afternoon before darkness usually when or if it is like and even in the morning time when the sun would be up these two moons would be there. Now this does not occur all the time but it has occurred and I remember this vividly that these two moons existed and at least from I am open-minded enough to understand that I know that there is one moon that we presently see in general from our planet. But I have seen two moons and could you explain a little bit about that. In a sense you can say for those moments you are viewing alternate realities simply opening up your eyes and perhaps shifting literally the focus from this particular reality to a slightly altered one. Okay. Slightly altered one. Sing two moons would fit me in two different realities at the same time. In a sense you can say at that moment you are simultaneously perceiving to reality. So by doing that you have the choices a free choice of which reality at the time you want to do what's the other. It depends on the definition in general it will simply be a sampling with the retainment of the reality you have chosen to experience. A lot of times that experience is quite often I realized what it was all about. My other thing is I had recently gone sick and I know a lot of people are getting sick in general what we call a flu. By the way this is simply adjustments to particular changes in energy very generally they are then judged and many of the negative manifestations are from the judgment rather than the adjustment. Why? The whole life better after a week and a half of being as we say sick. But the first 24 hours I felt very cold and I felt a sense of two periods during the night like my body was like hot air twice in the night and I'm not sure what kind of energy that was but it was like during the most heavier part of the beginning of this so-called adjustment it did the whole body just felt like it was jumping like something was being plugged in or something. In the sense you may say that it is but what you are plugging into is more of yourself. So yes that is a problem. Okay. I just want to ask. Again if you will understand when these adjustments if you wish to call them that occur that you need not judge them you will have a different effect. They will seem to be quite minimal and be on their way but because of the very strong labels that you have about the particular expectation that an illness must run a particular course you assign the meaning you get the effect. Now this does not mean if you are experiencing it negatively that you need to be rate yourself no that will compound the seeming result but you can understand that when you feel anything quote unquote out of the ordinary that it is simply an adjustment in adaptation a literal transmutative adaptation to the changing environment the changing energy and the changing consciousness and simply say oh there goes another one of those bodily adjustments to the transformation again you will then have a different perspective and get a different effect. These can be greatly minimized and eventually need not be experienced at all as something unpleasant something simply something a little different but because there are great changes occurring very often there will be great adaptation along with it. Again though because of the strong sense of belief and particular catch phrases that you have within your society you create and fulfill a particular expectation. One of the ideas is oh everybody around me is sick. Oh it must be one of those times what you will find quite literally is it is always one of those times someone is always adapting but when you are adapting you then attract evidence of other individuals adapting at the same time you need not label this as something going around and then get that effect but if you do label it as that you can see why you get that effect. You are perpetuating that effect your germ theory. Thank you. Along the name of your spaceship if it has not. No. We do not in general name crafts or we do not have a language but the idea is sometimes we refer to what you would consider to be the translation of the vibration of our mother craft as the solar wind but in that sense we do not have names for each craft and not for the scout craft percent. Well thank you for that also in a dream a guy or teacher sent me your number is 23. Very clearly distinctly now I was born on the 23rd of July. Oh how can you. I seem to think but is there any other reason why this particular number should be identified with me. You tell me. The inverse of 32. Oh how would you do that. What that means to you. 32 according to the driver the data sometimes contact their ship by calling base 32 early fast when it translates. That is in a sense in interpretation and not liberal. I can understand 32 is a number of transformation in Fahrenheit for instance at the point where water turns from one form to another. Oh it is a number of transformation. So what is 23. It is a reverse transformation. We will allow you to explore this for one of the things we are just something is taking back responsibility for your own exploration. Okay. Might I have a couple other quick questions. Oh. According to reports I read Admiral Byrd was the first terrestrial to contact extraterrestrials. Incorrect. Incorrect. There have been many communications and many forms for what you would label to be thousands of your units. That is simply one idea. Okay. Also it said that on one of the slides in 26.99 I am not sure which one. He went in some sense beyond the pole into a warmer land. Did you in fact fly into an alternate universe? In a sense temporarily through what you would label to be a gateway of particular very powerful vortex. It was very temporary very sweet simply unclink. It was. And what was the significance of that experience for him and Fort mankind through him? It was a personal significance to that individual about the nature of reality and the nature of the physical ideas of poles upon your planet. It was significant to all others in whatever way they choose to glean from it. But also again including the idea that these vortexes can be used as gateways and they need not be physical gateways. They can also be consciousness gateways simply centering yourself within one closing your eye of painting what you label to be a meditative state can allow you to access many ideas for the conducive atmosphere or doorway that is present. Oh okay. Then regarding Aiko, Daryl's theme of counterpart. She is a native of Japan. Why should she be a Japanese as opposed to Korean or a person from France? But that is one of the points. Of your civilization that we choose to communicate with and through and that was where in sense she had placed herself. All right. No. There are certain focuses of communication from us to you. One triad of focus would be your New Zealand area, your Japan area and your California areas. That is one triangulation. There is now other triangulations that we will discuss more specifically in upcoming interactions one third of which would be this area. Great. So then perhaps when my friend had the, you named a Maui as the heart chakra of a planet. In a sense. If we were to go looking for other symbolic representations, geographic representations of the other chakras, where would they be on the fly tonight? We will also allow you in that sense to explore that. They are multidimensional and there is not one particular label for each. You would also consider to be your Philippine islands as a quote unquote heart chakra as well. So it is not that cut and dry. Okay. So the most most chakras. It is a multiple. Interesting. Well, thank you. Thank you very much. And to you. Sure. Nice. We may. Come on. When you first came into our being with your thank you, thank you. That night when we learned about thank you, thank you. In a sense that was shall we say, Alana's first introduction in full. Again, Alana has been present in day one. Okay. Does that mean that you express gratitude for you came from to all that is? Who do you say thank you, thank you too? Automatically, do we do this? And it is again, you might say to all that is through ourselves. When we understand ourselves to be an expression of all that is. There is not the separation of us and all that is. It is one thing. Do it all the time? Automatically on some level like you might say yes, but it is an automatic full appreciation. It is not so formalized. The more you do it, the more synchronicity the slower you're down. Well this is already an automatic flow and momentum in our society. It's here. That is why it is called the ecstatic explosion of coincidence. It's there in our society, we think what in religions and in other areas. But theore is what you think is great. It's great. Do you have grace? Do we have grace? There is that just a form of energy coming from our higher self or from all that in. To us and if it is now, when does it happen? Our perspective is that you are expressions of grace itself. Some of the notions upon your planet lean toward a particular idea that man is inherently negative. What you would label original sin. Our perspective is exactly opposite because we understand everything to be an extension of all that is that automatically assumes original grace. So that is simply an expression of the magnificence, if you will, of all that is. That is present in each and every idea, each and every event, each and every individual and can always be gleaned if you will open the eyes to have your vision be sensitive to the grace rather than the sin. At a point in some lives when people are either depressed or in a negative state, does this energy sometimes appear? Does it sometimes come to us from our higher being or from all that is? Again, it is a constant state. What fluctuates is your willingness to perceive it and allow yourself to experience what is already originally there by definition. So very often individuals when in a state you label despair will enable themselves to see alternatives and in that sense utilize that symbol and label it grace. Okay. Thank you. As will you. Shady. Good man. One is I just got a vision of something that is similar to what I saw the last time I was with you physically when we went to your ship. There was a room with, I just saw beautiful placid water and there were these islands of light, you know, just things coming out just islands and I was wondering if you could tell me what that was. In a sense you would label it to be an environment artificially constructed within a particular chamber upon our craft to allow particular beings who survive in that environment to feel at home. Who lives in there? Like who? Like what? What is the society that we have not discussed exactly? It is not literally water, it is what you would label to be a thickened atmosphere that they are submerged within. That we have most recently began to dialogue with and Bashar actually underwent a type of preparation in which he was submerged in this fluid to acclimate to it to be able to directly make physical contact. Oh, yes. Is there something to do with a ball, a sphere in that room? A game or? What you are referring to in a sense would be yes, again, of sorts, not indigenous to that population. Okay, I would think. Okay, the other thing you mentioned responsibility in taking back our responsibility for being not looking outside for anything but just for something to make you more complete which supposes you are not already entirely complete. Yes, there was something else I was going to say about that but I don't know what it is. Well, that's it. I just want to express that I am just rejoicing being knowing that I can trust myself to have full responsibility and there is nothing coming in from coming down or coming in to help me. It is all emerging from the region and hence the nickname firefly. Okay. Thanks. Thank you. Welcome. I want to say hello. Greetings. I also wanted to share a positive thing. My dad transitioned last week and my sister and our children and our family had an opportunity to acknowledge his passing with celebration rather than sadness. Oh, yeah. Although we did feel some sadness. We understand. That's one thing and I wanted to ask you my relationship with my father's physical relationship was somewhat incomplete but I don't feel that on my end spiritually I was incomplete with him. Is there anything that I should do to help his transition? Is he complete with me? You are already doing the rejoicing, the understanding that his death is not an ending for him at the next week. That he has walked through the door into another room in this very large house of your consciousness. You are already doing it and it is appreciated for what it is. There is nothing incomplete or again when an individual expands in that way. They have a more overview over all overview and can understand that some of the things that individuals sometimes consider to be incomplete are things that are incomplete within themselves but all of the aspects between you and him are complete for the time being. Thank you. One more thing. When we talked, when Bishar and I talked several months ago, I had shared an experience that happened on my last birthday with a visitation and in the last, I don't know, recently I had several things happen and I am wondering if they are a visitation or I literally have something. When you said earlier, knocking at the door, I have a bedroom door that leads to the outside of my house and I have been experiencing, well one night I experienced shaking of the door knob and I came out of my dream reality and wasn't clear whether that was a dream or whether it was a visitation or whether it was somebody trying to break in. Our perception. Is that what you experienced? Was real but again from your dream reality in that case. Another experience that I had just a couple of nights ago was I saw a light coming in and again I started out seeing light coming into my bedroom almost like a flashlight type of light. I was in the dream reality and then the job that was staying with me was growling and there was another experience where I wasn't clear whether that was a dream reality or a physical reality. Again, our perception is that it was a dream reality but again we remind you that that is just as real simply as different reality. So my next question is, is that an entity visiting me? Yes and it would behoove you at your own pace to open the door but again at your own pace not before you feel ready and any fears that come up are your opportunity to allow yourself to process and utilize what that fear represents to transform it if you wish to. Thank you. I have one more quick question. I have been reading a lot of white evil brotherhood literature and something I read and I can't quite evil. White evil. White evil. Are you familiar with that philosophy or that energy? We understand the overall tone of the energy. Does that energy come from or that information come from Venus? In the sense that you mean only in another dimensional realm altogether, not physically within your dimension but understand that all the planets in your solar systems are inhabited simply not in your dimension of existence. So therefore yes and no. Thank you. And you. Sure yes. When I go to sleep I know that I leave my body. So the question is what am I doing when I leave my body? Oh you are very busy. Out and about exploring other aspects of the reality. The ones that are relevant to this reality will be brought back at least as a remnant memory. Again, very often these experiences are non-physical experiences which have no framework within this reality. So you will bring them back as shadows. You will assign particular memories to them which are only shall we say a shadow of the experience a grappling to define within these terms that experience. But again you aren't very busy as are all of you. In a way saying that it's a fourth density reality and it doesn't translate easily into third. There are third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh density experiences that are partaken of by individuals. So therefore it can be any one of those. The more that you diver. It can be again interpretation for that is non-physical. And as well as the extent that it is. So you're saying I'm doing a lot of stuff. Well the idea is you all exist simultaneously on all these levels. When you are experiencing what you consider to be your waking dream reality one of the definitions of it is to seem to only exist in one. When you in that sense visit your other reality your dream reality you expand and allow yourself to connect to these other levels literally. So therefore yes quite busy. What can I do to retain that? The beginning thing would be to trust what you are retaining and in any way shape or form that is physically possible utilize the information, utilize what you have gotten in a positive way in this reality. The more that you bring back ideas to this reality and use them the more ideas that come. The more of a boy that is created as you use each one that is then filled with new ideas. It shows a willingness for you to bridge both realities. But when you wake up say knife memory and then go about your business totally ignoring any of the effects of that you do not allow the bridge to occur. So in whatever way you can use the information in your physical life. Does that make sense? Okay. It is general but it is a start. Come on. One more. Are you good? I have no questions concerning the question of infants mainly and a question of child abuse. Being that I perceive the influence being helpless yet in many other statements from you and other beings the infant made a full and complete choice to be without being. In a sense there is conscious choice which is what we feel you mean when you say full and complete choice. There is also unconscious choice. Still a choice but not necessarily full and complete to your conscious awareness. One of the mechanisms that you heavily buy into and therefore perpetuate is what you label retribution style karma and many if not most or all of the experiences that you are relaying. Now are results of individuals imposing upon themselves particular karma. First of all this in no way excuses the responsibility of the perfect traitor but also understand that it allows the individuals that are exploring being victimized to also achieve what they consider to be a valid. That is not the only way to do so. However when you think it is the only way that is a result. What are the other ways? The other ways is to understand that balance can occur many ways. Need not be retribution. Need not be an eye for an eye. We have used the following example. If you murder an individual the retribution style in self-imposition is to reincarnate and be murdered quite literally quite directly obviously it is a balance. But another thing that you can do is to use what you have done negatively in a positive way later on. Individual kills an individual reincarnate and then is either about to kill an individual and does not talk another individual out of killing another individual that is balanced as well. When you speak of the idea of something in this life that you have done in your past that was negative you can balance it by having that then perpetrated upon you but you can also balance it in the following way. You will always create because it is an issue within you another opportunity for a similar set of circumstances to come around. If a similar set of circumstances comes about and you simply then utilize having done the negative thing as a lesson to now not do it that is direct. That is in a positive way. So it has to do with redefining your idea of balance. Does it translate? Yeah I said it was it for a while. Oh is that all? Well yeah. Oh is it not done something hit you? Over there. Simply a suggestion in the interaction with the idea of bridging which I think is very interesting. I have been doing that myself over the past three to four months. More than that. Right. So I sit there for a while and contemplate and recall the various experiences that I want to go on to the degree that I am able to live in a moment. In Dream State. And then I get up and I make it to do this first thing. Sometimes you have to do this quite crazy. Hold on from somebody first. But they have a way of working out. Coming to life. This dimension. The recreation. Thank you for the event. And I wish to acknowledge a joke that played on me with me very creatively. It was an interesting co-creation. When I first heard about the UFO abductions I thought that was so humorous. And I thought of putting out a bumper sticker saying I am a UFO deputy reject. Oh. I had to dream that long as I was. I have to go to the station. So Alam. So, what I do is... Thirdly you're the one you go and we find themselves something that's DCW and you don't dream because it was a big owl there. He came. And I was out of balance being examined by two individuals. And I was wondering what they were thinking when one of them spoke telepathically. Well, it may be some. And I thought that was very funny. You can look through the jokes about it in my joke. It was sort of an instruction not to really, really guard myself as a UFO about you reject. Perhaps you can understand that being a detaining is simply not your job. You can also understand at least from our streams that you are considered a gift and not a bad thing. And to you as well. Thank you for the continuous co-creation. Oh, and thank you for at least some version of another joke. I'll try to do better. Oh, don't try. With a lot of voice. You know, where does the idea that one's going to move something to come from when one is about to make a change that is obviously in a positive direction? Like start a behavior that once then intending to start or stop a behavior that once then it can be stopped. His very sense comes from the idea that anything can be lost, which it cannot. Things transform, integrate, change their faith, but nothing is ever lost. One of the things that we often share is whatever exists always has existed and always will exist. Existence is full of the things that will exist. As well as non-existence is full of the things that will never exist. So you can understand that it is simply a concept that something can be lost. In terms of an individual's experience, let me be specific. It also has to do with what you label comfort zone. Right. Okay. Intering into a behavior, starting a behavior which can open up a whole new dimension of experience, very positive experience. Even so, if there's the sphere that life as I know it would change. Well, somehow I get lost in the process. Well, it will automatically change. One of the reasons we assume that you are considering implementing the difference is to perceive the change. You need not also add to the perception that there will be a loss of the other idea. But very often individuals will conjure up that they have that original idea because it gave something to them that they will now lose. But because it is being replaced and transformed with a new expression of who you are, it will not be lost. Whatever positive aspect of it that was there will simply be present in the new symbol. And that understanding can again allow you to acclimate to the new idea. That we have an inherent fear of change? Some individuals, you change as negative but the power of doctors that changes the only constant. So they are simply not recognizing the natural order of creation. And it does not take much looking around to realize this itself. Change is the only constant. And that means that anything can be changed to that which you desire. So change can be positive or sometimes individuals feel that negative can slip in there. Perhaps that is what you mean. Isn't there two things in the statement that people in two ways are troubled and refrain from doing anything that might ruin it? So people, yeah. It's not a universal thing. Oh no. It is a chosen exploration. There is the notion in this reality with the way you have structured your society that there can be a joy in overcoming obstacles. If that is what you mean, that is very prevalent. But not all individuals share that particular desire to continually place obstacles to overcome. I was referring to some individuals equate that with growth. But there are instances I've noticed where a person is stuck in a static obstacle course. They're just running back and forth in the same obstacle course and actually avoiding it all costs making any decision taking any action to get out of that particular agreement. Oh I thought that is simply a definitional made. An operational question. In traveling to the craft that we travel to the mothercraft and of course then there's the then there's the scout craft. How would I single out or how would I be able to go to the mothercraft or to the scout craft? Is there a different technique for each? Well the idea is that in general you will associate any given scout craft with its pilot. So if you allow yourself to conjure up the feeling of interacting with the pilot, Bashar al-Ahmed, whichever, or whoever you happen to bump into, you will key yourself into that particular vibration. If you wish in that sense to key into the vibration of the mothercraft you can simply utilize the description that we have given in a specific sense. Again it may be helpful to you to utilize the imagery of an equal lateral triangle to visit the scout craft. Where that is the shape of the craft. Thank you. Is that all? Oh that should. Over there. Yvonne can you tell me what if it's possible for me to reincarnate three years before the person I was before had died? Yes. There is not in that sense the necessity to stay within a timeline in reincarnation. Again reincarnation applies going along a timeline. We prefer to call it multiple simultaneous incarnation and there is no boundary. If in that sense you reincarnate into your quote unquote path it can be into the literal path. You will reincarnate as a person that will go through a certain set of motions that will naturally been a part of that history with nothing breached. Did that triangle? Yes. Is that what happened to me? In other words the person that I was before this life did they pass away in 1961 or in 1958? We perceive a high degree of likelihood behind this but are getting nothing definite. Why do you perceive this? Because I read a book by an author and I felt very familiar with the more. Then utilize that at validation rather than our success. Your feeling allows you to know this. So know that that was made? Yes. And you can trust this. Also understand again when we discuss multiple simultaneous incarnations that you also have incarnations in the contemporary time stream as different individuals. Well we sometimes label counterparts. So there is no adherence to the flow of chronological time with your multiple simultaneous incarnate. So that person that I think I was is who I was. Something else about my career. In going forward you said look at what I'd like doing in the moment and do that. What if I come across something that I would really love to do but I won't make enough money to pay my bills? How would I handle that? Our perspective? Do it. Do it. Period. Just do it. It will lead you to the opportunities that will enable the abundance to come to keep supporting your willingness to fulfill who you are, who you chose to be. And also again understand that there are many ways again that your abundance can come. So do not fixate that you will only accept it as money. Look around for other opportunities. Other alternatives. But I have certain financial obligations. Yes. That which means that I need to make a certain level of income to meet those in my next job. So that if I go by that it would eliminate things that I might like. Well do understand that your obligations are agreements and if you truly intend in your heart and hearts to keep your agreement then you can understand and take solstice in the fact that you know you will do so. But part of an agreement can be communicating the need to change the specifics of the agreement. So therefore simply stay open with all these agreements and honor you will find them quite willing to accommodate certain changes and that will be another way of using the wise and your abundance. So that when I'm trying to decide what you need not use these agreements to hold yourself back. Okay so when I'm trying to decide what excites me the definition of my excitements does not necessarily include material things that I might enjoy in my life or or should that like for example if I want to keep my car or something like that. Can you respond? When I think about following my excitement in my career and doing what I love should I should that definition of my excitement include things other than my career like my personal life to things that I like to do like travel. Be clear in your intention if you intend and wish for instance utilizing your own example to keep the car be clear about it allow whatever situations to arise to come up. Act on the opportunities that will allow you to keep it but not in a way that will distract you from your excitement because your excitement when acting upon it will begin to generate a momentum and again will attract the abundance to continue to do it. Because what might excite you in the moment seems to have no quote-unquote financial reward it will lead you to the next thing which may. It is not that that is the be all and all that is simply one aspect of your excitement in that moment. One last question when I'm meditating tonight be like visualizing that I'm going through a tunnel and seeing a bright white light or something. There are no shouldn't allow your imagination to provide a methodology and cater it to whatever you find to be most appropriate that is what your imagination is for. So therefore if what you come up with is a white light in the tunnel go right ahead but there are no shouldn't there is no right and wrong way. If you follow and in that sense utilize as a tool your imagination though it will never fail you. Are there any kind of feeling that that I should be getting that would confirm that I'm doing it right? Yeah. Join a sense of centered neck and peace. Do you have any suggestions on how to do that in meditation to catch that point? Our strongest suggestion would be to utilize deep breath deep long breathing. The breathing in and of itself is an exchange of energy it's an exchange with the environment. It is also in that sense representative of the cyclical nature of your reality breathe deeply oxygenate your blood and brain. Thank you. That will be a place to start then your imagination will provide specifics use them trusted. And Hi I just had a question about language. I have been finding myself not trying. I've been speaking in now I've been writing in now using language in now. It's exciting when I write in my journal sometimes at night I tend to write well today I did this then I change it I cross out all the words that imply a past or the future and I write it in now it's really interesting because it creates an opportunity to focus on and own the responsibility of the feelings I had or whatever as now and to look at. Then perhaps you mean the feelings you have. Thank you. And to and then I can choose consciously from there. What I prefer. Are you writing right now? Yes. So I have a question which is I have a question. It is do you have some suggestion for how to speak in the now in now language as I call it. With other people which doesn't which doesn't create discomfort for me or them. I mean how to make it easier to speak like that and be understood. Simply do it to the extent again that you feel will be comfortable. You have your own lives you know where it will be crossed and where it will not. It is obvious to whatever extent you are able to still make your communication clear you can do so. But because again most of the society is deep in the passing and futureing you may need to somewhat translate or interpret for their understanding. I had this all came up because I met a person and I realized that I'm I'm defining who I am in explaining who I am or meeting a new person by the past and not by the now. Which is where I create myself now. So it was. Oh when you in that sense approach individuals you have known approach them as a new they are different as you recreate yourself in each moment and are literally a different being at the same time as maintaining your individuality. So are they begin to treat and respect and detect and honor and acknowledge the change within them. Exactly thank you and to you other people. Oh hello I love you. I'm Bishar and the third party on your craft. I had a dream recently. I have lots of dreams. I was out of bus with Tommy and Laura and we were going water skiing and we had our water skis with us and all of a sudden this inspector appeared and he wanted to know where our personal floatation devices were and I realized we had forgotten them. Living on the edge. We've forgotten them and this stands to give you a large fine you say. So I thought to myself what can I do and the next thought was you can wake up so I woke up. Oh very good. And it was the greatest feeling I'd have to pay the fine. It was an amazingly that day I was thinking about the dream and I thought to myself I wonder if that's what on Bishar mean by a fact simple. Oh I wonder. Very simple. I know. No it was great. I think it was a good example. It is. For that is how literally you create and perpetuate your own reality. Perhaps you have not gotten it down to the point that if you get your traffic ticket you can simply fall asleep. However. But the idea is that is the literal literal domain that one has over there we go. I also tried using. By the way you did not need the personal device. That was simply a societal idea when your in a sense approach was to simply go for it. Well you did not accept the societal judgment you woke up. I also tried using the black background with the black triangle that lighted that is where the difficulty lost. I did use it. Oh and I I glimpsed beings that I've never gone before in a group. And the whole theme it was very fleeting but it was very different from anything I'd experienced before. That is our address. Our phone number if you will. Therefore when you dial we pick up. Have you ever heard of a group called Abraham? Not necessarily by that designation though we feel we understand the overall energy. Well it's a I was browsing through a book I was thinking of learning to someone and I'm glad I browsed through it before I long. But it's it's it's called Abraham speaks and it's a group of at least they say it's a group of 100 non-physical beings who gather together to teach. And they described an adjustment that's going to take place in the axis of the earth. That is going to cause tremendous flooding in earthquake. That is not our perception. That is a physical shift of the whole. Our perspective is that any shift that would occur will simply be electromagnetics. Not physically. At least on the earth that we aren't communicating to you on right now. Well that's why I was very glad I didn't handle this anybody because it was an incredible doomsday story even to the point where they were telling you to put food and water and clothing in your car so you could always jump in your car and leave your building. Sometimes individuals can appreciate the stories without needing to live the reality. Remember again the library analogy that we sometimes use. You can read all the books but it's the ones you check out that are your life. So there need not be a hesitation in exposing yourself to certain ideas to see where you are oriented compared to them. But in that sense again your awareness of them does not automatically mean you must experience them. Well I was very grateful to have had your information prior to looking at this. Oh I'd like to just thank you for the gift that you're giving us of sharing yourselves with us. It's really wonderful. We understand this to be an equal sharing and thank you for the gift that you give. Oh. Shred it. You want it? Over there. We did an exercise here one night as a group. It was a video I took this on a guided meditation and the idea was we were we were group that came together on this planet for a purpose and we were going back to a home base for a meeting and we were sitting around at a large table and we were asked to close their eyes and and focus our attention and then open up and take a look at ourselves. Look at our hands, look at the people around and the result was very surprising. Different individuals perceived different ideas. They sure did. This is what association is a collection of many societies. It seems like our visualizations have accommodated everyone else's visualizations as well. I mean some people saw the people around the tables as lizard beings. I expected I was thinking in terms of a tall, very aesthetic, maybe blonde or maybe dark hair, but very aesthetic. When I looked at my hands they were very swarthy, very strong and I looked around the table and I was at a table of beings that looked even more fierce than the Klingons. Then when we were asked to stand up we stood up and I noticed that we were all beings of light in like flowing rose and the Klingon type bodies were still seated. What I'm meant to do for is a comment not just on my perception but on the perception of the others in the group. Are we really that diverse group? Do we come from different star systems, different planets? Is there or what is the purpose? Let's say is there, what is the purpose for our coming together at this time on the planet in this location? Again not to confuse the issue but again you are all from everywhere, therefore nowhere in particular. And you can understand that the connections that are close to you will simply have certain relevance to this present life. Yes it is that diverse. There are many reasons for your coming together. There are individual reasons collectively one of the strongest reasons is to act in a sense as a coordinated body of individuals, a micro association in that sense for the facilitation in a sense from the perspective of the ground to begin to allow individuals to be reflected back to them their participation in the creation of their lives. They are young. Is that not enough? That's enough I was kind of hoping a planetary significance. Is that not a planetary significance? Through aiming the existence of the transformation of an entire civilization. I want to ask you about the economic system of the world. Right now we are in a situation where everybody is worried about the economy, the stock market. In terms of the stock market they think the stock market is due today on the planet Earth went up. Therefore the indicators, the Earth indicators say things are going to get better for people with monetary financial investments. My question is in my reality I don't think the future is being necessarily involved in the exchange of money or credit cards or TV sets and VCRs and a lot of other stuff that we currently have now. It is our future, our near future, our very near future, going to be a lot different economically in terms of the way we look at money, the way we look at material value. If I near you mean the next few years, not necessarily but there will be an abrupt shift and there will be reassignment of values and a reassessment of the method of exchange shifts there will be. You need to appear then and again if you simply have the intention now to begin to attract yourself even just the intention to attract yourself open it systems of exchange on whatever level you can physically participate on them you will begin to implement alternate reality so that when a particular overall structure if it should will shake itself apart you will already be involved in alternate systems and therefore literally feel no effect around you you will see an effect but not personally feeling. So our suggestion again would be to have the intention and begin to attract such situations where you can directly exchange with individuals. We have such a system we call bartering which is a system that has been around for a long time but it's not been widely used in terms of governments. There are pockets of it being widely used and you can attract yourself to one as a beginning this is only a rudimentary success away from the system you already have. So eventually whether it takes 10 or 20 or 30 years or whatever amount of time to transform our economical way of looking at life on the planet in terms of money and material values that will eventually happen in itself on on a total scale. Yes it can it is possible for it to be within the next year it is possible. On your on your solicitation and some of the others with the association of worlds did you ever have a past in your earlier inclinations of a civilization where you had similar economics that you had to deal with not really but again understand that our race is a product of hybridization so we already had in that sense a head star if you wish to call it that in another alternate system which is where we need gas. Why is we on the planet earth and this current reality of our particular earth planet and I've decided to go from let's say the oneness of Atlantis or a marine society to a situation now where we at least when I say now currently on this present path in the last 40 to 50 or so years and more have been so materialistic in our approach to dealing with each other. It says we have to do with the perspective of separation as you have said not functioning as a one assuming that you are not self complete and need outer ideas to make you complete that was the set of circumstances that arise from the exploration of more and more separation in which you literally even separate the symbol from the actual service. So now actually and now it's coming back together right so that's what for density transformational stages togetherness, oneness and integration of the whole. More of an equal sharing and an equal assignment of value. Okay thank you very much you want to ask you a little bit more about the those people that travel from the future. Is it possible that some of these people could be related or connected to those people you know the for instance why I would even dream about them would I have some connection with? Who's that? That's something that in a sense most literally as you perceive the craft so did you perceive the ground from the past? Yes but you have played a veil between the two. So I was coming back to see myself and up and is that to trigger something? Most definitely. What would be the potential use of triggering those? Is it two way thing useful for them as well as for me? It is a mutual trigger yet but you will need to provide up with what the trigger has provided to you up to this point. It's significant and what it triggers will change as you change and reflect back to it. But mainly again in a most general sense it is your overall recognition of the other portions of your consciousness as being real. And is that a phenomena that has happened to other people or will we have anymore? Yes there were others in the crowds and others upon the craft in that even particular instance that we're having. Similar experience. Simon, thanks. Yeah I also dreamed last night interestingly that I was somewhere where there was these big video screens and all this electronic stuff and there were all these Japanese people around me. And we were all waiting to watch Bashar on this video. Did you never came on? It's very interesting. And when someone came on that was speaking Japanese for a while at one point came on the screen. Why do you think that was not special? I don't know. Oh look at that it was. It was a different version of Bashar. Same version, different channel. Different channel. But a particular expectation that the information would only be accepted in a certain way. Why would I happen to that? Can you tell me? We are speaking about responsibility. Can you tell me what does it mean to you? I think it ties into the connection with the people from the future also. What? That I must have other aspects that are being channeled. What else? Somewhere else. And that I will be doing, so I will be fulfilling that role myself. What else? That's all that comes to mind. Oh that was quite a bit and that was the point. You can always access it. Need not place the responsibility of your answer as a question. You have the answer within you. Allow your imagination to be validated when you are interpreting these things. Thanks. And at this time, allow me, Bashar, to thank you all most, most greatly. Very often, when we are interacting with us, we are interacting with us, thank us for what we have shared. We constantly remind you that we also gain greatly from these interactions. I personally, Bashar have been quite enriched by the experience of interacting with many many individuals upon your planet. I Bashar personally am available directly through not outside, but the center of your being. It is always my pleasure to function in this way. Always have. But as individuals begin to validate what they get, we are getting some public access. Therefore again, if you will be willing to view, the change, the shift in the energy as a new beginning, you can also experience it as a reverse for it literally is. You are losing nothing at gaining everything. I am still available. Simply, you will need to rely upon your own trust, of your own internal senses. That will be the playground that we will meet upon from this point forward, except for rare occasions. I wish now to also again thank the channel for despite the fact that you live in a society where such a style of interaction is considered a bit outrageous by many. And there was a consideration as you say of a reputation. I truly appreciate the open willingness of the channel to continue to convey the ideas we have shared. As well as well. I appreciate in a way that is perhaps greater than you might imagine the participation of each and every one of me. For it had not and could not be the interaction that it is were one of you missing, whether or not you ever asked a question or interacted verbally. There has been direct interactions. There has been a lot of questions between all of us on again the many levels that you create. Sometimes it will be an unconscious level. Also again, I remind you, it is no accident that you have been attracted to a channel that is now channeling a lot as well. There is much to be shared and there is a direct connection along and anyone who finds themselves attracted to these interactions. I also thank in that sense Allah for we have had a good time and will continue at least on our end to use us. We will meet again. Simply we will walk in the dream that you consider to be your nighttime dream reality. We again thank you also for your willingness to begin to think that there even might be more to your reality than me the eye. There has been even more than a 25,000 year tendency upon your planet to not believe this idea and therefore it brings us and me great joy to be able to interact with your society within the timing of the transformation from that very solid crystallized state of limitation and separation and begin now to expand and literally create a new era, a new generation of man upon your earth. A new generation of man that will walk as equal to the other life throughout the multiverse. A new generation of man and woman. That in that sense will be also directly associated with many other civilizations. In the upcoming interactions during the second half of the interactions the ones that occur primarily at this location upon your planet there will be much discussion of the ideas that we have shared at the beginning of this interaction. I, Alain, will in that way be chairman in the sense of these ideas but they will be your ideas. Again allow us to express our undying love and appreciation unconditionally to you all for your willingness to begin to live, live your dream. You are now all literally entering a phase of your reality whereby we name physically me. You may understand that you have arrived in waking dream and we thank you and we bid you a most fond and loving life dream and dream life and good evening.
