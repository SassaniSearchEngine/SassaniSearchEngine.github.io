 All right, I'll say before we continue, allow me to assist and facilitate in the delivery of a communication from another aspect of your Earth's family. One moment. We wish to communicate with you congratulations for your willingness to embody the principles which will allow for the uni-tization of our planet. Understand that it brings us great joy to prospectively interact with you at this time. It is not possible for us to swim in your free so therefore should you wish to initiate communications with what you might label aliens. We are right in your backyard but it will require in that and for a physical interaction the idea of you coming to us. Therefore we invite you to swim in our sea, our sea of as you say ecstasy our sea of joy for when we are closer to you physically than it allows us to stand to feel your vibration and communicate with you what you might call telepathically. Therefore if you wish to function as a member of the association an ambassadore if you will then you have upon your planet upon this planet right now that we share the ability to do so by interacting with us. We recognize that the day is approaching whereby we will be one world. We desire this most greatly. We have in that sense been separated for a long time and now wish to again remember you. Therefore we invite you to swim physically with us but we also invite in that sense contact in a similar fashion through what you call your sleighing dream for this is a meeting ground which is common to us both a sea in which we can both swim. That is also a sea of ecstasy. Therefore focus and in that sense in the next few nights if you are willing we will swim together and begin to act as unified citizens of one world for we are your brothers and sisters of the sea. We thank you. Was the message you see? We thank you there was a degree of adaptation for the channel in that sense to be able to deliver that communication. It seems for some reason that is an area of resistance within him. However allow us again to thank him as well as you all for what has occurred in this sense. This evening of your time is nothing less than a reunion of members of your soul family that you have not interacted with physically in quite some time. Therefore it will always be up to you in that sense whether or not you wish to interact with them, the dolphins, the whales of your planet but should you wish to you will find a degree of willingness on their end that you have not till this time in your history for the time is right. And the gateway, the threshold that will allow the ease of transition for many individuals that you perhaps never thought would change will also be the same conducive doorway through which you will reunify another race of the that you coexist with in much of a similar fashion in much of a similar style of consciousness upon your planet and we thank you. Shredding. Fimeh. Hi. So is that the energy that Andrew was feeling today is located with the connection with the dolphin energy? Perhaps you can say he sensed the resistance. Yes, this is okay. The energy in and of itself is not unpleasant. But when in that sense you do not trust what it is you have created and feel that perhaps one little thing can slip in there. You can in that sense experience that as a resistance. However, it has been a lesson for us. So was that a collective? You were actually in that sense communicating with a particular dolphin, the style of which we have called dreamer dolphin, though not the exact same one that has in that way interacted through what you would label by shop. Or there are more than one that function in this capacity. The particular individual that communicated with you this evening of your time is now rounding about what you would call your Hawaiian island. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. That was really great. And I enjoyed it so much. So did they. And in that sense it is their desire to communicate with you, though it need not be in this particular format. is one option, but you may understand that their invitation was a very personal one to each and every one of you. And speaking of the dream reality, how we can deal with them, that seems my realization that I am actually swimming in some sort of fluid in my dreams. Is that true? Well, to some degree, yes. Your atmosphere that you perceive to be empty space is actually filled with electromagnetic fluid, but the orientation of the weight and mass of your body makes it seem in that sense to not be very buoyant. In that way, when you experience this in your dream reality very often, you will perceive the thickening of the atmosphere itself, which creates a seeming buoyancy. But that is in general an intermediate step toward, shall we say, free flight. Well, I'd just like to thank Dreamer and to ask for assistance through maybe means of ultrasound in my adventures. Oh, I think that's what I... In a sense, you may understand that their form of communication, what you would call their verbal, so to speak, communication, is in that sense ultrasound. For though you perceive some of the, shall we say, sounds that they make with your ears, there is a degree that exists above and below what you would label to be your range of hearing. So therefore, ultrasound. But it is the emotion. It is the physical proximity and the feeling and the playfulness that you will in that sense utilize to synchronize with them. And shall we say, again, most generally the communications will enable you to begin to validate what you will label your telepathy. Great. Why is this went out behind you? Behind you? Oh, that will make at least one individual happy. I'm happy. I can't forget all you said. Oh, does not matter to the channel now. Let's just be light. There is light here. So I want to... I've got to make sure I get this one question in. It's about my friend Lydia, who has interacted with you. She's getting ready to go to South Dakota on Monday. And she would like to know anything that can you share, and more specifically, what this person, the emails word has to do with her. Now, that is why she is meeting this individual to find that out. So we will not unwrap that present. But simply say there will be some particular symbolic representation that will come to her awareness. And again, many connections will in that sense be opened up within her. One of the, shall we say, symbols that stand out most strongly? All right, is the shaking of her rattle. I'll tell her that. I'm sure she would, you know, ask for your assistance along the way. That is automatic. Simply if she is willing to utilize it, it is automatic for all of you. And I ask her presence here at some of these meetings, she just doesn't seem to get it. I mean, get here, physically. I mean, she's doing me an enormous favor tonight by not coming. What does that mean? She just doesn't need to be here. The bottom line is she in that sense creates what in that sense will enable her to live her own reality. And you in that sense have a different set in that sense of ideas that you wish to explore. When she is here is exactly when it will be of greatest assistance to her, though she has access of the interaction through other meetings. Right. Okay. She's not always in that sense that essential that an individual be physically present. And what will tell you this is your own sense of this understanding. Okay. Therefore, perhaps we can add to her to not judge herself when things take that shape and simply trust the kindness. Okay. One more question. If I built a pyramid and it was in the attraction of UFOs to that, I'm interested in healing energy. I'm interested in healing the planet energy. Will it attract UFOs? Not in the way that you mean directly. And would be far more able to focus energy in a way to create a conducive atmosphere for you to, as you say, meditate and perhaps experiment with what you call astral travel. Okay. We thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Nice. Michael. Yes. Thank you. Let's go on. I'm quiet. Me. I have experienced recently what I would describe as sort of windows of my consciousness. Oh, before we go on, are you recognizing your inherent abundance? Yes. Oh, what? Do you proceed? Just checking it? It is windows I am. That's, and in this moment, I am. These windows are sort of like things becoming very apparent to me that I am creating my reality and that I can create it to my preferred. Thanks. And this is exhilarating to me in these moments of these windows opening. And they enable you as windows to see many things where perhaps the distinction and assistance will lie for you is after having viewed these windows to create some doorways. For only can you look through a window, you can walk through the door. I have experienced, say, my left ear is sort of, I think is being rewired. It's shut down for rewiring for the last month or so. Oh, what? And perhaps this would be one avenue for me to explore through a doorway. Well, it always gives you the ability and shall we say opportunity to listen with it by removing perhaps what you perceive to be your ability to listen without. You need not do it that way, but you're getting down to the business of listening to what is in that sense inaudible. Will perhaps allow you to rehabilitate, so to speak, that's it. I had a dream last night of a whale again, and this window came out of the water. There was such an interaction with it, and I felt so much love coming. And again, we refer you to the fact that you are beginning to be, to act as your higher consciousness. And that is a symbol of this. I believe the whale said a word. I believe you said freedom to me. For that is your freedom. Your willingness to not need to connect to a higher self as though you are separated, but simply be willing to express the word. And express the higher self that you already are is liberating. And lastly, I have an interesting learning to report in the sense of interacting with what we call insects here. Oh. And this is the form of wasps, of which I frequently work around and work I do. And I noticed that my intent was to make friends or piece with these wasps, but my actions were of defensiveness and wanting to squat them away. All were. Where it occurred to me that if I changed my actions, perhaps to my beliefs, or my actions would reflect a different belief. If I really believed they were my friends, that they didn't need to be hostile, that I wouldn't do this. It did definitely change the way they interacted with me. I would not. And will continue to do so to the degree that you are not setting up a protection. Yes. Now I did have one. Sing me when I wasn't even thinking about it. Sing me on the R. Oh. And now you get to explore unconditional. Yes. Are you only willing to be friends if? Or are you simply only willing to be friends? Very. I think. So is my arm beginning to swell up and I feel this well-developing and the pain is shooting through my arm. How exciting. It occurred to me that I did not have to have a defensive reaction that I could accept the fact that the wasps wasn't telling me that his home had been disturbed by me inadvertently. But, and that was all that I need to know about this from this information being delivered to my arm. And within a few minutes it just went away. Well, thank you. That is how simple it is. That is how direct and complete it works. But only will it when you do it. And the doing of it need not be complicated. Therefore, thank you for expressing synchronicity. Thank you for expressing willingness to assign positive meaning. And thank you in that sense for being unconditional. And using your creation. Thereby realizing again your abundance. For you have an abundance of unconditional. We are going to be doing a cable broadcast on August 26th which you will be presenting ideas to the people in Fairfield County in a larger way. We will attend if that is to be you. Well, we would be glad for you, says that. Well, thank you for accepting it. If the parameters are set up we will not disappoint you. Thereby's title you would like to provide now that we can have it on the headings of the show. One moment. Not yet. I assume that's not the title. Well, when it's up to you it was not intended to be. Well, thank you very much. Oh, and you, Esma. It is always our joy to interact with you. Shut it. Good evening. Jorna. Great. After our contact I'm going to simulate you had told me that I was experiencing some residual sex. Hey. Have you been enjoying yourself? Yes. Oh, immensely. It was as though I was just glowing and radiating. Unconditional love and I went into work the next day and people I don't know from I've never seen before were happy and looking at me and smiling and saying good morning or whatever. For when you change, all else will reflect that change. Others will seem to change. But you are simply acting according to a new vibration and thereby allowing them to match that vibration. It is that simple to change your whole world simply continue on with what you are doing. Well, you're the person that there were people who wouldn't even make eye contact with me. Hey, but we discussed this as much. That's right. That's right. And you stood that and that's fine. That's fine. Now, there is something we did not share with you purposefully at that time. Would you like to hear it? Yes. You created it. Therefore, you can never lose it. Thank you. Thank you. I did have that realization and now perhaps we have planted a seed, but the seed was made of youth. So was the water of the fertilizer and the lightning up. Okay. Also, I did play the interaction from my friends. And I just wanted to share with you all so that she got the message and she got it in a big way. She got it in more ways than she even realized. There will be additional information that will follow from within. I noticed over the last couple months that I've been occasionally maybe two or four times. I'm kind of sick to my stomach for no apparent reason. One of those times was last night and I kind of just went with it because I figured if I was creating it, it must be for a reason. And I'm a little bit hesitant with that reason. And then I was wondering if you could provide me to some degree. It is a matter of what you would call physical adaptation to the changes that are occurring. What you perceive as the discomfort is the judgment of those adaptations, not the actual adaptations themselves. But there are many physical, shall we say, shifts in the electromagnetic field of your planet, in the electromagnetic field of your mass consciousness. And again, simply you need not judge them and experience them. When you allow them to flow through you, they are, shall we say, hardly noticeable. And shall we say, stop them up at a point. They can, well, the analogy is not be digested as well. Okay. Understand you have your balance, you have not lost your balance. And you are more than evil and willing to digest the things that you are exploring in your life. You said there are three you and Veshar and there is a third individual. Is that the individual I identified as the Shukara? No. Although you can contact her directly. This is an individual that we have not really discussed too much before. Where is the Shukara living? Would be upon our planet of exercise. Thank you. As for you. Amen. Hi, Mom. Great thing. Good morning. Good afternoon. Oh, what? That seems to cover it all. Good night. Oh, right, next show. I'm just glad. We're getting a hang of your language. I'm glad you were here. I thought you were here. In actuality, I still speak very little of your actual language. Do proceed. I was listening to Mark next week talk about the silence to me. I interpreted it as silence. Oh. Which has been a topic of my mouth. And I seem to be, I am feeling the context of silence as very valuable. Oh, it can be. In that sense it is a pause. It allows you to change direction. But it is by no means a place of no activity or no sound. But within the silence is contained all sounds. Is that all? No. Mark, are you being silent? Yes. And I have, I was in doing some toning and sounding. A lot of it doesn't, isn't heard with the ear like you're saying, Oh, truth, or, oh, truth on it is a dolphin. I make sounds but they're not with my vocal chords. Oh, have you seen a doctor about this? Ha ha ha ha. You're on the ball? Oh, thanks. And I read a book called, over sold seven or something. And they use these sounds that were beyond words. Oh, we have to stuff them. Yeah. And do you use these sounds for any? Well, again, understand that we are telepathic and do not speak. So sounds upon our planet in general will be perhaps what you would label music, would be perhaps what you would label to some degree vocally singing and sounds of nature. Yeah, the beyond sounds, beyond words sounds. Well, in a sense that would be represented by our ability in that sense to create similar thoughts at the same time, telepathy. Okay. For in that sense words are not necessary. It is direct soul to soul knowing. Words in a sense are a removal, are a description of a reality. Knowing this is simply the reality itself. Oh, thank you. This design that I made in the first half, can you get a picture of it? No. I made a picture of a circle and you were talking about this planet going through a gateway or this day and tomorrow representing us. I'm kind of a gateway. And there's a pointy kind of take off path. I don't know. Can you add to that? Right. Simply that in a sense you may picture if you wish the gateway that your planet is passing through as a triangle. With one, shall we say, side representing negative polarity, one representing positive polarity, and the third representing the integration of the two, which is what you are now exploring. For now that will be. Thank you. May I? This briefly was interesting to hear this dreamer and that led me to think of two questions related to mermaids and mermen. Are mermaid and mermen basically humans who at preference they made to explore being in the water without feet and just being able to swim when they're sitting? In one sense you may say that, in another sense you may say representative of humans never leaving the water to begin with, but they do not exist physically within your dimension of reality. They do exist physically in other dimensions of reality and certainly exist within what you would call the archetypal substream of your mass consciousness. Okay. Could they communicate as this dreamer did through the... No, for it is not the definition so to speak of my job, but it is possible for other individuals. Right. And there are such existing individuals upon your planet right now who already channeled so to speak this energy. Okay. So on our particular realm of existence at this point mermaids and mermen would be in parallel earth realities so to speak. And perhaps you can say one of the only opportunities that you might have, though we do not in this sense recommend it to perceive them would be in the area you call your Bermuda triangle for that gateway is an interdimensional overlapping gateway of many dimensions. I'll be going to Florida in September for about 12 days. Why be going through the triangle itself? It is our perception that you will not, but you will in that sense create a strong degree of opportunity to interact physically with the dolphins. I plan to do that when I'm down there. I'm looking forward to it. And I thank you very much. And to you. Pime. Hey. I like to talk about two things. One are inherent abundance, which is something I've used to a few minutes ago. And the other thing I wanted to talk to you about is my own fluctuation between separation and integration or negativity and positivity. Oh. How do we go about recognizing our own inherent abundance? Well, as we have shared and perhaps you were even present in that evening by simply again broadening your definition of what abundance means of what actually allows you to exercise your ability to create in the moment and draw what is necessary in order to create the way you wish to in the moment. When you rigidly assign that it can only come by the one particular societal symbol that you have, you do not allow all the other way. And the inherent abundance in the situation may not be in the form of money. So therefore, first of all, our suggestion is to broaden those particular perspectives in how you will allow it to come about for ultimately what does it matter, how it was delivered to you if you get what you want when you want. And it is within integrity. So therefore, that is suggestion number one. Suggestion number two also is that abundance is representative of your willingness to exchange within your environment within your reality and does not represent something that you hold on to or store in a room. So therefore, very often individuals will allow themselves to see this in many ways if they are unwilling to create the flow will sometimes create the symbol of what you label fevery so that they must then create the flow. I want to talk to you about kids. I think the luxury between real negative synchronicity and positive synchronicity. Well, negative synchronicity is the denial of the synchronicity in any given moment. So therefore, very simply, all you need to do is remind yourself this is not an accident. This is meant to be. Can I see how it serves me since I obviously have seen how it does not? If the answer is yes, glean it. If the answer is no, find what is right in front of you and get back to doing what excites you from what's available in the moment when it needs to be obvious it will. And that is the trust we are seeking. Could you maybe give me a suggestion of how to show it circuit? Old shell shock. When a lot of negativity happens in your life. Can you give an example? The idea is that the question is somewhat general and if you wish a specific tool then if you provide a specific example we can simply apply what we are saying in that instance. No, I cannot. It's not a disjoint. Oh, but I don't want to. Oh, but thank you anyway. That is up to you now this conversation though it may be perhaps pausing is not over. All right. Thank you. And to you as well. Over there. Yes, hello. Greetings to you. Earlier this evening you mentioned five races. I'm only aware of four. So I'm going to be thinking of what they are. In a sense it would boil down to what you call white, black, brown, yellow, red. So the brown would be the best. Oh, but you might sometimes call. Mediterate. And I just wanted to know if I could eat the world and to add one more concept to you to our remembering ourselves. Please do. Gratefulness. Gratefulness to all that is to myself and to you and to others. And in a sense your willingness to recognize synchronicity is your willingness to flow the appreciation to the universe for the many splendoriferous ways in which it provides the things that you perceive. And we thank you for that in and of itself is the ultimate form of validating. And perhaps we'll apply even more strongly to the things that you don't prefer for your appreciation and seeing how everything serves you is what in that sense enables you to use it all. And by noting that you do not prefer something but still allowing yourself to glean even though you don't prefer it, how it still serves you is appreciating is showing in action the appreciation for the symbol and not accepting anything as extraneous. What is going to choose to use the word appreciation rather than grateful that way you tie the two women together for the multiple women. For you can truly be grateful also and who you are sitting. Thank you. Yes, you think to be sure also. Receipt and return. Thank you. OK, would you please elaborate more on my international towards the gay women. Simply understand that your Mayan civilization had a very complex set of what you would label understandings of cycles a Particular calendar in that sense that was germane to their society Was quite accurate and in a sense the product of a co-creation between what you might call extraterrestrial sources and terrestrial in that sense Were you to access Records and interpret them Properly you will find reference to tomorrow's very big as being in a sense a Completion of one style of cycle of limitation and the opening up of a new style of Integration that perhaps you might call dream time Okay, I need to do some more research all right have a good time doing it also person on the show is that higher no So we are in a sense in contact Okay, okay That is an individual that we will discuss in a future interaction and will directly communicate And there will be but a few more moments remaining to this interaction We just came back from a trip up to Mayan we're right close to the coast and And there are a whole lot of people right near our campsite that were staring out with binoculars looking at the ocean Through all this negativity stuff this summer and really trying to sort things out and I took this video camera And I put it on close up they thought they were sealed but they were dolphins and porvices And I took it as a wonderful sign I thought to myself. Oh, you could just swim and be free and not worry about the things that I do like they do next time bring a baby It was absolutely beautiful when we get down to Florida this next February I'd like to swim with them Because to that energy Now do understand along what you would label your ocean coastline It is actually possible even in this particular area to swim with them by simply issuing the invitation and then going about your excitement They are in that sense willing and in a sense Deliciously anticipating the ability to interact with you in a closer fashion Then go right ahead Thank you, Shari. Oh, man. Thank you. Oh, and private session we have a couple of you know you had your description Select Indians Do you perceive that the symbol we discussed still remains Not only good to see you in sexually By the way, this is a good song for you are in that sense Releasing rather than withholding how many times have you performed that symbol? We would suggest a total of Oh, okay, thank you as we went Three men hi. Hello. What do you mean you're in contact? She is in that sense also aboard craft what you might call mother craft Whereas I am upon scout craft and for particular reasons of coordination There is direct contact from time to time Some of this to some degree will have to do with you So perhaps when you are willing you will tell me Oh, I will assume that that means you are not now willing You will be Thank you Shari Greetings you already have the roster Seems like I've become quite the location In the area for the holiday in general we travel together that is the point Not if you fixate upon it not if you find that it is necessary to validate what you are experienced Well what you say and what we send One of your saying vows do is protest too quickly But we are having fun and you'll understand what we are saying it is not out of the question But not again if you fixate upon it for it will take shall we say a diffusion of vision not a focus to I wish the phenomena It the other night in Southbury Laura and I were looking up at a very clear starlet night and They'll repeat his flashes in the sky It would appear to be diffuse lightning however, there was not a cloud anywhere in the area But this was the phenomenon you sometimes call eat white Thank you. I want to do explanation. Oh, we thank you. I'm Seeing the time machine from the future in the near future perhaps not for the point was already made Thank you, and we thank you Shuttig Very good question, thank you. We mean your holiday In a sense yeah very soon Now if you would like some physical celestial fireworks Watch your skies on what you label between your August 11th and 12th you will have quite a shower Brought to my attention right here that it's more the Olympics also a opening. Oh Oh, how about biology about you know coming up nation And the five ring I'm doing a drawing at home of a triangle. Oh, you know where Cozy Wow, yeah, I'm doing it and I started out with the adventure of Using the symbol your symbol of the S. Society Blackfield black triangle with a halo. Oh, this is not so much our flag before we have none But simply a meditation colon that in that sense in the visualization of it Tunes you into the vibration of our frequency. So therefore again perhaps you can say a type of phone number Oh, I see because I want to draw this and oh the light I'm stuck in the color of the blue tins. Well, how exciting that's the best Okay, anyway the drawing I've done is totally going another direction It's not going to what we're talking about. Oh, do understand that the blue white light is representative of the imposition of the field of your planet Okay, so it is your precise planetary connection to us that is embodied within the symbol itself Great Okay, I'm having a lot of fun doing it. Oh, thank you. It's right It always if you allow it to be At this timing Allow us to once again We welcome you remember you to the association of words as you walk your talk as you do What you say you wish to do? You will again Begin to expand your sense of perception You can if you wish experiences as you say as discomfort, but if in that sense that occurs simply realizing Realize that you are judging the process. You are assuming something. Let's in there which it cannot Therefore take three deep breaths at any time you perceive this and release Release and allow energy to flow through you You will literally increase your vision. You will literally increase all your senses and begin to notice an enhancement of them And you will literally be walking from the third to the fourth density We welcome you as your children And in that sense Unconditionally love you always We bid you a most fond and loving pleasant dreams Keep your eyes open while they're closed. We will interact in dream time We thank you
