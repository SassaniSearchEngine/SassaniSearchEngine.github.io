 I'll write off a continue. Shitti. I'm sure I have a question. It's kind of a paradox with people that I've noticed. I may be one of them, but at any rate they get to a certain pinnacle in their career and they're highly successful and they're doing everything they've ever dreamed of doing. It's absolute perfection except for one thing. They've either developed chronic disease or they're in chronic pain or there's something terribly drastic and negative going along with what is so totally positive. I don't understand that dichotomy. Oh, right? And all of us, to give you a most appropriate answer to that question, we would in a sense we do interact with that particular individual. For the baby, shall we say things about these scenarios that you are not aware of and therefore we cannot glean them from you. Generally, when one does, shall we say, create or manifest the idea of you called this it does represent some message that they are attempting in a sense to deliver to themselves that they have not heeded in a sense any other way and therefore create the idea of this ease, A, condition, A situation, that in a sense will not allow them to avoid that issue. So again, it is a very individualized idea. If you may provide more specifics, we may make a more specific comment. Otherwise, this generalized idea is all we can provide. I didn't want to get personal but I guess I'm one of the people. I'm just one of them though. If you want to use me as an example, it might be the fact that I have everything I ever could have had in my life except I also have diabetes and diabetic neurofits which is extremely painful. So it's the kind of source of great consternation because it's so conflicted. All right, baby, ask you a question. Although you quote, have a great thing you have a quote wanted. Are you doing what excites you the most to do at any given moment? Absolutely, that's what I mean. It's not that I have a materialistic sense. That's not the issue. The fact that I am doing exactly what I love to do, I'm doing the most exciting thing I can think of to do that I've always wanted to do. In fact, it's abundant. I have so many things that I can't think of one negative. All right. The idea most constructed to you will be as follows. What does this quote condition allow you to do that you would not be able to or have thought to do if you did not have it? And that may be an issue that you may wish to ponder upon as you say. The condition doesn't do anything for me whatsoever. It's a pain in the neck, pain in the entire body. But they are all the idea of certain things, certain results that it does have upon your actions and so forth. That would not, for instance, happen otherwise. May we provide a suggestion. Are you the type of person to get enough physicalized rest? And does this quote condition in a sense force you to rest? No, the condition makes it impossible for me to rest because of the pain on it. So I have to take a sleeping pill to be able to go to sleep because otherwise I would never sleep because the pain would be in too intense. Can you describe the idea of the pain? Yes, the pain is diabetic neuropathy. It's the nerves in the legs and feet. And it's spasms in my feet, involuntarily jump or specked in the spasms. Or my legs do sometimes and it happens late at night exactly when I leave the rest and when I have to go back. And it keeps me awake. Or I could even get to sleep and then it would wake me up. Sometimes another sensation is intense, burning heat and sometimes I have to go stand in a cold bathtub. It's just a totally cool out the legs and feet. And then it's a nip-tide. A nip-tide, I can't say the word, ties into the feet so they get so freezing cold they can't feel the pain at that point. And you have a use of the salt in your own medical profession? Mm-hmm. What else have I provided for you? I've also called the American Diabetes Foundation and I've talked to as many experts as I know and they say that there's absolutely nothing you can do that that's the diabetic neuropathy is just for some people, you know, it's some of the diabetic gatters and others don't get it. And I just have to be one that does. And they have no cure for it. There is no chronic pain center that one can go to to get out of pain. Aniston doesn't work. Motrin doesn't work. None of the usual drugs work and nothing works. All right, not to be as you say, self-serving, for in fact it is not me, but have you? Consulted a chiropractor. Oh yeah, so I've been under chiropractic care for years. Then we have a suggestion for you. They often went, viewing yourself as a collection of parts instead of one whole, homogenous individual you made from time to time manifest what you consider unplanted sensations within these parts. In a sense, a product of the separating or cutting off of may in effect result in a feeling of nerve flow being cut off of any direct symbol. Therefore, one of these suggestions we make from time to time is one moment. Do you meditate? I meditate, yes. Are you able to achieve what you call a meditative state? Yes, I am. All right, then we will briefly go and do this idea with you. Pitching yourself within a bubble, a blue-white bubble of gelatinous material that is representative of the electromagnetic material in your planet. Have this bubble have a skin of a different consistency. So as you are suspended in a meditative state within the idea of this bubble and feel yourself floating within the gelatinous material, allow the idea of your boundaries of your body to dissolve. And in a sense, you expand out not containing the boundaries that you are used to and become the fluid within the bubble. Allow yourself to experience yourself as one whole homogenous substance instead of again a collection of parts. Allow any feeling any is of discomfort to diffuse into the fluid. This will provide an electromagnetic alignment of your being in such a way that if you allow it can result in the pain as you say it's subsiding. We suggest trying this for a period of three nights of your time before falling asleep. And again, it may help in this regard. How do you willing to give it any try as you say to look really? Yes, of course I am willing to try it. One other suggestion to this idea. Put on a favorite piece of your music and allow the vibrations of the music to pierce the electromagnetic fluid. That in and of itself will help to tune and align the resonation, the resonance within the fluid and become one with those tones. Allow them to flow through you. This may be a further assistance being that that symbol is very powerful to you, but realize absolutely as you say this is within your control. You have created it. We know that there is a hesitation to believe that one would create such a thing, but it may just be because it is again an obvious seeming reason and how this is benefiting from you. That it may provide a strong reflection of your ability to create your reality and recreate your reality for it is within you. And all you need to do to change it is to first own it. Realize again. You are one homogenous being, one substance. You are creating that pain. You can recreate in a sense a new body with no pain. Therefore go forth and do that technique and you will find that it will help you if you allow it. All right. Yes, there is one thing that I think is to be helpful to all people, but one way I know of getting the pain is if I can touch another person or if another person touches me, it could be simply holding hands or it could be somebody putting their hand on my shoulder. I think it has to do with electromagnetic field that in some way that by touching me they would disrupt something in my electromagnetic field that is causing the pain or perhaps it is an energy transfer. I am not really sure. In a sense you can create it that way, but what we are discussing with you is the idea of total alignment of that field and the technique we have described will align that field in a way where it will remain aligned if you recreate it as aligned. Could this condition come from old negative postulations? In a sense again they very well be so. Old beliefs which do not serve you any longer. That is why we initially took the approach of what is this allowing you to do. What must in person believe in order to be manifesting this idea? One of the suggestions we might make is a person may or may not. Believe that they do not entirely create their reality. That there is some portion of their reality that is imposed upon them, but it is not other than your willingness to allow it to be seeming that way. So therefore by again the stating this pain after you have been told by your medical profession that it is incurable you will in a sense prove to yourself most strongly that you do create it. Would you not? I try to understand you the same. That is one of the reasons for pain. And you may receive a copy of this interaction. When you do listen back upon it what we are saying will range through. Can we help in some other way or would you like to as you say digest this? On that subject I can think of any other way to help really. But maybe something besides what you suggested you know maybe going to a chiropractor on a more regular basis. Alright but the idea of the meditation within the bubble where you use your imagination to become the electromagnetic fluid is very powerful. That is very simple. It is funny because there is a little synchronicity here because I was just saying to somebody earlier that we all live in separate bubbles are on spaces that we create. And that is one way to view it. But in fourth density in a sense the bubbles do come together and the boundaries between the bubbles do dissolve. Realizing that you are all in a sense one large bubble. That is not a collection of bubbles. There is within these interactions our first again interaction what we were introducing our energy to this group per se. A meditation within a bubble and you may have access through this group to that meditation which may be very well served. I was just going to ask I am just made a tape for me to that happen. Alright. Thank you very much. And when you do as you say, kill yourself please come back and tell other people so that you can be a shining example of creating your own reality. Then by quote-sealing obstacles. That was prophesied by some of the channels Archangel Michael who said that I would be going around the world with a lot of suitcases and whatnot. You know people and sometimes telling people how I overcame my day. How does that allow you to feel does that excite you? I think it's a beautiful idea. Then that is your signal your sign that you are openly capable of such an endeavor. So go forth bubble eyes and to save your pain. It is up to you. It is within your realm. Again, make me a hard to believe in a sense where you are creating that pain. Therefore recreate yourself. And if this particular meditation will be helpful. Thank you very much. Thank you Mr. Thank you. Shari. Sure. I am hoping you can clear something up. Alright. No need to hope. I am hoping. Okay. Now I am doing what excites you more and gives you time. There also, I know for a lot of people it is an exciting result. Now if the obvious means to get to this result. Don't seem exciting. But the result itself is more exciting than you mean. Are not exciting. Is that making any sense? Yes, we understand what you are saying and thank you very much for the opportunity to do any eight response. When you have a clear intention, it is not that you have to plan out the details or the steps to create that clear intention. By following each and everything in any given moment that does exciting, you leave yourself the quickest to that clear intention. The thing you are labeling the things you do not want to do to get to the place that you want to be is one of the longest paths and not the shortest. It is only a definition within your society that it is. The seeming short. But it does not because you are a book in the fog. Take into consideration what is just beyond the fog. You are only seeing what is immediately around you. And by saying that I will like this and I will only accept it coming in this way is not taking the whole overall picture into consideration. The shortest path to anything which you do desire is in any given moment doing what excites you. Even if it seems to have nothing to do with the goal you are intending, it is the shortest path there. And because it excites you, that's what tells you that it is. And then what happens mechanically is it leads you to the next thing which excites you and the next thing which excites you and the next thing which excites you. That's also the thing being the thing that will directly bring you to the intended purpose. But in between a whole bunch of excitement and not as you say a big drag. Does that make sense? Yes, but bringing you down to the simple manner. Maybe I can use a couple examples. Say in the morning, well I really would like my daughter to go to school. On the other hand, I'd really like to stay in bed for another half hour. So, I mean it's just a good example of how the result would be while I want her to get up and be ready and have her walk to the bus stop and all that stuff. Hey, I'd like to sleep for another half hour or whatever. Or another example maybe I would really like to have my house clean but I don't have the money at this given time to pay someone to clean it and I want it clean now. That as you say is the difficulty imposing what I am order that you must have it cleaned now. If you did wake up intending on having your house clean and proceeded an excitement, you would find your house clean. However, you need to ease up a little bit in the timing because timing is what you are exploring. And by saying you want something in a particular order of time, you are often preventing it from coming the quickest way. And we realize this is a bit hard to visualize but many of you have not done what excites you in a row in succession to see that this mechanism does work. You'll only go both so far with it and then you do your obligatory thing and in a sense block that direct line. I can understand that I think having me through time with it in long term is better than you know. Now when we say weighing out what does excite you the most, when weighing does excite me more to stay and bed and have my daughter to miss school or to get up and have my daughter go to school and go back to bed. There are different ways to look at it. We must weigh the whole line of what is available at that moment. It is not just a matter of staying in bed. Your daughter is going to school as one of those choices. All right? Therefore again, it still falls into place. You can do what excites you. And again you can go back to bed. In a sense. All right? Yes. You have another question. No. Thank you very much for your willingness to enjoy these interactions. Sherry. I have another answer. One moment. There. The other answer is such a clock a half hour earlier. Oh, right? Eight. Beshar is speaking of choices. From our various interactions I know that when we die, it's my planet. We can choose to be a spirit guide for a while, let's say, or, and then maybe reincarnate on this planet Earth. Well, I'm anxious to hear because I don't think I know the total answer. What are the other choices our spirit might have when we die here? In a sense you have infinite choices. But you have, again, chosen to focus in a particular way. So the scenario generally will be the idea of remaining spirit guides or reincarnating upon your planet or reincarnating upon another planet with an eight similar density to continue whatever exploration you have for taking up. It is a wide open question because it actually depends upon your purposes from your higher self perspective. But you didn't mention, or maybe you did, reincarnate in a much higher density, for example. In a sense you will generally, from the consciousness that you are now in a sense, again, this becomes sketchy. Go within some type of linear progression in the density. You will generally not skip in a sense a density. For part of what you have chosen to explore is that progression from entirely limited a rock to entirely unlimited multi-dimensionality. And it is going from a gradient. That is the type of exploration you are choosing to partake of at this time. Now, again, technically speaking, if it's served your higher self purposes, you can skip, but that is generally within the framework you are speaking not to case. You indicated earlier an infinite number of densities, and yet somehow I feel that there is a point at which our being can become one with God. And I have asked this, I think, before, and I am not sure I ever, and what density do you become one with God? Is that the wrong way I ask Him? In a sense, not the wrong way, but again, not easy to describe. For there are many levels of experience, and one may, in a sense, merge at any time. Depending upon your, again, willingness to complete your exploration. I wouldn't want to miss any of the densities because they all sound like fun. In a sense, that is what we are saying. That's why the higher self-proteller is a method called to the madness. It could take forever. In a sense, yes. A whole time is infinite. That's why infinity is a long time. Sorry, it's not the ultimate goal. I mean, for me, I don't see that. The ultimate goal. Thank you very much. If it is, you will. If it isn't, you won't. And that is the simplest answer we can give. You are never imposed toward doing something that you do not desire, particularly when you do verify and, as you say, go into higher and higher density. It is not that you are forced to merge with God against your will. You never merge for say, until you desire to explore that type of experience. The emerging, the entire oneness, all at once. And paradoxically, you may even explore that. And at the same time, maintain a sense of yourself. Beshar. Isn't that what we are doing now? In a sense, yes. Beshar. One more. Al yis gras? Yes. Thank you very much. Can't you be merged with all that is in any density? Yes. But our impression of the question from that particular individual was old for this way. He is always rushing through an old density. You are the whole world. I am happy with it now. I am very happy with it now. In a sense, it goes along with what you say in your society. You can fix it upon the destination, or you can enjoy the path. The path. The path. All right. Thank you very much. I wish you, Darren. Yes. The path. So, some entities return to this life with truth with very good memory recall of their previous life or lives. You make your choice. And how is it that they do this? In a sense, they do value what they get. And as we have said, as you validate what you get, it becomes more clear. That is in a sense how this channeling has progressed. As the physiological channel does validate what comes through, then what comes through is more purely according to our intention. Therefore again, if you have the willingness to sit down, relax, close your eyes, and ponder upon what you emotionally, all strongly, most strongly attached to, for instance, a period of timing within your history. And what you get, you validate instead of invalidate, oh that's just my imagination, then you will strengthen the process and in a sense fortify your memory. I understand. In line with that, I've been emotionally attached in meditations recently to what I take to be a crease satian. He's a crime. Well, a satian is a medicine man. He understands. He understands. He understands. In my vision, when I see him dancing, he's on the prayer. I think the area is Montana. He wears the bonnets or the headrest of a buffalo. Oh, life. And how is that a lot on your field? Well, my feeling is a multiplex. A primary aspect is that I feel as if I in my current life am here to bring a message back to him and understanding that he is seeking. Oh, life. It is as if I have been through lives on what the Indians call a vision quest. And now I am in the final process of that quest. And I am giving him back the information that he sent me to obtain. All right. Are you willing to validate these ideas? Sure. Then you do not need it any way, shape or form, our validation. Well, thank you. Thank you very much. And incidentally, though you may in a sense, there is no one, but in a sense, consider this to be the association symbol of greeting. There is no full say need for protection. Thank you very much. Thank you. There will be but a few moments remaining in this interaction. I recently changed words that I changed with some people, whatever feels excited about how much money they have helped me by. All right. But along the line of changes in my life is the current component energy comes to mind. Can you tell me anything about this? Not at this time. I will read a future interaction. However, we will again rewind to you that the energy of the area that your Maui is located in is a very integrated energy. Therefore, it is no wonder to us that you have chosen this name. Thank you very much for your willingness to validate your reality. Do you have another question? I don't think so. All right. One last sharing, as you say, sharing. For sure. Ace. I have the desire to channel. All right. Go right ahead. Thank you. Thank you very much. No, no, please. Would you be able to help me in that area? In a sense, simply again not to be resounded, not to repeat ourselves or in the notes of our stars. Validate what comes through. Simply do not say, oh, that's only me. As you validate what you do receive, you will strengthen and fortify any link, any agreements you have made. When you are in an interaction with a friend of yours. If you do, in a sense, become receptive to that friend. They become more giving toward you. If you invalidate them and cut them off and say what they are saying makes no sense. They withdraw. In a similar mechanism, simply validate. Be bold. Say, in a sense, what's on your or their mind. Come out and say it. But if it's first you are mocking it up, acting it out, that is okay. Very many times, that is the way channeling begins. That is the idea of light or medium trans channeling. Very similar to the first, the very first communication we have through this channel. And much of a wider state. Simply again, validate what comes through. Realize it is important. Are you willing to do so? Are you sensing in any way, shape or form the type of energy you feel you are in contact with? Yes. Be fine. Right. It's been sensing that I've been in contact with all that is. All right. Then go right ahead and allow all that is to speak through you. Do not stifle communication. All right. Yes. Thank you. Thank you very much. At this time, we wish to express our love and appreciation for your willingness to co-create with us these interactions. For your willingness to realize that you are always trusting 100% in any given reality. Be it first or seventh density. Therefore again, if you find yourself lacking trust, then realize you have an infinite trust in that which you do not prefer. Again, for the first time, trust is everything. We live in total trust. Always 100% of this time. As you have been called the masters of limitation, we should recall the masters of trust. And it is that simple. For by being the masters of limitations, you are simply the masters of trust in limitations. Therefore, it shifts your trust. If you are seeing that negative trust yields a negative reality, obviously trust is a powerful force. If we decide what you prefer, add it again. It begins with defining what you prefer. Play this little game with yourself. Taking apart any barriers taking apart these circumstances. What excites you the most? Pigid, then validates what you guessed. Act on it and have that be your clear intention. Then your life can be all you always wish to be. And in a sense, that is one of the reasons we are communicating with you. For you are all, all, all at the threshold of that way of living. Each and every one of you, all you would not be within these interactions. Again, begin by assigning new meanings. It is not the same old thing. If it is, you are creating it as the same old thing. If you choose to view everything as a new life becomes fresh and not stale. Therefore, revel in the fresh excitement that you have. Revel in your imagination. Realize that excitement is your stepping stone to being most who you are. And that is the most you can do for yourself or anybody who comes in contact with anyway. Be yourself. Trust in yourself. Trust in your deserved ability. You must measure your work or deserved ability by a background reality provided by others. The experiment who you are yourself and live that way. That is mechanics. If you do it, then what you put out in excitement is what you will get back. Creating again the effects first. The excitement will bring the causes of that excitement. The causes are the fun parts. But if you are creating the effect to begin with, it is all the fun parts. You are always excited. And then the causes are always coming into your life for that excitement. It is that simple. On that note, we bid you a fond and most loving. Good evening.
