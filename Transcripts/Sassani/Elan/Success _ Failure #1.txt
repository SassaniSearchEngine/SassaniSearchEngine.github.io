 We'll say, well, if all this stuff doesn't agree, then there's something foul. But I really learned on this thing that, you know, when you're looking at a bunch of options and you're getting information which doesn't agree, you have to take back your power and make a decision. And so in a sense, information that doesn't agree gives you the opportunity to make a choice. And it really is quite an empowering thing. I mean, not everybody, they choose to look at it that way. But I definitely did. And I also found another thing is that it's helpful to not have an all or nothing attitude. If this channel says one thing, I don't agree with, I'm going to toss it all out because you can really get a lot of valuable things from a particular source. And then if they say something which doesn't exactly agree with your truth, it's not necessarily that you have to toss it all out. And if you're willing to be that open to pick and choose, you can still get some great things out of the channel. You can't not agree with three quarters of what they're saying, but if that other one quarters something that's really great and really worse, then it was worth it. So I guess they got a lot more open-minded also. Being that one of the people I channeled on a panel with was John the Baptist. And it was a wonderful entity, just wonderful. Well which brings me to the last thing before I start, which I best do. When I was there and did channel, I channeled, didn't get a chance to do a solo session like this for the Americans. I did do one for the Japanese and that's another story I'll tell maybe later because there's an interpreter for that. I so far don't have enough Japanese in me for a land to come out and use it. But I did channel on a panel with three other channels while we were all channeling. And we made a tape of it which is now available. We're distributing that. It's $15 for the set. It's a panel of channels. One of them is John the Baptist, another one is this entity called Philip, who apparently is a conglomerate of a lot of different entities. The other one is a woman who channels 300 different voices or entities and has this very unique style of sort of lapping down on the table. And when she comes up, you never know who it is. So, I mean, one of her main entities was named Kendra. So on the actual seat that I have a seat on your seats of the panel of channels, it's the one with the pyramids on it. And we just refer to her as Kendra at Al because you can't list them all. I don't even know. But I did make about five copies of that session that were actually prerecorded. So if anybody wants that tonight, this actually is available. That's the best quality recording, but I did my best to get everything I remastered so you could hear everybody. And then he asked the question, and Cecil, who isn't here, but usually he has asked the question. Jeff asked a great question. Jeff asked, I won't tell you the answer, but he said, what do all of you entities think of each other? I mean, it's unique for us to have you up there. But how do you all experience each other? And that was interesting. Well, it's awesome. Yeah, they all started doing this. Yeah, I mean, you that, I was saying. Anyway, it wound up being very funny. But they physically went like this. They were putting their arms down. The tape is just a pause. Everybody in the audience is laughing because what they're doing is just checking these cover-out. The door is angels looking straight ahead, not knowing that they're still in the bottom floor. Well, Lance doing whatever he's doing. You have me in a distant image because she's handled by his or her as an eye-can't-see. No, that was actually later. What he said, then, you just hear a long pause, and then you hear Lance say, oh, you mean verbally. And then they each do their... There's a lot of banter, a lot of fun on that panel of battles. It was the most fun-towling of the whole session to me. Yeah, it really was a nice... I don't know how it translates on tape, but you can find out if you're interested. Eventually, I hope to have a video of that because apparently some of it was quite visual, and I'd miss all that. But we're going to keep your eye out for that because we'll be doing that. On the other exciting news, at least for me, is that I'm starting a newsletter. I've passed it around to some of you. It's called Exciting Times. I figured I'd keep it the same here. And it's just going to be something that you can sort of give away free to people. It has a couple of pages of, you know, not watered down some of the basic foundational philosophy that Alain talks about, just to sort of give people an introduction and then ways and means to get in touch with us if they want to start participating in the session. Anybody who might be interested in contributing something to that, whether it's a letter that you want to write in or a question that you want to ask, I was thinking about sort of having, I mean, not really a dear Abby session, but some opportunity to interact with people who come right in and then we can have somebody ask the question at a session and then transcribe it and put it in the neck. I just am very open-minded. If anybody has any ideas how to make it more, you know, more like a... less like a stuffy newsletter and more like a communication than I would appreciate any feedback for that. Next month we'll be here January 30th, albeit the pie-mander January 16th. They're both Saturdays. I keep finding other things I have to share. We're going to change the format for this monthly thing. I have an idea and if everybody yells, no, we won't do it, but I suspect you'll like it. Whereas the sessions usually, as you'll see tonight, for those of you who are new, Alam will come out and say something and he picks the subject and then we all sit and usually we talk about everything else but the subject that he picks. I was trying to having the idea that maybe each month we can pick the subject for the following month. That way everybody will have a chance, well, first of all, to pick a subject that's near and dear to them. Second of all, to prepare some questions on a particular topic because you're going to have a particular topic because rather than these being called invitationals like they've been called, I'd rather change them to intensives. We can start sort of getting down to the business of focusing in on particular topics. That doesn't mean you can't ask your general questions, but perhaps after the intro, again, today I'll just be the regular thing to do your thing and so forth. After the intro, I'm sure he'll ask many, answer many of your questions in the intro if I know him. But also maybe it will help to have people ask questions that will clarify and come up with questions that people would have on the topic. So I ask if everybody's in agreement with that. Anybody smoking? Sorry, I'm smoking in the house. Oh, okay. Maybe you can can that. Yeah. But that we can come up with a topic by the end of the night and that everybody will know and I'm sure he'll, I don't know whether he'll call it and whatever the topic is, but at least it'll be focused and, you know, people can prepare questions and we can follow up and say, semi-on track and then maybe keep the second half of the interaction more to like a general sort of thing. Does that seem agreeable to everybody? No. Okay. So, um... How would the person be sensitive? Well, this is one, our first opportunity to learn to cooperate with each other like fourth density beings. So I'm going to leave that totally open and if that doesn't work, I'll just think of something else, but I don't really have any suggestions and I was kind of counting that somebody would come up with something and... Probably the second half you should have, you know, the second half. The second half you mean? The second half you really have general questions. Right. You're in the intensive. Yeah. But... First part would be intensive. The... When the second part will be intensive if there's questions left and more general if there isn't. Yeah, no, that would be fine. The point is start thinking about some subjects and then maybe it's a break, you know, coagulate. I came up with a little bit of chocolate. See what did I say? Everything's synchronous. Oh, no, no, no. Okay, so that's a break. Yeah, the beginning of the second half is nice. We're going to kind of put some chocolate stuff in there. Yeah, we're ready for tonight. I thought we were going to... Okay, well, good. Then you can put that in her pot and tonight we'll let him finish off. Right. Okay. Um... No smoking. Put it in your pot. So let's see, before I go, I got this trick I learned in Egypt where you can take a ping pong ball and make a glove. Isn't that great? Oh, wow, oh, God. Oh, wow. Pura mid-pala. Oh, man. Thanks, Jim. Cool little toy. Yeah, it's been a little long. Oh, it's been a little long. It's been a little long. It's been a little long. That's right. That's all I can think of. Um, that's probably enough. I would like to thank everybody. I counted the sessions and this is the 90th session. So we got dumbness for quite a few. This will be a third year or so that we've been doing this going into the fourth. So onward. High-hoe silver, as the Egyptians say when they know you're American. Oh, you're American? High-hoe silver. How do you say you get very old to me? I think somebody should teach them not... I'm always going to make it something. Yo. Well, there was one guy at the entrance to the Sphinx and boy, he had Americans down. He goes, you American? Yeah. Um, yeah, we're here for this channeling conference. He goes, oh, 11-11. You know, they just drop these concepts to suck in and then, of course, we took us to his perfume range, tried to sell perfume. Put it on. Sir, ask me. I'll see you all later. I thank you all for coming and have a nice time. Have a nice time. Hello? Anything close to you? Greetings and welcome this evening of your time as you create time to exist. How are you all? I'm very good. Oh, thank you very much and allow me to thank you all for participating in these interactions. We are now in that sense, at least with me in the forefront, perhaps you can say, completing the first year of perhaps you can call it a nine-year arrangement with an option to renew. And much have been accomplished. I thank you all for your willingness to interact with me and with us and with the respective civilizations with which we associate for this period of timing and for your willingness to begin to put into action into action. Many of the ideas that we discuss, for I need not remind you that it is the action that you perform in your life that make the changes, not the mentalizing, though that does lay down the foundation. So do allow us to begin by allowing you all to applaud yourselves, please. Thank you very much, understand there was a great deal of applause from our end as well. We were applauding ourselves, of course. Allow us to entitle this interaction, success and failure. Before we begin, we will once again remind you briefly of a foundational idea that has been, shall we say, key or pivotal in our particular explanations to you of creating your own reality. And this is the idea that we have loosely labeled, I-3DA. Briefly, this refers to clear intention. Intention is once again your willingness to establish in no uncertain terms what it is you intend to do. No hoping, no wishing, no praying. Simply, this is who I am, this is what I intend to do, I do not care how long it takes, nothing will stop me. Your willingness to clarify and be as clear as possible with what this intention is begins the process of crystallization from what you perhaps might call the mental or causal plane into your physical reality. In terms of the D, the 3D component, again, clear deserveability, exercising your ability to understand that you deserve to exist and deserve to create a life of joy and ecstasy. Clear desire, that is the emotional component, the feeling of the thing that it is you wish to do, perhaps you can say, the feeling generated by your clear intention. Intention, this emotional component puts the energy in motion, emotion, energy, motion and begins in that sense to thicken the foundation, thicken the vibration, making it that much more, shall we say, able to be acted upon. And clear definitions, your definitions as we have discussed many times are once again the foundation, your beliefs, your definitions about life, are the foundation that generates the emotion, thoughts and ultimately the clear a part, action. Clear action is once again what you do, how you move, how you implement the ideas and it is the implementation of the ideas themselves that midwife or bring them into your physical reality. For again, you exist on a simultaneous and infinite number of levels. What you are choosing to explore now is physicality, the physical universe, the physical existence. And within that physicality, expressing yourself as or shall I say through perhaps colloquially seeking a body format, it is the actions that you perform. That is the ultimate physical manifestation of your beliefs, emotions and thoughts. So it will always rest in that sense in the action state, your willingness to act according to your clear definitions, desires, deservability and ultimately set up as the foundation by your clear intention. As we had discussed, intention is what sets up vibratorily speaking the template or the model that allows you to bring it in to physical reality. So therefore allow us to define in that sense what you call failure from this perspective. Failure is simply the unwillingness to maintain your clear intention period. Now you may add anything you wish to this definition, but for the purposes of conciseness and clarity, understand that that is all it is. Once you let go of the clear intention, perhaps utilizing circumstance in your life as evidence, which is only all circumstantial anyway. That is the only way you can truly have the effect you call failing to do something. For as we have discussed, if you are willing to maintain the clear intention, no matter what the fate of the reality seems to suggest, then you can never fail. You simply realize that the moment that you are in is not the moment for the playing out of the clear intention, but the only way it can be experienced as a failure is when you let go of the clear intention, what you sometimes call or refer to as give up the clear intention so to speak. As you are willing to maintain the clear intention, you can only in that sense manifest success. And as a simple reminder, timing is one of the ideas that you explore in your physical reality before, during and after. And therefore, since you are creating and flowing through a stream you call time, you use this in a particular way, which you sometimes call unfoldment, rather than knowing it all, you unfold and you experience and you build and you accumulate, then you express and experience, having then accumulated all the knowledge and tools to appreciate that expression most holy. So therefore, when something that you clearly intend to happen is not happening in a given moment, you may simply remember that it is timing. You may think on the surface, well I am ready for this, why isn't it happening? The universe doesn't work, I give up. Or you can simply say, well, let me think about this for a moment. Obviously, I still wish to do this, it is something I desire, so therefore I intend to do it. Obviously, it is not happening now. However, something is happening now, and if I concentrate on the intended thing that is not happening right now, I cannot even see what is happening right now. So by reminding yourself, all right, this is my clear intention. It obviously is not available in this moment, but I have earned this, and I will not in that sense give it up. I will, however, maintain it as a clear intention and put it aside. Once you put it aside, maintaining it fully, intending that that will happen, you then open up your vision to what is available in any way. Now that you are not obscuring it with what is not available, this is maximally utilizing your timing for your greatest advantage, allowing it to simply be as obvious as possible. What is in this given moment, the only moment I ever experienced right now? The clear intention is not available, all right, what is, and the recognition, the willingness to again see what is right in front of you, not what isn't, is by its very definition, regrounding yourself into the moment. You will always find in any given moment, no matter what if you look, there are choices, choices that are unique to that moment. If you again obscure them by things that are not available, you will make it more difficult to see them. If you maintain the intention and push it aside and allow it to be most obvious, sometimes yes, the choices may be between what you consider to be rather mundane things, but it is your assignment that they are mundane that gives you the effect of them being mundane. If you simply understand, perhaps again, to use the example, you have loosely speaking in a given moment for each choices. I can watch TV, read a book, or take a walk. One of those choices in that moment will stand out as being perhaps a little, perhaps a lot more exciting than the other two. Your willingness to choose from what is available with your excitement, with your preference, simply because it's all right to get what you prefer and what excites you, and act upon that particular opportunity, looking at it as an opportunity, but acting on it with integrity, for instance, choosing to take the walk and doing so fully, fully, cognitively, walking down that street, experiencing the grandeur of that unique choice in that moment. Literally, re-aligns you to the clear intention. The thing that is not available that you intend to do, but does not seem available in that moment, is most quickly, even according to your timeline, access in that example by taking the walk. And until you take the walk, it may not be obvious how that has served you. But once you are willing to allow yourself to function from this perspective and take that walk and dive into that walk and keep your eyes open on that walk. Either while you are taking the walk or down the line, it will become completely obvious how that was absolutely instrumental in allowing you to accomplish your clear intention, whether it is subtle or blatant. But this is the idea. When you give up in the given moment, because it is not available, that is the only way you can manifest what you call paleo. Your willingness in any given moment to simply again push it aside and maintain it as the clear intention is success, in our particular understanding and definition. And it is no more and need not be any more complicated than this. If you maintain the clear intention, you will accomplish the idea. If you release and give up the clear intention, then you change what you are aligned to. You change what you are dialing into your reality. And if you go back and forth, well, I have this clear intention, I will keep it a moment comes up where it is not available, you give it up. And then perhaps down the line, say, well, I really did want that intention, I will have it back now. You will still get the intention, but you slow down the process that you say you wish to come most quickly. So giving up the clear intention on a sporadic basis slows down the process. Taking the walk with full awareness and integrity speeds up the process. For what tells you that the walk is related to the clear intention is the excitement itself. For everything that you are excited about is related. Very often in your society, you will say, well, I am excited about so many things. Oh, this is so confusing. Oh, well, what does it mean? But you may understand that all those things are one expression, multifaceted, multi-dimensional fastest, but a one expression of your excitement, which is the vibration that tells you who you chose to be in the most blatant and obvious of terms. That is why you have excitement. When you shall we say interpret your excitement through negative terminology, through what you call doubt, which is truly misplaced trust, you experience it as anxiety. But anxiety and excitement are the same energy, one being interpreted in the positive, aligning fashion, and one being interpreted the anxiety, being interpreted through negative and doubtful, or again, misplaced trust, fashion. Therefore, you have it all right in front of you, literally, in every given moment. And the only thing that makes it appear that you do not is not looking at what that moment holds, and not thinking in the terms of the fact that what is in that moment is unique to that moment. Well, you can say, I took the walk yesterday, that is one way to look at it. But this walk is a completely different walk. And if you take this walk with that attitude and understanding that these choices are unique to this moment, and the results of these choices will be unique to this moment as well, you will then take a completely different walk. And you will find that your life begins to feel fresh rather than same. Our particular perspective is that everything is anew. Everything is experienced, so to speak, as happening for the first time. This allows an eagerness, a fascination, an attitude, an orientation. It is quite contagious, and it is quite simple to adapt, or adapt. It is up to you. Therefore, you can always consider yourself successful by maintaining your clear intention and not allowing the circumstance of your reality to, so to speak, quote unquote, talk you out of it. Failure is the succumbing to the circumstantial evidence rather than as a creator establishing what you intend to do, simply because you deserve to do the things that you intend to do. And as you act upon your excitement with integrity, it will only serve you and only serve others. So why not? What is there to lose? It is up to you. Before we proceed to the interaction, allow me to touch briefly upon this idea as well. You speak about in that sense fear of failure and fear of success. Interesting. Catch 22. Fear of failure in that sense is simply not believing that you do create your own reality. And not understanding the mechanism that we have just shared. That you can never fail as long as you maintain the clear intention, reground yourself to the moment by acting on your excitement with integrity. So therefore, from this perspective, if you have perceived that you have quote unquote, fear of failure, you may now begin to look at it through these new glasses, so to speak. And begin to understand that there is nothing to fear. One of the reasons that your shall we say intention sometimes is not immediately available is because the tools and resources that you need to fully experience it are not yet there. So you will never get what you intend before you are ready. So you need not feel that you are failing by simply allowing yourself more time for research. Fear of success on the other hand. Generally arises from the feeling that you would create a reality that you cannot handle, which from our perspective is a contradiction of terms. For it would be a pointless creation, and there are no pointless or extraneous creations to create something that you could not handle. And the mere fact that you are creating anything in any given moment is your sign, as you sometimes ask for, that you can handle it. The mere fact that it is an option. The mere fact that you can do it. So realigning to this idea that you cannot experience, sometimes you shall we say put this in your slang terminology, an idea before its time. It simply is not possible. When the idea is forthcoming, that is the time. Obviously, otherwise there would be pointless and extraneous creations. And if you think about that, it simply would make no sense. Therefore, you need not fear failing if you maintain your clear intention, and you need not fear success if you understand that you only create according to the timing in which you can handle and in fact express and appreciate most fully. Whatever it is you are creating. On that note, I once again thank you all for your blazing successes that you sometimes call failures, but from our perspective nothing is extraneous, and nothing you can do will result in a lack or stoppage of your growth. You will always grow. This is one of the, shall we say, fascinating aspects of infinite creation and fascinating aspects of individuality. You already, always, contain it all, and yet you will always, simultaneous, I understand the scene contradictory, be expanding and growing forever and ever and ever and ever and ever and so on and so forth. Scooby dooby. Therefore, in appreciation for your willingness to interact with us in this manner and stand up and sometimes pick yourselves up by your own bootstraps, though many of you do not wear such boots, I thank you and ask you now how we may be mutually of service to each other. I'm sitting alone. I'm alone. And on two examples is the same thing. I've looked at experience like as like Tarzan going through the jungle and grabbing vines. It seems like everything is just flowing right along and going in the direction that I choose. And all of a sudden, I'm way out on that field and I must have chosen the wrong vine. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. Now, what I experienced is a process for a necessary process to get back into the flow. Now, is that a process that is staring for? Is it my judgment about having what I perceive to be in the state, the cause of that sense that there has to be a process to that sense. In general, it is the judgment, but understand, using your analogy of swinging vines, there may simply be a shall we say period of time. Whereby you will simply hang out. Perhaps you can say, waiting for the next vine to swing your way. And what will allow you to see that next vine most clearly is the willingness to keep your eyes open for it and keep your eyes open to what is right there in front of you on the vine you are hanging on. Thank you very much. Oh, thank you. And the other example is I have experienced what I've done something is out integrity or that's not consistent with what I feel to be the highest and best use of my own. I have experienced like being surrounded by an energy, a yucky energy. So there are beings around me that did not reflect my highest and best intention. That is your perception of the judgment. That again is judgment. Okay. And so it's always the self-exalted judgment that creates this sense of dissonance or this sense of being out of think of what it's like. But allow me to point an aligning fact out to you and think about this. In order to even have the recognition that you have done something out of integrity. Are you all listening? Oh, thank you. You must be within your integrity to notice it. So once you are outside looking so to speak back at it from the perspective of being within your integrity, you can rejoice that you have snapped back to your integrity or sit and judge yourself for having been out of it. But in seeing I was out of integrity. You are seeing it from the perspective and viewpoint of integrity itself. Does that make sense? Yes. Oh, thank you. Hey. Anything to any kind of community? And to you. I have to be within your integrity to make sense of being able to have a conversation. Oh, I did you enjoy yourself? Oh, thank you. I was talking about my community afterwards and now I'm here to talk about it. In a sense. I want to make sense of that in $30. What is your understanding of your second shock? I want to make sense of your second shock. Ah, that will do. Understand this to be the cup that can never empty. That constantly all right overflows. That is never ending. And plug that in. You have in a sense sometimes colloquially you call it made a breakthrough in understanding that you need not put a cap on your creativity itself. And that the only thing that makes it seem that you are blocked from this ever flowing, ever present, never ending creativity and again the supply to you all is the notion that you can put a lid on that cup that you in a sense can have the aparency of. But the cap is a creation. It's a creation from the cup itself. Therefore your perception that there is such a thing as a block is the only thing that creates the effect of a block. Does that make sense? It doesn't make sense. Do you understand where you still impose a block upon yourself? You're giving me the answer telepathically. Do you see where you are now exploring opening up rather than contracting and closing down? This is a blatant symbol of that. Now allow me to ask you what did it mean to you? What I think is the opening of my next room to continue towards the end and the ground. Is this not what we have just had? I would just try to describe that. It is a powerful symbol to you. And in that sense says it all and shall we say the least amount of words. And you will find yourself to attract many blatant symbols that again allow you to connect with an idea without needing to render it into language, which will then also open you up to other opportunities for communication in what you would call a non-verbal fashion beyond the words themselves. So drink up and be married. And to you. Setting. Hey. Interesting that you came up with this perspective. Oh, thank you. We think so. Why were there in Egypt? We went to the casino. And this is things we watch. Well, first I lost somebody in this machine. And then I watched the chills take on that famous machine and lose money. And I watched how he was talking about how the machine was getting it. Ah! Or that's what you can see that he too is exploring these ideas. Yeah. And then I realized that I was talking the same way. Ah! Hey, little. Yeah. So then he left the machine and I said, well, wait a minute. Let's see how it is to win. Let me show you how it is to win rather than lose. And I thought she used to put money in this machine and just won but. And I kept winning. And then I could do nothing wrong with this machine. I just made it to win. Because I was playing the way. But anyway, when it was all done, I said, that's how it is to win. And I kept the money and gave me all kinds of money. Now, after this session with the machine, I had a lot of questions about it. Small one. First question was, why didn't I win more money? What is the second? So, that's the answer to the first one it was. Oh, thank you. If I had places differently, I would go home. So I played it just the way I was supposed to play. I had a ball with this machine, by the way. May I ask you a question? Yes. What does winning mean to you? Does it mean going home with lots of money or having fun? Oh. You can make one conditional upon the other. That is up to you. Yes. But you know, that was having fun. But afterward I thought about winning. We didn't win a lot of money. Something went down to this. See, the thing was that winning there was fun. I didn't have to win. So, when he talked about something that makes a lot of money. You will often find, by the way, that if you embark upon what you call your games of chance, perhaps we will discuss another time that that is not precise, but for now. You will generally find a more desired, so to speak, result. If you are doing it from the excitement of doing it, not from the excitement of what the money that you win will allow you to do. Or that makes a statement to the universe that that is the only way that you believe you can accomplish the things you wish. And the universe will show you in no uncertain terms that it's not true. Also, understand that whether money comes out or not, your willingness to assign it as a win is always up to you. You get to, shall we say, set the definition of what winning means. You can allow any circumstance to allow you again to feel that you have failed, or simply that the playing is the point. That not the destination, but the walking of the path of being, on the path of being, of the path itself is the point. Proceed. Oh, what I noticed, that's how I was being the first time I played this machine. I was blaming the universe. I was blaming the machine. I was blaming the search and stance on what was happening. And then when I learned the second time, after I played, and I actually won, I was playing to be aware of how it was at the time of that machine. I wasn't the money I would ask you to have to win. Well, you were also having some fun with the channel, who chose not to win money in that sense. Though perhaps not consciously. So, that was a great experience. Oh, thank you. Do you understand the overall concept, however? Yes, always. See, I won both sides. Exactly. That was the biggest win. Realizing that I won both sides. Oh, my. Thank you. Thank you. Hey, male, then, finish. Can I, you talked about the importance of having a clarity of vision? How did it help me give any input on how one develops long-term goals? Do you know what it is that you wish to do? Yes or no? No. All right. Step one, figure out what it is you wish to do. Simple, keep it very basic, very simple. Perhaps sometimes, to shall we say, ascend above the invalidations within your society. You can phrase it in particular ways that will allow you to truly be honest with yourself. You can say, if I had my druthers, you can say, if I had a magic lamp and rubbed it, what would I want? But when you are willing to simply tune in to who you are, what you want, not what anyone else says you should have, should not have, should want, should not want, that is the beginning, the defining stage of your clear intention. So from that perspective, is there something that you truly wish to do? Truly in that sense are excited about that perhaps individuals have attempted to talk you out of, or your society have said that's no way to be responsible? Yeah, I can think of something, but I'm concerned that it might be too general, but I'm so glad. Well, your clear intention can be a general concept. Can you share it? I think the thing that excites me the most is the idea of being touched with a source of knowledge that is basically having all my questions answered, what I want to answer. Well, what is so general about that? That is very specific. Allow us to use that as an example. Establishing that as your clear intention would simply be taking the question mark and straightening it out to an exclamation point. I intend to have my questions answered when I wish them answered. Then look around, can I do that right now? Well, I'll test it out. Ask myself a question. What's the square root of 4,231? Oh, no. All right. Still wish to do that. Still maintain that as a clear intention. What is right in front of me right now? A, B, C, D, this one excites me, act on it with integrity, and check in with the clear intention, and it will become blatantly obvious when that is a possibility for you in your own unfoldment of timing. Does that address what you are saying, or do you wish to be more specific? Other than what you call some bad weather, there is nothing that is necessarily that obvious to us, but understand this idea most fundamentally. If your intention is of love and life, service, unconditional willingness to be spontaneous, and not to be wiped out, then you may understand that by proceeding with that shall we say demeanour. You will be expressing through your actions a type of creation where even if such a thing were to occur and you were standing right in the middle of it, it would not touch you. For what attracts these ideas, most shall we say firmly is a, believing that you do not create your own reality, and things can jump in there and get you, and the fear that this is so. Fear again is another way of saying that something you do not prefer is most likely. Our suggestion would be to not act with the fear as a foundation, for you can explore all the thoughts and all the perspectives you wish. It is the thoughts and perspectives that you act upon, that you act with those thoughts as a foundation that creates. So look at all these ideas within you and allow them to serve you. If you have a fear in this regard, rather than trying to get rid of it and there is nowhere to put it, you are the entire universe, there is no outside, use that fear. Use the fear to trace back to the belief that is the foundational belief causing that emotion. For all emotions are a direct result of a belief system. And by simply asking in any specific given circumstance, what must I believe to feel this right here right now, you will have the belief delivered to you on a silver platter. Once you have the belief and acknowledge it, then you can change it by simply not acting according to that belief, but acting according to the preferred belief. Do you understand this? I do, but it brings up a question which I've had when I heard you say this before. Oh, how are you typing? That is, I could identify a belief that I have, like once the process is described. Oh, right, go right ahead. I'm concerned that I guess that in a conflict, I think what you're saying is that basically if I choose another belief that makes it feel better. Not in denial of the initial belief. In full acknowledgement. Once you've acknowledged a belief and you know you also contain the preferred belief, part of that acknowledgement is understanding that both beliefs are true and real and that you get to choose between them. The only thing that gives the non-preferred belief more weight is not fully acknowledging it. But once you acknowledge it within you and understand, okay, this is idea A. I believe this, this is idea B, completely contradictory, but I also believe this. You can understand that the only thing that will determine your effect from it is your choice and also extrapolating how a person with the unpreferred belief would act, but giving yourself the same benefit of seeing how a belief would act. But giving yourself the same benefit of seeing how a person with the preferred belief would act. Those actions will be blatantly different. And therein lies the key to choosing the preferred belief, acknowledging the old belief and performing the actions consistent with the new belief, understanding that they are both true. Not this one makes me feel better so I will throw that one out now. Full acknowledgement. I'm used to thinking that there's a reality that exists outside of me and that I want to align my mind with that reality. So that alignment is the acknowledgement of the belief, but understand the paradox in what you are saying. You are thinking about an objective reality that empirically exists. You have three individuals standing around this objective reality. In perceiving this objective reality differently is truly one individual right and the other two wrong. Therefore the moment you perceive it, it is subjective and therefore experientially, experientially, there is no such thing as objective reality. The moment you perceive it, it becomes subjective to you. And the same thing happens with what you call history. You have an objective event. Many people witness it. Each interpret it in their own way. Each tell their children's children's children about it. And you have completely different circumstances around what would seem to have been a singular event. And that it was not a singular event by virtue of the fact that it was perceived in a multiplicity of weight. Is this getting too confusing? No, no it's not, but I think I can be more susceptible to the point that I've trouble about it. What if I take something that I would call the link which simply is not real? Well if you are acting according to that belief, it is real for you in no uncertain terms. So what's the difference? And when you change it, the effect you get will be real for you in no uncertain terms. And if five people say this is the objective reality and they ad miserably act that way, and you say no it's not. And you act the positive way and get a positive experience while based around in misery what is the difference? I think you have to have a positive experience. I'm just afraid that I wouldn't get one for example if I believed that... Ah, by the way, look at that. For that is a foundational belief in and of itself, but do proceed. If I chose to believe that I would not be harmed if Cape Cod was wiped out by virtue of the fact that I... Question? Yes. Do you wish Cape Cod to be wiped out? I'm not a discolatized. Would a person who did not... No, no, no. All right, leaving for the possibility that it will happen like that. Would a person who did not wish that and did not believe that keep bringing it up? Would they act that way? I'm not sure I understand. Would a person choosing to believe that life flows according to preference be thinking about something such as the destruction of their very surroundings? No, they wouldn't. Therefore, begin to look at when you do that, that in that moment you are acting mentally perhaps according to the un-preferred belief. Acknowledged, pat yourself on the back, it's all right to feel that way, but remind yourself and real line with the person you prefer to be, and in your imagination project what that person would be thinking. At least add that into the pot and then you will allow yourself to see how to shift or rotate yourself slightly, orienting yourself in a preferred direction. Thank you very much. Do proceed. Is there something else? That said, thank you very much. If this becomes still confusing and seems nebulous, I request from you that as you figure in your sense how to word it, that you do continue the analogy, for I wish that this is clear to all. All right? Thank you very much. And you, one moment, two minutes. Oh, my. Greetings. I guess first I'd like to talk about how we did this. We're sitting on a channel where it is too lion and so tired and I was looking into your mouth, and they got a vision or more of like a sensation of myself, like it would be big. Oh, myself, why don't you hear me? Don't even be practical. You're busy for myself, why don't you hear me? What's the one usual about that? Then we got, we need to be interacting with Kevin Morrison. We're talking about flying around the pyramid, busy place. And then all the time we, all the stuff we got in the world is just coming up, and I'm wondering about it. One moment. Will you repeat the last part of the question for the benefit of the technology? Okay. A lot of things that I am coming into my awareness, where I get really positive over the fact that it's been actually a real, like, last month. And they've been wondering if it's a language, two minutes, and a two-minute process. I am very strongly, but understand that angelic realms in that sense need not be looked at for the purposes that we are discussing now as a separation from yourself. In other words, within the totality of who you are, within the multi-dimensional expression of who you are, the infinite number of presentations that you choose to explore. Angelic is but an aspect of it, and therefore understanding this and looking at the connection, rather than the separation, will be most instrumental in allowing you to make a direct connection to what is sometimes referred to as an angelic realm. But without the separation, this is me that is an angel flying somewhere out there. You will understand that the symbol of you doing the flying allows you to know that you are connecting with another aspect of your own self. I'm not sure I understand it, and I think that I'm quite understanding that I am making a separation. Is it an angelic guy, or is it actually easy, or is it harder to separate it? Well, the bottom line is that it is bold. Part of my over soul is in the angelic sense and life. In a sense, it is similar to what is occurring with the channel, where you would perceive me as the channel's future self along the timeline. Therefore, on the one hand, I am a separate being, speaking back to myself. On the other hand, we are all one expression. It is a direct analogy to what you are experiencing. Does that clarify it? Very much so. Thank you. I have another question, probably on the right hand side. I was thinking about crying, and I was thinking just as a sign, and I just cried, and then my father's love. He experienced emotional and loving, and I was curious, and I was curious. In a sense, but it would only be perceived as tears of joy, though again this does not translate adequately for what you would call our glands no longer function in quite the same way. So it is perhaps an energetic analogy, but it is a very, shall we say, involved type of direct alignment. Generally, we will express it in what you call terms of laughter, but sometimes there will be the expression of what you call, again colloquially without perhaps the tears, the essence of what you are referring to as tears of joy. Do you understand? It could be a lot of explaining, but it is not a tear, but in our perhaps you can say, pass, there was a similar bodily reaction or secretion. Understand also that laughter and crying are both in your society forms of alignment. Laughter is a complete centering of the self utilizing similarities as a reinforcement. What you call crying in general is again a complete centering and alignment utilizing differences. If this is friendly. Is that all? No. One other question. You're on a roll. I'm just going to ask you. How much of the shower is going on? Ah. There is still a strong degree of connection and involvement, and interestingly enough, this has not been shall we say asked yet, but the idea is, though you would perceive me to be on a solo run. This is only partially accurate. What you call Bashar still facilitate in these interactions, still facilitate the link. But as Andrew clarifies his connection through the actions and embodiment of what I am sharing in his life, he will begin to remove shall we say the middleman. And you will see differences in these interactions. There is a few things that I knew of the world. Yeah. I have no idea. Oh, thank you very much. Oh, we thank you. You're welcome. Is that all? Yes. We thank you and love to you unconditionally. You're stunning. You're lovely. Oh, right. Oh, why? You can say it like you mean it. I can't speak. Oh, thank you. Next, shedding. Oh, no. Just testing out that intention just like your reality gun sometime. Continue to it. Oh, why? Hello. And greasy. Again and again. Where I find that this problem. Oh, why? How redundant? Yes. I want to say thank you for our last interaction. Oh, thank yourself. Yeah. It's quite joyous to me as well. For it is no less a joy from my end to behold unfoldment according to preference and conscious commandment. And it takes a degree of courage to, as you say in your society, expose yourself. But again, I remind you that vulnerability need not be interpreted as weakness, but can be expressed as utter openness. And when you are completely open to the universe, completely vulnerable in that sense to the universe, the universe withholds nothing. Do proceed. I really want to say thank you. I want you to receive my thanks. Oh, why? And I also feel that there were others involved. They're usually off. Yes, but... Somehow, tonight I've got myself felt that there were maybe others, maybe other guys, some sort of soy. I'm not sure. Well, not really, but do proceed. All right. I'll just leave it there. It was great. Perhaps you are beginning to get the idea that in these interactions, if you push the right button, you get perhaps your more expected responses, but it does require participation and interaction. That is the part of your coming out individually and collectively, so to speak. Do proceed. Yeah. I just, I felt like there was many, many other people assisting also. That felt really helpful. So thank you once you've done this, very great work. All right. You're welcome. All right. All right. Hormality. There were the others. How? Is that all? How? How? Can I move on to something else? Do you intend to? Yes, I... Then by all means. Thank you. I just want to continue about, in short, my chamber experience with ass lives and ass... I can share with you a few things, but you said that perhaps you could continue this thing and I think you were happy. Do proceed. Well, do you have anything to say first? Well, I just have. Do proceed. Well, when I found out, and I included everybody else, I had the past life, I had just the worst NASA company, I just saw this along with many other things. I didn't know what to make of it, but I did, where we brought my awareness about the SEP-E program. I... And that brought me to another point that stands for search for S-E-F, and I got two different directions. I'm all right. But I'm also very interested in the other. I think that I'm involved somehow in a satellite, you know, with radio receiving. All right, but let's go as you say in order. What have you discovered about the more ancient manifestation? I assume with three books you got. Well, that was the biggest thing that came to me, coming back and forth. I could've been to the chamber this morning, and some rising, I got that again. But what have you found in your reading about? That he was connected to his feet also, that he was connected with the Syrian and the Orion constellation. And what else? He was a king of great... He was a great builder. Hey, you're getting this. Yeah, I knew that sort of. Yeah, he was a great builder of the... I know of his human things. Did you read about a particular chamber that he also, shall we say, had hand in business? Hand in building. And is this beginning to sound familiar? So I was a builder at right now, last time. Of the more contemporary chambers that we are, you had a hand in it, yes. Yeah, but there was a way in the need to have some. Have we not just discussed it? Oh, I'm here. You know what? I will tell you. There is a link with Egypt, yes. You've got some experience there. Okay, we'll keep that. I thought that I was a builder there. Is that not the point that you have thought that? You knew it? Yes. What was the point of me already telling you what you already did? Yes, I know, because it's like all over the hieroglyphics, the staff, you know, the whole house is being made all the way through. But your willingness to state what you already know allows us to go further, not tempting us with a camera. All right. Are you getting it? Yeah. Oh, why? I'm getting it. I'm getting it. Then allow yourself to perform your natural function and build on what you are saying. I was a builder. And still off. Yes, build. And it just goes from there though. Now, may I ask you a question? Yes. Oh, thank you. Why do you feel that you or one would build such a chamber? The more recent chamber is here. Pick one. Okay. Why? Well, I was a priest for a spiritual balance. Oh, balance. Oh, why? Proceed. I would build it to be in touch with the other forces energies in the universe. Oh, why? How about inner energies of your planet? Oh, yeah. How about grounding to the very planet itself? Yes. Setting up an elaborate, shall we say, arrangement of chambers that harness magnifying, balance back and forth certain flows, certain lines of electromagnetic activity, creating and allowing for the restoration of a particular style of balance. And at the same time providing a place or place as that individual can accumulate, so to speak, to shall we say path directly in the lines of these energies. Yes. That's it. Oh, thank you. That's like the movement of these things. What you already knew? I didn't know that. That's what I always dreamt of. And I dreamt of this. May I ask you a simple question? I think so. When will you be willing to validate yourself? I do validate myself. Oh, thank you. I have been learning how to do this greatly in the past two days. Oh, I think. And it's um, very easy. Yes, I will. You have been, and I was not suggesting that you haven't been, but understand that the game that we sometimes play is simply you phrasing outside of yourself knowledge, and shall we say bending the exclamation point into a question mark, the other way around. But you do not need external validation. Your willingness to simply say, this is what I feel. Therefore, this is what is correct for me. Therefore, I will again step into action according to this allows you to proceed from this point forward to continue your shall we say. Yeah. Already built. Now use what you have made in whatever way your imagination provides to you with joy and fun and excitement. I understand that. How can I share that with the rest of the world? Ah, when will you? When will you invite some friends and share what you are finding? Sure. Now, anytime. Well, alright. Is you the invitation? I was just bigger than that, like we're talking late lines, you know, the feeling of the planet. Bigger than what? Bigger than your friend? No. You must, in that sense, or shall we say it would behoove you to start somewhere. When you become a vibration, different from the vibration that you have here to form in, you begin to attract around you individuals of like vibration. That first may perhaps be presented as a small nucleus, but as you are willing to continue upon acting according to that clear intention, more and more individuals are so attracted. You need not be concerned about when you toss the pebble into the pond how far the ripples will go. They will go all the way. So, this must be... So have a party. Have a party. Where your land shows. Oh. It will be the land. Oh, thanks. How enlightening. So, fit under. Like, I must... and this is my... somewhat of my purpose, because if I can share this with others, I know for myself, it's an awakening in myself, therefore, on a planetary level, it's helping us. It's going to help us to achieve more density, let's say, it's going to help us. To be more density, you need not achieve it. It is not that far out of your reach as achieving it sometimes suggests. But that seems to me that's what's going to happen. Oh, a simple suggestion. Since you have been willing to be forthcoming. At whatever rate is comfortable for you, invite individuals to, as you say, share this with you and begin to explore what you would call only, or toning, or whatever you wish to call it, within the chamber with more than one individual. And listen to what occurs. Listen to how the sound moves in a characteristic way. Listen to how the sound rolls around upon itself and creates a third sound, in a fourth sound, what you sometimes refer to as overtones. Then perhaps you can locate individual in different chambers, create these sounds and watch what happens. From chamber to chamber, they are related. Sometimes an echo from one chamber to another can take centuries. Other times, that can be there. Is that enough? That's right. Oh, thank you. For now, we will proceed. But we will share again if it is to be found. All right? Thank you. Oh, thank you. Thank you. Oh, thank you. Over there. Alon? Hey. Greetings. It's a great pleasure to hear your voice in an audible form once again. Oh, all right, Mr. Dinot Mike. Well, we're talking about being fourth dimensional beings. Oh, we were in our little session last time talking about the ascension and the first wave or pyridin or pyridimer. Oh, right. In my readings and following up on it, I've come across a channel who claims to be channeling Sonanda himself, who says that there will be three separate waves of ascension. The first will be a very small wave of ones of two thousand humans. The second wave will be the remainder, the majority of the star children. And the third wave will be the catch-all trying to draw as many of those left who are willing to the final level of this ascension. All right. That is one way to look at it, but it is rather a separated way. But do go see. Well, that was my question. This person claimed when they wrote this material in 1990 that within the next five years and probably within the coming year being 1990, 1991, that the first ascension would be taking place. In a sense, we're you to play with this particular terminology, and we will simply not refuse someone's truth. But our particular perspective on the greatest initiation of, if you wish to call it, a wave of this energy would have began in what you call your 1987 year. But do proceed. They claim that the result of each wave would be that the individual entities or people who did make the ascension will be offered the opportunity to either return to the planet as ascended masters or return to their distant stars or plants. Do you mean by ascension, ascending and bringing the body with them? Yes. That is not our perception of the purpose of this type of transformation. For that in its sense, as a negation of the physical reality that you are choosing, remember to experience, not grow out of, not graduate away from this grade to this better grade, but begin to get comfortable literally in your skin, ascending into your choice to be physical and then proceeding to express that physicality through preference, choice, excitement, ecstasy. That is our particular perspective. This person claims that the individual people with their body would be removed to some of the mother's ships given a training session of an extended period of time and then would return with their body back to the planet. In a sense, perhaps you can say this somewhat localized effect does occur, but not exactly in that way. So you don't see this as happening to say one to two thousand people in a particular moment and at some point in the future. Not in the way that you are describing through that particular terminology now, but again, perhaps what you are perceiving is interpretations of an overall idea of ascendancy into physicality. Generally ascendancy will denote out of or away from physicality. So the overall idea of ascendancy is interpreted in that mode. Our particular understanding is again the coming of age, the coming of, in that sense, the willingness to express to ascend into a more expanded form of physicality by choice. Very often built into the idea of ascension as leaving is again wishing to escape that reality. And in that particular frame of thinking, we are not in agreement. That would be in a sense denying the very purpose of creating this reality. Yes, they were stating that they sincerely hoped that those people that were in the various ways would return to the planet and live as an example of... Now this is what we mean by in some form this does occur, but from our perspective when it occurs, it occurs by choice. Not from the individuals wishing to escape to some place better to learn something better to then come back down here and share that. But individuals who have chosen to be here, perhaps you can say taking an excursion, making a few connections, opening up a few ideas within them, and then returning to get down to the business of what they have already chosen to do. A far different flavor from my perception of how you are presenting this. Well yes, I would tend to accept and that makes a great deal of sense to me. But you do not as a society need saving from individuals who will up with you. And what is meant by upwittment is not that someone else will raise you up. It is meant that you will choose to raise your own vibration and then from our extraterrestrial so to speak perspective, meet up halfway, not be beamed up all the way. The second half of their claims were that those who had made the transformation within themselves would then be moving about on the planet as an example creating miracles and creating a much havoc. And not in a negative sense but in a very positive sense of being outrageous as they described it as some of us tend to be. Do understand, again to some degree, not perhaps a degree that individuals are led to believe, this type of thing does occur. However, it spontaneously occurs through individuals who have no knowledge and no understanding of extraterrestrial sources whatsoever. It is simply an expression of what you sometimes society refer to as the second coming but not through a single individual. The Christ within each and every one of you beginning in that sense to be expressed and that is all there is to it. So you see that is more of a gradual process rather than a particular point where... Well it can be quite sudden but what I am saying is there is no need to touch into an extra terrestrial source. It is within you. It is an allowance. Some individuals will use an extraterrestrial source as a trigger or a key to remind themselves and allow themselves or as a catalyst so to speak to express this. But it is not in any way shape or form necessary and far more individuals will simply express it in a grounded earthly sense. Do you see that transition taking place with pockets of individuals and building a number? It has been again since your 87 years and is shall we say occurring more rapidly, again societally speaking? In my meditations I have been mulling this over considerably and have been getting enormous feedback when I concentrate on the concept of a doorway. The particular poem from the 12th century has been very helpful, very brief poem and I have been meditating on it considerably. And the more I concentrate on the thought of a doorway I am filled with an enormous amount of energy to the point that I have even gotten up and started moving about trying to sense what the source or searching if there was a particular point in space that I was both researching for. Well yes, right here, right now. That is the place and time. You have any more? Well, a simple request. Yes. Really you now, before we as you say pause for a hopefully short break and I mean that facetiously. Will you share the poem? We like poetry too or the essence behind it. And breathe that dawn has something to tell you, do not go back this way. You must ask for what you really want, do not go back this way. The door is round and open, do not go back this way. Oh, thank you. And understand that you may assign whatever labels you wish to those two worlds, but most simple and accessible is simply what you perceive to be your outer reality and your inner reality. All still firmly within who you all choose to be. Allow me now to pause for a short break and we will resume contact when requested.
