 All right, I'll say how are you all this evening of your time as you create time to exist? Thank you very much. We begin this interaction this evening of your time with the following entitlements if you wish. Peace of mind. For recognize that in that you do create your own reality. And we mean this literally not figuratively not sound nice. You do so 100% complete. Therefore recognize by extension the idea that anything anything that you do perceive within what you label your outer reality has shall we say a corresponding part a corresponding portion within you by definition. If you do indeed wish to see what the belief system of any given individual is you need simply but look at his manifested reality for it is a reflection of what one believes within. Therefore nothing by definition is extraneous anything that exists by definition exists nothing slides in there. Nobody slides in there. It's not as though everything fits in creation except you or except you. No, does not really make sense even within the idea of your language. So therefore again it is all there and it all has a play it all has a reason for being created and it is again and for the first time a reflection of something within. Therefore you can recognize if you do perceive the idea you label conflict. If you do perceive the idea you label more than it goes to say by extension that these are issues within yourself that you are exploring. This gives you the opportunity to explore these issues from within for you cannot change anything you do not own and viewing what you label the set of commolta with sort of consent upon your planet as extraneous as not belonging means you are not willing in a sense to own it. So you may if you wish take for granted that it does relate to you in some way or you would not be present in a sense to witness it to explore it. The degrees of exploration vary greatly in what an individual feels they have the need to explore. The idea being that many individuals at this time as you create time are physically within the scenario you label war. You are not therefore your exploration need not necessarily be shall we say as direct and in the sense this is your signal to yourself that you no longer need to explore in quite that direct away. Very good. So not to denigrate any other being to our choosing to explore it for they are being of service to you. They are allowing you to see by being bold enough to without their respective scenarios how you feel about it and this is service. This allows individuals to establish their preference their standpoint. Once you are able to define yourself you own the definition of yourself and again once you own it you can change it. So recognize it is not extraneous. You may look in a sense as your world scenario as a micro cosmic expression for what you as an individual are a micro cosmic expression. Therefore you see scenarios upon your world whereby individuals representing certain viewpoints interact. You then see a particular way that individuals may choose to interact in this case conflict what you label violence. Therefore recognize that that gives you the allowance to see if this is what you desire to manifest if this is how you feel about it and this is service. One of the main ideas that we have found in viewing your society from our standpoint our point of view is there is shall we say a popular notion that in order to have unity there must be conformity. Individuals must think the same act the same. All right that is a expression of reality however it is not the only expression of reality. There is truly a unity if you will but allow yourself to see it in diversity. And the idea of a functioning cooperative diversity is a system whereby individuals may co interact with other individuals who do not think the same way as them who do not act the same way as them and allow that to be all right okay. Their exploration their story therefore when you do begin to allow the idea that the ultimate truth is composed by definition in order to ultimately be the truth of all truth then recognize it is not necessarily a matter of right or wrong simply that they are both choices and you may make any choice you desire. There is in a sense no right or wrong there is the idea of positive integrative negative separated but right and wrong are arbitrary for things within your society that individuals label negative may be that some individual say that is right and vice versa so they are all but standpoint the idea of integration recognizing that everything is all one thing and you are a part of that one thing allows you to see that everything has its place everything has its purpose when you will allow all purposes to be valid you will equalize every choice every possibility giving you equal access to them by denying a point of view and invalidating it you actually give it more way not less if you believe in the idea of peace truly believe it you will be the idea of peace you will reflect the idea in action of peace when individuals do challenge your viewpoint you will simply be of service to them by explaining it to them but in no way shape or fourth insisting that they must adopt it that is what allows individuals to be of most service to one another giving an extra choice to any individual of something that has worked for you but allowing them to refuse or accept that gift no condition don't have to force yourself upon another do not have to inflict harm upon another order yourself the mere act of forcing something upon another individual generally does tie back to the underlying issue that you do not believe it yourself who are you trying to convince them for recognize if there were only one way there would only be one person look around there are many individuals there are many diverse point of view they may co exist it is one of the universal option to simply that the difference once again and for those who are new for the first time between discernment and judgment is discernment simply allows you in viewing a situation to see where you stand you agree with it you do not agree with it judgment is taking the thing you do not refer or do not agree with and invalidating it is not necessary to go to that point is up to you you can validate a reality you do not prefer and allow any individual to play out their scenario that they have chosen you only experience the reality you are the vibration of by becoming the embodiment of peace you will attract other individual to yourself of like mine of like attitude the evidence of your outer reality will seem to change into a peaceful community one by one but we have noticed on your planet a propensity to hate war as a motivation for peace rather than simply loving peace recognize when you hate anything you become the vibration of hate which is simply a polarized expression of love but a separative polarized expression for in a sense preferring peace because you hate war reinforces the idea of war of hate of lack of harmony and therefore you may simply love peace when you are able to demonstrate to individuals a peaceful frame of mind a peaceful approach you will be a far greater service to allow individuals to see that you may actually be that way look he is that way therefore it is possible I can see him living this way be a living example of that which you prefer that is absurd you are your own government you are one and the same you have created a habitual ritual of making the separation the structure in which you have an extent empowered those around you to govern you generally have been from a fearful perspective in a sense you have created your government for many reasons but one of the reasons is to handle your fear they will protect you all right but this does mean that they are functioning from in a sense a fearful perspective therefore many of the things that you consider lack of communication between your government and yourself or simply an expression of that idea a person who acts as though they are their government takes what we have just said and puts it into practice does not mean you need to scream does not mean you need yell carry a bigger six for peace is that you can lovingly suggest as an equal to your government through whatever way shape or form exciting whether it be a simple phone call what you call letter writing but you will notice very clearly within your society in particular when you issue to an individual and also made them shall we say even if they were going to do that very thing there is a revolution there is a tendency to bounce back against that idea so simply when you insist to your government you must do this you are not viewing them as an equal and speaking to them as an equal when individuals do begin to from the framework of inner peace communicate to your government you will see a change when individuals go out into the street and turn over automobile and burn them for peace shall we say what statement is that making what is that really saying that those individuals believe they must do for peace you may recognize you can be the embodiment of peace as you are by definition your outer reality will change it is that literal a creation that literal a relationship with what you believe and what you manifest when again you are willing to be the truest reflection of who you are you are of the most service to any individual that comes in contact with you a gauge of what it is that is truly most you as we have shared with your society many times is within integrity recognizing you are all one thing all one expression multi-faceted of the same one expression what excites you is your arrow what it is that excites you does not do so to analyze you to ease you it does so because it is yours for lack of a better terminology higher self consciousness telling your physical eyes expression this is most me and as we have also said bringing along with it all the abundance you need to continue to do the thing that excites you as well as leading you to the next thing which will excite you when you begin to 100% live in that way when you 80% live that way shall we say again by definition you can only experience an 80% preferential reality still allowing 20% of that which you do not prefer to creep in it is up to you at any time you can do this there seems to be a concern in your society that doing what excites you the most won't support you it will simply that when you have shall we say try it out in the past the level of trust was not maintained beyond doing the exciting thing once the exciting thing is over with you go back to your own trust I shouldn't have done that that was very frivolous oh I enjoyed myself far too much it's back to the no paying no gain philosophy and then in general you will create physical eyes upset occurring from the exciting thing but it is not from the exciting thing it is from your trust turning again toward that which you do not prefer as a reminder you are always trusting 100% in something this is nothing that you have to get any practice at just simply that many of you trust 100% in that which you do not prefer rather than that which you do but it is all a choice you do not have predicament in your life percent you can create them to seem that way we prefer to label that you have choices and you can see what choices you have made by looking around at your outer reality if you prefer what you see you may continue to make those choices if you do that however you are not locked in a prison this is not jail this is not as some of you have some eyes from time to time help it does not need to be you can create it that way we need not tell you that but this can be and is in fact heaven on earth now simply you have the choice to choose which reality you will manifest another idea that is very key within expansion of your consciousness which again some of you may have heard is as your consciousness does expand you become infinitely more aware of everything positive and negative that does not mean that you must create negative there is a vast distinction to be made between the idea of what you can proceed and what you must or will manifest make real real eyes therefore we bring in the library analogy you can go into your library and read any book you wish the happy ones the ecstatic ones the joyful ones the sad ones the ones of conflict the ones of death strikes the scary ones it is however what you check out that is your life what you check out of the library that you will experience therefore it is not in any way shape or form bad to become more aware of your choices and that all they are again the more you become aware of the more choices you have the more positive choices you have you don't only become aware of just the negative therefore you may within this time of expansion seem to perceive more negative but if you are equally astute you will notice you also see more positive in equal amounts when you begin to act according to your excitement only allowing positive manifestations it is not as though you then spend the rest of your life relabeling negative no they actually physically vibrate out of your physical life but in order to initiate this process this is the starting place finding your choices equalizing them by not invalidating that which you do not prefer and choosing that which you do prefer when you do choose that which you do prefer a belief for instance you then simply act as though you already have that belief that is what sets up your vibration the vibration is what you will experience therefore in a sense you have a say take it till you make it in a sense it is not taking it it is simply lying down the framework becoming the vibration to experience the new preferred reality and it is that simple when you do invalidate an idea which you do not prefer you are not listening it's strength you are not listening it's weight you are placing undue attention upon it you are making it's energy greater you are making it's seeming hold upon you greater you are making it's weight greater this does not allow you equal access so therefore it is not that you must in any way shape or form we are not suggesting that you do condone something which you do not prefer but simply when you are facing it do not stoop down to its level do not allow it to have a reflection from you that reinforces its framework allow them to see the alternatives allow them to see what it is you wish to be do not reflect back to them the negativity that will simply support them in believing that they are right to begin with that is not how arguments are settled anyway for there is no need to truly argue your point for they are all in a sense story this may be an age to assisting you in how to not invalidate an individual or a circumstance or an ideology or any idea and it is very simple and it is followed that their story you may when somebody is telling you their story in a very loving way take the pages of their book that fit into your book then they are a service to you you may say to that individual very creative story I love your story if there are pages of your story that fit in my book I shall insert them if there are pages that do not fit into the book that I am I will love your story no less and that is all there is to it simply by viewing if that's why you do not have to fear repercussions of negativity if you are not vibrating as a negative being if your intention clear intention is of positivity is of integration is of love you cannot attract negative circumstance that can exponentially touch you no it is impossible again you only experience the reality you are the vibration of fear however again is saying that you believe that something you do not prefer is most likely so what can you do with this idea you can use your fear when you do begin to integrate and begin to live according to preference you will only be able to do so by already owning where you're already at because of the compartmentalization that you have created in your society of your consciousness sectioning it off subconscious and so forth you do case things which you do wish to explore and bury them hide them these emotions that you label negative are just like any given inherently neutral circumstance emotions in and of themselves are neutral you assign the meaning and the meaning you assign determines the effect you get out therefore when you find yourself theory if you say oh this is very bad that is I promise you what you will it's fitting if you say however one moment everything is neutral therefore I can use this as an opportunity to define myself where I said now so that I can determine whether or not I prefer that and if not change it you take any emotion and allow yourself to believe what must I still be believing to be fearing in this situation if you are honest with yourself the answer will come very fast and furious as you say very many times and maybe that you do not believe you create your own reality okay own it own that you believe that it is okay you can't change it till you own it anyway therefore when you do experience angles allow it to line you up allow it to see where you stand but true anger only laughs 10 to 15 of your seconds beyond which it is judgment it is invalidation therefore all right this situation this emotion has allowed me to see how I feel now if you then go into the judgment what must I still believe to be judging that which I do not prefer ask yourself these questions the degree to which you are willing to be honest with the answer will determine the degree by which you will allow yourself to change it it is that simple therefore again when you are willing to take responsibility for your fear when you are willing to view anything as an opportunity for growth you will in a sense take away the necessity to have a governing body do it for you once you remove from their toolbox the function of handling your fear you will then be able to function having them as more of an organizational body and less of a governing body then more true representation extension of your individual life sounds this is the direction that we perceive your planet going there has been much acceleration upon your planet and this does continue however unlike much of your quote history a distinguishing factor or teacher of this particular generation this particular lifetime is that it is the transformational age this is not simply rhetoric this is why many extra-forrestive society are simply being one of them are very interesting and very interested on what is the cutting of your planet after starting very interested therefore you have had your scenario you label at the lion's perspective within which individual in their exploration of separation of forgetting that they are one with God or all that is began the necessity for domination that scenario did in a sense culminate with a destruction of as a land that has already been played out in a sense your united state is at the same point technologically as the idea of atoll but why we as positively oriented beings are even able to communicate with you at this time is from our sensory or reading of what you label your mass consciousness we have seen that you have decided on that to not experience another destruction therefore what you are seen upon your planet physically are vestiges and it is no coincidence that they are taking place in the area of your planet that they are for this area was one of the initial areas whereby shall we say negative explorative energy infused upon your planet to begin with therefore that area upon your planet in a sense has become a release vow you may notice as you are aware of that quote negativity that the positivity in your life accelerates greatly that is because they have chosen in a sense to be a civil a crucible during which and within which much of the remaining vestigial negativity can play itself out shall we say at a safe distance so allow yourself to glean from the situation you label your power to us next how you feel about it what you would do any emotion that it brings to the surface allow it to serve you this is a very highly conducive atmosphere for personal acceleration and that is only a part of it not an interruption in it you have not failed at creating your reality because the war has broken out upon your planet no it is part of your exploration and you will learn many things from it and although we will not get any more specific than that you may be a bit surprised at what we perceive to be the outcome therefore in any given situation whereby you feel you are losing sight of what it is you desire of your reality the way you prefer it simply go through these simple steps relax first of all relax you are not shall we say in your colloquial language any good to yourself or anybody when you are all upset so simply allow yourself to release take out you say HUD press or any way shape or form that allows you to release laugh cry scream does not matter relax really reflect what is this that is in front of me can I label it as neutral can I glean positive reasons why it is there what are my definition allow yourself again to be honest with yourself about what you already believe relax really reflect remember remember your intentions what are your intentions allow the remember stage or step to put you back on track then respond go out and begin again to do what it's time to that again your site back to where they were allow yourself to be centered and respond in a positive way this will allow you to then realize your mentality make it real the response will create the real reality and then simply rejoice for when you do in a sense use your creative and a conscious way according to this framework that is much to rejoice about you can always then continue to do it is up to you therefore we feel as though we have about many ideas and there are many questions in our well than a appreciation for the old willingness to co-create these interactions with us in an ongoing manner I ask you now how may I be observant to you feeling? in my train it was 4-3 so it's possible it would be the exact same time I was so sweet. So it was 4-3 so I went downstairs to the room and opened up the curtain to look at the sky. There were a lot of stars and I was looking at the stars and in the window pane I could see a reflection of my bed. And I noticed that I was sleeping in my bed. And then I realized my bed was there so I had a thought in my dreams that maybe I'm not really standing here physically. And then a car pulled up in the dream and I got very frightened because it was 4-3 in the morning. And my dog started to bark and waggartail but she knew who it was. And at that very moment here's where it came to. I woke up from the dream really, well, it was a dream. And I woke up by a very, very loud, very loud music that was playing in my ear and it was 50-3. And there was seven notes and I don't recall the tune right now. It was very loud and there was something that I don't remember all around me like a compressor chamber or something. I don't know how to describe it and I don't remember that part. But it stopped me and said, oh, I stopped and I still had my eyes closed them. Oh, right. Was that wasn't used? Yeah, it was a music of fun. That I brought notes. And then it happened again two seconds later. And at that moment I was afraid to open up my eyes. This is the same part. Because I thought I would wake up, I was wondering when I thought when I always went to eyes I would be in another reality. And that hurts. I don't understand that. But when I did open up my eyes, that empty, that appeared, that was right above my face. I'm letting go to the happy. Have binge, shall we say, the whole con? Was stepping you along with certain ideas? One, that you labeled, actual travel. Partially was that, although you did create that you are partially within a dream at that time. But second, recognize the distinction between what you labeled, your sleeping dream and your waking dream is simply that a distinction. In a sense, it is all one reality. As you do begin to move from your particular expression of reality, which we labeled third density into fourth density, still physical, more expanded. The idea of your sleeping dream and your waking dream no longer has that dividing line between them. And in a sense, many of you experienced this by quote, waking up into dreams. It's not at all uncommon. However, you are in communication as you have been with a particular entity that you have made and the green is with. And at your allowance of expand, you are enabling yourself, shall we say, to partake of different training type experiences to allow you to facilitate these communications. However, you have chosen to label certain occurrences within these parameters, extraneous. For instance, you are being awake when you are supposed to have been asleep. Trust yourself, trust your rhythmic cycle, trust your body. Because only your society, that says, should not be up at 3am. In actuality, the way your body functions, you are a heightened sense of physical, mental and spiritual, shall we say, expansiveness at 3am in your morning. What's that about? Yes, and when I did, then I did get out of bed. And for about 2 hours, everything looks very unreal. All right. As it is. Yeah. What was the answer? The answer is to be... Thank you very much. The idea of being a recollection, shall we say, of a particular tune that had meaning to you. In a sense, within what you would label a previous incarnation, with that entity. Whereby you are contemporary, shall we say. Thank you. Was that out? Yes. It is in a sense, A.T. It will give you the ability to lock onto that frequently-ceiled vibration. But we suggest again, enjoying the tune. Do not have to be glad it's gone. The part that I forgot or can't describe, do you know what that is? It's happened with the music, it's something. Again, that connection, the idea of that connection. There are specific timing playing out in when you allow yourself to discover certain things, to allow again the atmosphere to be most conducive to fulfill your dream. Thank you. Thank you very much, Sherry. For sure. Yes. Hello. As of you, good day. I just wanted to share with you that during the week or during the month, I write down certain things or questions that I want to ask you. And always, there's someone that comes into my life or I take that I put on, that answers the question. So I just wanted to share that with you. Thank you very much and understand that the access- we have constantly, for lack of a better terminology, the totality of the consciousness of our stream to you and your planet. How you will allow that to be acceptively presented to you will vary. But very often again, you set up scenarios to answer your own questions, because all I have ever actually doing is answering your own questions that you already know the answers to, but are using me, quote, using me as an acceptable symbol to reflect them back to you. And in a sense, that is set up within your entire reality. But we have, shall we say, an assistant type stream, which is always available to anybody who wishes to communicate with us. And many do on different levels with different propestities to walk onto this from time to time. But again, remember, you cannot formulate the idea of a question without already containing the answers. Thank you, Loni. Do you have another question? No, not a different one. All right, thank you very much for your share. For, we do appreciate when individuals always shape, state and share who they are. It's not that you really need us, and we appreciate when you are willing to share with us as an equal. For that is what will allow us to communicate with you at a more blatant physical level. As long as you think you need us in a sense then saying we are better than you, we will not interact face to face. When you realize that we are simply your equal, we will. But we will not come down and save you, for nobody needs any savings. Thank you very much. Thank you, Jesus. And in a sense, share. And to allow them through will, in a sense, determine the timing. So we trust them perfectly. Did you have more specific questions? Well, yes, more like what a possible format would be. Hold on. One of the ideas that we will, when timing allows, communicate to your society, is the idea of working or playing in triumph. Very often within your planet, individuals on a one-to-one basis, do create conflict, do create struggle, do create fighting, and one way for individuals. To be able to, in a sense, sober up and listen to each other is to allow a third individual to, in a sense, mediate. Therefore, not in a judgmental way. In a way simply to lie down the facts as they are, allowing both individuals to see the full picture. And this in a sense is a technique which we will, at some time, share with you that idea of the methods of, for lack of a better terminology, mediation. For now, battle is. I like that I do. I do. I do. Very well. Thank you very much. In a sense, you do function in that mode from time to time. Very good. Thank you very much. Is that all? Thank you very much. Sharing. All right. The person that we know is Gandhi. Would that be a person who you would say walks in here, so that it relates to the peace that he believes? In a sense, yes. That is one example. There is not again just one way for peace either. But shall we say one of the more visible examples of walking your talk? Thank you. Thank you very much. Yes, to sure. Yes. We spoke last interaction a little bit about teleportation. Yes. And I had some experiences when I was younger. Oh, you're sharing. Well, I thought they were pretty neat. Oh, and they were. I went through a period where I would seemingly pass out for no reason at all. That does happen to the physiological channel from time to time. So having a little thought. But while I was passed out, it seemed to me that I was in a different location. I was either floating on the ocean or doing something that I enjoyed. And when I came back to consciousness, I had full memory of being there. But there seemed to be no reason for me to have passed out in the first place. All right. In a sense, it was that time of exploration. But we sense what you are speaking of is more where you would label the astral ideas. But when you are in your astral form, many of what you label your physicalized sense is still in a sense, on presence. And it's easy to shall we say confuse one idea to the other until you get used to it. Well, Matt, what's my question for this one or the other? I have a perception that the idea of astral travel, as we have explained, that is not true even mechanism. But you understand? Yes, I do. Thank you. Thank you very much. Sure. Yes, ma'am. I have a few questions. One of which I used to have a lot of dreams that I was able to fly in the sky. I mean, I'm not sure if that's weird or not. No, not at all. They commented in your society. And they symbolized several things. New proceeds. I used to feel like it was easy just to just decide, okay, I'm going to fly in the sky. And I can do it. And I can physically just say, okay, I will now be in the sky instead of right here on the ground without any problem. And I have to dream safe to have. And I'm not sure what that means. Recognize. Everybody present in this interaction has at some point, astraly traveled in that sense. In a sense, it's a seeming that you never leave. In a sense, your consciousness is not within your body to begin with. Your body is within your consciousness. So mechanically, that is not what we mean, however. But what you do not do is bring back the conscious recognition that you have done so. Generally, you will bring back acceptable symbols as the most common form, this acceptable symbol, let's say, is what you label as dreams. So in a sense, most of the time that most of you do experience what you label flying dreams, you are out and about. It's simply that what you bring back is a representational memory. Sometimes these experiences, however, occur within a framework that there is nothing to compare it to when brought back to this reality. So shall we say your mind as you have created yourself to have a mind, provide certain symbols that are close. Therefore, you bring back a particular memory which is in a sense but a shadow of the experience you have had. And in a sense, this is ongoing. Many of the dreams you bring back as solid dreams in a sense were non-physical experiences with no frame of reference. Therefore, you bring back acceptable familiar, common symbols so that you have something you can chew on. When you are reflecting in this reality, do you still from time to time do that within your dreams? Yes. Sometimes I still do. I feel like it's actually happening with my gender dreams deeply, and after feels like it's the reality. Then it goes, well, recognize that that's what you are in a sense out. And if you allow yourself to become conscious to in a sense, wake up in the dream, you can experiment with this idea. And that doesn't very real sense free you up for in the actual state. Flocks are things. This is why dreams, the way you label them are somewhat confusing. As you think something, it's then immediately with no intervening time table manifest. That is why it is hard to maintain what you consider to be your focus in a sweeping dream as your thoughts have changed the quote, steam also changes, and you are used to having a more steady reality and sort of in a sense lose track. But that is far more your natural state anywhere, and this is far less colloquially seeking your natural state. This is a very highly defined sense of focus whereby you only choose to be able to perceive one thing at a time. You see one thing at a time, and that to us is quite unnatural. So therefore, as you begin to expand in this waking dream, you allow yourself, act as few more symbols to make the connection between your sleeping dreams. You are dreaming right now. Simply you can wake up and live the dream that you are, and then you will no longer experience the separation of night dream, day dream. You will in a sense of falling into a constantly ongoing day dream that has some of the aspects of what you consider to be this solid world, but many more of the aspects of what you consider to be your dream world, this is the reality that we live in, and in a sense you would perceive us as dream life. To us we are very solid, very physical. You are dream life, but that is the meaning ground for us. So that helps. Yes, it does, man. Two other questions. All right. One is that it is wondering about sometimes I will feel and so that you might have had the same feeling. It is sensitive, not vibration, but English conversation. How will that? In what portion of your body, I have it happen when I experience an emotional consciousness of some sort about something that I have seen visually, and something that I don't think, how to describe it, or how to describe it, but something that has affected my being, I still have to describe it, something that is affecting me to have a sensational feeling for whatever it is that I am visually looking at. All right. It is quite good. What was your question about this idea? Is it sort of, have anything to do with consciousness? Oh, yes, it all does. The idea of being as you expand your consciousness and open up, shall we save, a possibility for communication, you will experience activations of particular of what you label energy symptoms within your body, particularly the upper portion. So it would not be in a sense too unusual to experiencing what you label a feeling like, a litric, lycin patients within the area of your solar, your heart, your throat area. Is any of this of which you speak? Sort of, I guess the way I can give you the question more directly is, if you see a bloody confrontation, people hurting each other, that is what brings that feeling of positive sensation, which you are trying to explain to me. That is simply the idea of, because of your bully system, viewing a situation, figuring out how it relates to you, and then creating the corresponding physical eye sensation that you sometimes may label fear, sometimes may label anger, but it simply again is, as all other ideas and opportunities, very often the exploration may simply be, to find out, I don't prefer that, and that's it. Does that help? Are you answering the question? I think you have to respond. If you can be a bit more specific than we can address the point more specifically. I'm not sure how to be specific. Well, if it comes up, I volunteer that information and question number three. My last question is, I'm interested in, I constantly thought about past lives, if I haven't thought about before, and I'm wondering if you can tell me anything about that. Since we decide you all have everything you do need at this moment to live this particular life, the fullest and the best that you can. Not to validate the idea of past lives, future lives, open in existence, but everything is simultaneous anyway. When you are on reaching certain explorations, there may be particular experiences which have a certain degree of significance or relevance to where you're at now that would be having have happened in, as you say, a packed life. And it may, in a sense, aim you in order to make these connections, recollections, explorations, but it is not that it is necessary to know two proceeds, the way that any individual can establish a sense of their past life, is simply to validate your imagination. What do you feel most strongly an attraction for, which period in time? It is no coincidental accident that you feel that way, and individuals are most strongly tuned to these ideas. It may simply allow themselves to validate what you get. For instance, what do you feel most strongly was a packed life experience? I'm not sure. All right? Close your eyes. Relax. Allow your mind to drift. The first picture of what you had labeled a period in your timetable that comes to you. Tell me without invalidating it, without analysis. What is the first era you do see? Can't really see anything. All right. Do it again. Do you have an attraction for what you labeled? Egyptian period of time. All right. We see a most strong connection with that idea. When I say that to you, what images come into your mind? Very good. Describe. Walk into the cave. Describe and validate what you get. It seems like this cave would bring things sticking out. Very good. Is there anything upon what you labeled a wall? No, but there is a very hard day of striving more than that. Oh, it doesn't have to be. It's up to you. If we allow your imagination, free brains, we see very strong connections to the period you labeled, Egyptian. We see very strong, very strong connections in what you labeled, and what you have learned from your own imagination. Allow your imagination to bring the detail to you. It's not that we are hesitant to share our perception with you. It's simply that our job is to allow you to take back your power and the more you leave these interactions with, being able to do by yourself in a sense, the more successful I have been at my job. All right. Thank you very much. Thank you. I have a daughter who has been experiencing growing pains, and she calls in her hands, mainly in the width down and the angles down. At night when she's sleeping, she'll wake up screaming. I've been to many doctors. I can give her a three or four baby ass things to find. But there's something deeper. I've been to people who said that one person is particular to me, something in a past like came into this life, and she hasn't dealt with it yet, due to a culture that's been where they took their hands and they feed off the people. It's very hard for me to deal in this life with that. I wonder if you know where the cleaning is from. All right. In a sense, we also perceive all without being that specific, drama in those areas, in pretty this time, and however, where have you brought this individual? I pray it's blood, bone, and nerve. To which, as you say, physicians? Their names? No, their specialties. Oh, gosh. Art and I'm really doctoring the other hand. A blood specialist in New York, in case it was blood, you know, description. I recently have a... Then we will suggest that there are individuals present with the ending of your time who can be a service to you. If we allow them to do so, all right? Thank you very much for trusting. Sharing. Just a question for fun. All right. Just a question. For fun. For fun. Where's Elvis? One month. In a sense, what you would label the individual Elvis, for lack of a better terminology, is the residing within what you are labeled non-physicality. Which, shall we say, a strong tendency toward reincarnated, but this has not necessarily been decided. For many individuals that are in that state, and have many individuals upon a planet focusing upon them, shall we say, is allowed to explore certain things from those interplains of energy, and in a sense, from time to time that may hold one, in a sense, loosely speaking, into that place or state. Then for there was some confusion with the idea of the transition, but that had largely cleared up at this point from what we are perceiving. What the hell? Thank you very much. At this time, we will pause for a short break, and to 15 of the ordinance, and we will resume contact at that time.
