 How will you all the evening of your time? You can create time to exist. Thank you very much. We begin this introduction this evening of your time with the entitlement. Unconditionally yours. Alumni to engage in a brief discussion of the idea you label God which we refer to call all that is. Although sometimes we do refer to God all that is as infinite creation or simply the universe. For all that is is truly all that is. Everything within existence is part and parcel of all that is. You are all in that way also part of God or all that is. Therefore there is nowhere within creation existence or for that matter non-existent. That is not within the whole within God if you will. Therefore understand the mechanism through which all that is created. Reality if you will. And from shall we say the energy the white light energy of unconditional love. For that emotion that idea that energy of unconditional love is in fact what allows for what you label the property of attraction. Allowing for the idea of bodies, vibletory, representations to come together. The idea of not only love but unconditional love. And what this simply means is that God or all that is always loves all of creation. Do understand the ramifications of this idea. For in your society you have many versions of what you label on. You have many ideologies as shall we say. Directions in which one is able to choose and view God. But do understand from our perspective when beginning to assign to God human qualities such as judgment. You are in that sense not recognizing that you are made in the image and likeness of God. In fact when individuals are willing to believe that God will judge you and not in that sense. Unconditionally love you. You are creating God in man's image. Understand what you label God in again we will now continue to call all that is. For this bit more discretes is non-conditional. Is non-judgmental. It recognizes in every given moment that all is departed and never makes the idea of a distinction that you would call a separation. It always although being each and every aspect of creation at the same time still has the ability for self-reflection. To view itself as and colloquially speaking individuals. Therefore you too being in the image and likeness of God has unlimited capability and the ability to be self-aware. Self-reflected. However by the very nature of your existence you have chosen to separate colloquially speaking yourself from the idea of God so that you can colloquially speak expedient reality as though you are separate from it. What this allows you to do is have the steamingness of existing within a reality as part of it rather than recognizing that in shall we say actual reality any reality that you create emanates from you. You are not within it. It is within your consciousness and so this is true for what you believe in your soul. For very often individuals will say well I have a soul and it resides within my body. Alright. If you believe that you can experience satisfaction. However mechanically speaking that is not quite accurate. For the shall we say truth of the matter again recognizing the relativity of truth is that your body exists within your consciousness. And therefore in that sense you are not locked in a body. You are simply choosing within the totality of your consciousness to express a portion of it by being this body. That in and of itself is seemingly a separation. And therefore you do perceive yourself at times as being separate from God. But in actuality even when you are viewing yourself as such you are by definition still one with God and looking at that idea. For you create your reality through your beliefs. The idea is everything in creation from the perspective of all that is is equal. For everything is all that is. So therefore the practice of assigning varying values to things within creation is a man named process and not a God named process if you will. Therefore again when you do recognize that something is separate from yourself that is all well and good and falls under the category of observation. I am that I am not this. But when you then take what you are not and in that way feel that qualitatively it is less than you. You are judging it that is judging separation not recognizing the oneness of all things and allowing yourself to see that some things are better than others. Do recognize however that even if you are willing to do this all that is does not and is non judge mental. Your physical saying judge let TV judge does not truly mean in the way that it was transmitted that if you judge you will be judged by God. As we have said God is unconditional non judge mental. What it means is that when you are willing to judge others you become the vibration of judgment and therefore can only attract to yourself judgment or the opportunity to continue to judge. But recognize although you may choose to a time that that judgment is coming from God it is not. God loving you unconditionally means no matter what you choose to explore no matter what you choose to explore God will still love you. Now you may not continue because of what you developed to be in your society morals to love yourself if you perceive that you have done something that is in your society concerned very bad. And therefore again very often individuals will assign that God is judging me I'm in trouble for recognizing they are doing the judging from their own framework of morality that they have bought into. Therefore God loves you so much that he allows you to experience any degree of separation without interference any degree of limitations without interference. Now when we say interfering what we need is all that is still give you the opportunity in whatever you are creating to have that creation supported by the universe most fully in that sense is in full swing with what you are doing. But the idea is that. You ultimately choose the reality you will experience and no matter what you choose will be 100% supported by the universe by infinite creation. So therefore you will always have the 100% shall we say support of all that is to explore whatever it is you are exploring and if negativity is what you are exploring the form that that support takes is what you put out is what you will get that. For that is the only one law that transcends all reality all dimensions of existence all planes of existence what you put out is what you get back. Therefore that is in a way the law that you have all agreed to abide by and therefore if you choose in that way to put out negativity you will experience it but you are still the one making the decision. Subsequently when you choose in that way to lead a positive integrated life you will also be supported most fully to be able to continue to do that same and this is unconditional law. Although perhaps in some sense an aspect of all that is does not like in that sense to see its creation causing themselves to suffer it is so unconditional that it will even allow them to explore that. Now we seem to think in your society in general individuals and purposes as being indifferent or cold but it is not it is being so ultimately supported to not in that sense dictate what one can or cannot do simply allow you to explore whatever it is you choose. And in that sense because what you put out is what you get back if you do choose positivity if you do choose to integrate your reality then you will experience that support from all that is in a positive way. And in your society you tend to label that God is helping me when you get the positive feedback but when you put out a negative you get the negative feedback God is ignoring me. Now it's working in both cases however you will always have the opportunity to make the original sound the echo that comes back from all that is will be determined according to your choice of negative and positive. Again all situations in your life all situations are but a neutral set of props with absolutely zero meaning you assign the meaning the meaning you assign to the effect you get out so therefore with any given neutral situation you give a negative definition you will add we mean get a negative effect. If you take however the same exact neutral situation recognizing that there is negative things you can glean from it but beginning now to be a bit more creative and beginning now to look at the positive things that it has allowed you to do the belief that it has allowed you to see that you still have that are limiting you are assigning a positive meaning to the neutral symbol and then will only receive a positive effect. And it works across the board automatically whether or not you choose to pay attention to it it works any way. What the knowledge we are imparting allows you to do is begin to become conscious creating yours. You create automatically any way. Now we introduce to you the idea that you can create according to your preference rather than in that way feeling that life is automatic and has its ups and downs. You can create that but the ups and downs are not necessary you do not need to create downs to balance out the ups many. You know if you buy into that you can create that way always but that is only a belief. So therefore if you will begin to simply fear what we are saying that all that is is Unconditional you will begin to understand that you do not have to seek a relationship with all that You already have one and no matter what you have ever ever done You have had the unconditional love from all that is to continue to do that thing and that All right, but in your vernacular code of non-inference is in that way evidence of unconditional love Remember again Unconditional love means you are loved no matter what Conditional love means if you do this thing I will love you if not your stink Do recognize that is a belief you do not in that way need to buy into it You know that it's a factor quite real what you do, but it is not Again recognizing That you may create God in the image of man You can also understand that you are created in the image of God and therefore any Quality that you ascribe to all that is all gone or Contain within and can be expressed Begin now to feel that unconditional love that no matter even if you choose In that sense to hate yourself You are still robbed by all that is on Conditional If you will again begin to become conscious of that unconditional love You will recognize that you always have the ability to define your relationship with all that is You can't accept the father sibling, but you can also be friends You can also be any Relationship that you wish and if you will but look at your relationship to all that is In the way that you find would be most favorable and then act as though you already believe it You will get that effect right now and again no matter what you choose will still be Unconditionally loved and not judged You too can now choose to not judge When you are judging another when you are judging a circumstance you are saying this is not me But then ascribing a lesson value to it If you will merely make the observation that this is not me and not take the next step of invalidating You will be equalizing you will be viewing it seeing how it pertains to you Seeing what you can use from it and if you can use nothing Recognize it has allowed you to define yourself still further. I do not prefer this thing therefore I know more about myself Self-discovery self-defamation will always be a result of any of this willingness to act in this way So therefore you can take any situation that happens in your life and recognize that you Assign the means that you need not judge When individuals do judge in general This stems from their judgments of themselves if all that is refuses to judging no matter what You may now begin to think that you have the option to treat yourself with the same respect If you will begin to in that way be bold about what you believe be proud about who you are Then you will have no need to judge yourself You will have no need to create the any motion of guilt and understand from our perspective again Guilt not a is the true opposite of love For guilt implied all lack of self-worth Hey, although I polarized expression of love still has some deserve ability in there Therefore when you find yourself experiencing guilt Understand in that moment you are not granting yourself the same respect that God granted you are not loving yourself unconditionally You are not allowing yourself to see for instance that you have done something that you would prefer to no longer do Already done already in that way as played out the reasons for having done it. You can't change that thing you have done Therefore you can even be guilty about it or you can use it if you are willing to take something that you have been guilty about and no Longer performance it has served a great purpose You have balanced it out Carmically speaking you do not need to experience each and everything one for one pit for half Simply the learning of a lesson in the building is to apply the learning of that lesson is balanced so therefore in any given now moment of your existence you always have Everything you need to create from that moment on and if you will plug in Unconditional love in your endeavors lack of willingness to judge things as less than other things You will begin to flow in your life using the same quality displayed by all that is and it is that Again no matter what you choose to do is up to you We never do insist that you believe what we are saying because we are saying this for we are not the point I can never convince you of what I am saying anyway, and it is not my goal to do so I can however guarantee you 100% That if you will be willing to put what we say into action You will 100% get that result So therefore it will never be a goal on my hand to convince you there will be a goal on my end Have you changed the beliefs you have? Simply allow you to know that if you do choose these reality they will work and you can prove it to yourself At this time We wish now to extend our unconditional love and appreciation to you For your willingness to begin to open up to the many more aspects that you are Although within this exploration of this lifetime you have imposed upon yourself for the purposes of this exploration much seeming limitation much so That is simply the definition of this exploration and you although one of the forgetfulness is you sometimes imposes this choose it If you will begin to act as though you choose it you will begin to own your young if you begin and continue to say Poor little old me you will get that reality For God loves you that much to allow you to even all right wallow in the muck Again we understand this may seem like indifference, but if you will truly look at What is granted to you? the gift of free will You will understand that if you are creating a life you do not refer it is not God's fault It is God's allowance to even let you create that and if you will be willing to own it yourself You can change it you already have created it away it is so again in our exchange within our appreciation for your willingness to Allow interactions between your society and our respective society I After now how may I be a service to you? Your desire and willingness to share what you share with us thank you very much in this very exciting to us and because we always do in any given moment what it's like Recognizing that that is our indication of what is most often any given second. It is my pleasure a little feedback to you recently I had Going forward just a little snack after school with a classmate of mine Oh, I can you all hear listen to the video? Speak up people so that only shit in conversation she was She has been going through many difficult things and in conversation with her. She started bringing up things about karma She was carrying with certain individuals from past life and And just in passing I mentioned to her that she didn't have to be content herself with her past life so much being more concerned with where she is now and she was very look at me very puzzled and kind of took it in but Just had a positive question and conversation went on from there The following evening and she said to me Thank you very much to what I have said very helpful to her so in an indirect way You sharing what you share with us sharing Down the road anyway Full-borne willingness to act for your in-house Transmission of the information from your end is action and again all of these ideas sound white nice It will always be the actions that creates them into your reality. They say philosophy until you do them Then they are physics mechanics, but do understand In your religion that speak of the idea of the law of karma In general most do not make it to the advanced class to find out the bottom line about common Your Eastern Masters well-known Notice but in that sense are not always sharing it with others and that is it While you are within the framework of karma you can create it to be quite real in fact You will seem to exist with it as a law But when you get to the end of the cycle of karma you get to find out this little idea karma is self-imposed and And this in that way is not taught very often Therefore the mere recognition that karma is self-imposed Reempowers you do not use your karma as an excuse in the presence do not do what you wish to do in the present Yes, thank you very much. It's a good time. I do have a situation going on with another present that Perhaps you can help me with And it goes in line with what you're thinking of this unconscious her love She's a person I care about very very much But I have a little difficulty being around her because I find she judges everyone very harshly and I know that this comes from within her and In general, yes, and we may say that she judges herself very harshly But you understand that judgment in a sense what are coming between two individuals is into steps judgment rendered by an individual Judgment accepted by the other and therefore you will always have the power within your reality Do not accept it do not buy into their when you learn in that way to do so and Will be willing to display it in action. They will be very shocked very popular and in New reality They will see doing so for they only continue to do so when they get a certain effect and if you are refusing to participate In giving that effect they do not in that sense have the feedback to continue to judge So you may then find that individual may continue to judge others and we'll see Judge Justice or not on me there there are about other people She reflects them to me in the sense that she will say oh, what do you think about someone so all thereby giving in your Opportunity to share your perspective and if it is non judgment again getting her to options And I do try to do that with you not try well I do do that with her I did do that And then while you are being the strongest rewatching that you can't before us We have said you cannot convince anyone of anything you can simply give them the gift of your sharing Give them the gift of your perspective by not insisting that they take it You read the most conducive atmosphere to allow them to take it if they wish Yeah, I kind of what I So what we are saying is he found up your doing just fine You will notice And you will in that sense begin to have the opportunity to share perspectives with that individual that are all part of it Thank you In that sense you do not have to look forward to it is right now But we understand and we can share Okay, so that interaction a lot of things It has been very thing I was looking at As a man do someone this is in a set way That is Don't How You Wait rather than death. If you stand up, you're weak. I, I, I, It's insane because I feel very norm and very tight. Oh, I just want to know your feeling, uh, I do understand. Perhaps this will in the sense, that this should be. Anxiety and excitement are the same energy. One with a positive interpretation. One with a negative. So understand. You are feeling and dying in general. You are invalidating what it's like to. And by that single recognition, you may need to do so. And we get involved. Do go on. Oh, I started with one of the other night. I was leaving. I was laying on a cashline. And I was just putting out a commensative. When I heard for Wednesday night, I mean, and they were, I wasn't dreaming. I was already, I was already, I was always thinking, oh, and I feel it in my spirit guide, but I just want to know if the facts are gonna be a huge change. Now do you understand? We do choose in that way to share with you. However, we now give you the opportunity to empower yourself. What do you think? Can you, can you validate that? So do you recognize, however, you will only ever in any given situation. Get an outer or external reflection of validation where you first inwardly validate. Therefore, yes. Thank you for your willingness to be bold and to understand that as you validate what you get, you get motivated. And to share it. What you're not doing? My mother just missed me. Oh. Yeah, I had a problem. I was down in the morning. I was in a meditation. I had a question. And do you all understand? I feel, I feel, I feel like, I feel like I've come up with a clear question. I feel, I have no problem. I've gone by my daughter, and I saw, I got a lot of education at night, and I was a mother person at the same time, that I was a mother's family and I believed she was a child with women five or seven, five or seven, and I don't know if I was a mother's stereotype. In a sense, yes. I don't remember that much, but I know feelings of that person. That is the reason that when it is also loosely speaking, the DNA spirit got in the other hand, and that is why it looked familiar to me. I just have a lot of fear, and I know, you know, I know a lot of things. I want to, I may think that I know I question and but I just want to know if I'm not prepared. First of all, understanding is no right to me at all. You can validate anything that you feel in that way, that no such thing is I will carry on. Therefore, your question is quite fine. From our perspective, yes. However, being somewhat unprepared mentally for the pathogen is a bit of orientation taking place. There is the assistance in that way of what you label spirit of God. Do you understand? We have said that karma itself in public. However, when individuals do not know this, they create it, and therefore it seems in that way that there are certain effects in lives that may come from other lives. These shall we say, loosely speaking, the motionlessness between you was a carryover from momentum in another life. Again, you do not realize that by timing that karma was self-imposed and we're not able in that sense to transform the process. However, as well as that individual having had in that way caused so much pain and separation, the idea of the coma you may look at as it is. Poor in that sense it has been allowed many shall we say. Three unions. Is there a specific question? I know that. I don't know if the question is but I know that. Yeah, I do not know. My mom came out with my mom. She opened her eyes so hard to swim. She's been invited to work. In a sense, yes. Can you now share with me the gift of the Reunion? I feel like we're taking two weeks to meet the one of our state each month. I feel like we're taking two weeks to meet each month or so. I feel like we're taking two weeks to meet each month or so. I feel like we're taking two weeks to meet each month or so. I feel like we're taking two weeks to meet each month or so. They thought we needed a date. And to reintegrate, I look down the windows and see if they get that correct. Yeah. Then by quieting. Once in that state able to let go of the specific limitations of the lifetime and middle thing within the last day, give ideas. I have more questions. Oh. My friend, Dylan, I was at a 30th grader with 10th grader. And then by the end. And then by the end. Then by the end. Me and the men's state have very hard limitations on our lives. And by the end. And I have a big amount of questions for the people. We thank you very much for your willingness to share things which are so costly. Do you understand there are many reasons within a lifetime that individuals which choose to play perpetrating. Which seems in that sense to experience victimhood. But in a sense, all in the end winds up as one integrating home. There are many, many things that you can dream from your memories of this individual. The negative in that way would seem quite obvious. Therefore, you need not spend an in order not a time on the obvious. Begin to see what these things actually allowed you to do. The people it allowed you to do. The things that allowed you to believe. The way it allowed you to grow. And you will be greeting positive means from a neutral symbol which in your society is 99% of the time ascribed quite a bad animal. Again, you know what was bad about it. Allow yourself now to experience of what service it was to you and you will be owning everything you have created in your life. Also, move forward with what you learned from it. And remember, when determining the purpose of your life, all you need is relaxing to decide what excites you the most that is your purpose. In any given moment from what is immediately available to do at that moment, choose which one excites you and you will at every given moment be being most fully you. And those things, though they may seem to have nothing to do with your obligations, will always lead you into the situation to provide the abundance to even meet those obligations. When you will look at your obligations as the primary focus of your life, you will continue to create more obligations. When you will use excitement as your guide your grammar, the obligations will be met for the universal always support any idea you are being most fully literally and you will create more excitement rather than a cycle of obligation. So therefore, by being willing to establish what excites you and then do it, act it you are validating yourself as much as possible. And acting as though a person who believes in who you are, who would you chose to be in this life. For as we have said, your excitement is your indication of the purpose of your life, both overall and in any given moment. Is that so? She turned you into a group of students. Could you? As we knew. A vision? Can you tell us something about the history of judgment? In a very long history, for it is one of the separate aspects that allows you to create physicality. In that way, when you would loosely label the fall from grace, which by the way is from our perspective a misunderstanding is representative of the point at which individuals were willing to judge others. But the idea is what has become known as a fall from grace is a judgment of your choice to descend into this reality to experience it. When you realize you've chosen an act that way, you have a joyous life. When you refuse to think that you would choose such a thing, you judge the very creation you are within us being less and expedient in that life. The idea in our perspective of original sin is a gross misrepresentation. For you are originally unconditionally loving white wine. And therefore have not fallen in any sense. The only higher and lower is that you slow down, if you will, your vibrations to become physical. As your vibration increases, you become more increasingly non-physical. So in that sense, you are stepping down your vibrations, but in no way is that they fall from a better place to where you are falling. That is a judgment. So therefore you can't say it throughout the beginning. The moment man was willing to judge himself, and others, is shall we say that point? Does that help? That helps a great deal, thank you very much. Further question of my mind, and that is, I'm sure all of us that experience ourselves being judged metal, perhaps several dozen times a day, how? In practical terms, how does it not integrate over the judge? Well first of all, the first step will always be when you find yourself judging and understanding, you do not wish it to not judge yourself from judging. That can count the judgment. That does not allow you to learn about why you just judge, and what you can do in the future to not do so. That just allows you to again, mama. So therefore the first step is to not judge yourself from having judged. The second step is again to begin to question yourself back to your beliefs, for they are always what create your reality. Therefore, one must be believing in this moment to be judging that thing, and beyond that is all. You will learn something about a belief that you have, that you may no longer wish to perpetuate for, it is in limiting belief. And then again, once you own any belief, you can change it, but not until you own it. And this even means the beliefs you do not prefer to have. Very often individuals will not admit to themselves the beliefs that they have, that they do not wish to have, but then they can't change them. So recognize right now that in most livelihoods in the way you create your society, you do contain at least a few beliefs that you do not prefer to contain. Allow them to now come to the surface in a very flowing open way, and you will mind to enforce yourself, to shape yourself, and create this easy force yourself to know. All right. All right. And we thank you. Over there, Emmanuel. For sure. Yes. I'm a therapist, and I work with people who have very negative perceptions about themselves. And I see the misthinking, and I want to point out that these are just ideas that these people have taken on as their choice to view themselves negatively. And I see it so clearly, and I point it out, and I feel like I'm a teacher, and yet it's part of me that feels very controlling because I see it, and I want them to see it as clearly as I see it, and I know I should live and live, and allow people to be in the space that they are at the moment, and yet I'm seeing what I see, and I want to help. And again, the way that it says is wrong to have compassion. That is why in that way, in an ethnic state of goodness. But perhaps you can share with them a few shall we say simple, fundamental, like this. First of all, what you put out is what you get there. Therefore, however you feel about yourself, you will become that vibration. You can only experience a reality in you on the vibration. So therefore, if you are unwilling to love yourself, you will draw to yourself, subtracting yourself, reflections from without of that lack of self love, which can also come as lack of love from others. Do you recognize again your quality of relationship? You will always be a one-to-one reflection of your primary relationship. Therefore, it is an equal idea. I love myself. I hate myself. You can choose easily. And recognize again that if you choose to hate yourself, you will become that vibration, and only experience that reality. You may in that way impart the urgency to them of how we would serve them to at least look at the old person. Again, briefly, what you label soul makes, where people say they need someone else to make them complete, is an irony. Forward, when attracting individuals from a feeling of incompleteness, you will only attract a reinforcement of those feelings of incompleteness. When you are willing to establish that primary relationship with yourself, you will then be that vibration and only attract to your reflections of that other 100% whole beings, willing in that way to celebrate your whole being. But one thing may find helpful is in line with what you are saying. You can never, never, never be responsible for someone else. Responsible to them? Yes. Responsible for them? No. You can't, however, be responsible for yourself by being willing to be, whoever you are in that moment, most full. And looking at yourself as they hear, give most freely of yourself to them without insisting they need taking. That is the most obvious you can be up to them. And you are willing this to be an example of what you speak is the strongest symbol. They will then say, look, this person actually is this way, leads the life they prefer. They are proof to me that this can be done if I choose to do so. And that will always be a far stronger symbol than trying to choke it into them. Do you understand? Yes. Does that help? Yes. Shoking it into the really fifth. Do you recognize, however, that by doing so much? Well, it's better than getting into the whole thing. How do I do that? Yes. Be willing to live this way. Be willing to speak it. And then, if the gift is not received, that's all. If you have done your son, if you have done what you created yourself into the situation you do. In that way, you have given an ultimate. But again, your willing is to live as that person will always be a stronger example. When you begin to be this way yourself, believe me, they will want to know all. And then you will not need to convince anyone, since we tell them how you do this. Is that very simple? Yes. Thank you. As you do. Chill. Shri. I would like to announce the empty name. Oh, very exciting. Do you personally? His name is Akati. One more time. Akati. Lara. Akati. Akati. Akati. Akati. Akati. Akati. Do you envision that voice, Me? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I'm sorry. And before you proceed, please, I will tell you. I'll still do it. I'll never be on my way to my name. If there is some endeavor, you are about to embark upon. Yes. All right. Can you do this? I just had you think of cards right now. I just had you think of cards right now. Here's a there. I'll be able to alternate there. So, if you're a parent who works with another parent, then have this one here and I need another card. So, I just need to go counseling and the last card is a challenge. And you are there to make a statement to put it out there and you have just done both in your audience and your cards I take. Therefore, we thank you for your ability to boldly be strong and suggest that any individuals that you attract for this service, you will be able to 100% assist and read and power. Thank you so much. Shit! Sure. Yes. How do you do that? I would just like to share with you that I have this reaction to the sense that I have this language that I'm not aware of or if it's not really. And I was very pleased with the time and I went home and I made a very good, very good, exciting thing. I had too much specific experience in my life work. And I made my myth and then the day where I spoke a little bit about a day, and I'm going to go home for a minute, and maybe wear a situation that can become very exciting. Thank you so much for your willingness to again go forth boldly and recognize you already in what explanation is just in your society. You are not taught to recognize it. Not taught to acknowledge it. You can. Anytime. Recognize. One of the notions sometimes mumps in your reality with following your excitement is, oh that's a bit too brittle. Oh my. But when you are following your excitement with integrity, which is what we always latch on to the idea, you are never harming yourself or others than always being of positive service, as well as only being willing to be in any moment who you are. If that's your reality, I'll say something. Have we? Is that all? And do you? Share it with me. Be sure. Yes. When you say that we have choice here, and we make and create our reality through our free will and choice, do you mean that quite literally is there any framework that we can talk before we come into this line to experience this higher self and influence? In a sense, but they are very generalized and broad ideas, so therefore important, may it be that your higher self slates and you will discover and explore abundance. Here it is. Therefore you may say you were predestined to explore abundance, but the idea is how you experienced that abundance, negative, positive will always be up to you. So with the fullest sense, it is always your choice to choose a life that will result in ecstasy and joy. Thank you. You can, in that sense, experience whatever the vague general things your higher self have determined with any quality you assign, negative, positive. Does that help? Yes. Have we done too? Very much. Do you recognize again that part of beginning to consciously create your reality is again your willingness to own what you have created by saying that doesn't belong, that states again. That is not only here. That is not using it. It is obvious what states the balance. Now see how it does you and that is using every creation, even if it only does you a little bit. You have to use it. And therefore by using what you do create your state of the universe, I am now willing to take back my responsibility as a creator. And you then begin to do it consciously according to preference. Automatically by following your excitement with integrity automatically you are choosing the most positive, joyful way to proceed. And again, excitement brings along with it three things. First of all, it is your indication that that thing is most you. The thing you chose in this lifetime is your experience and therefore most effortlessly. Second one, the universe always supports any idea that is being most fully. Therefore any abundance necessary for you to be. That idea will be forthcoming by definition. And thirdly it will always lead you to another opportunity. Another exciting thing. And therefore it is one string of exciting things after the next. What we have labeled when you are willing to do this 100% via static explosion of coincidence. And the reason we use this terminology is that things that seem to happen, the abundance that seems to come in the people that you seem to live along the way, seems to happen, lies the prize most co-incidentally. And you are not in that way. Dictating, I will only accept my abundance in this particular way. I will only accept this knowledge from that book and from other. You are now opening yourself up to any way that you can discover. By opening yourself up to the universe most fully. What you generally label vulnerability, then the universe withhold nothing from you. How are we talking about? Shail. Shail. Shail. I have a kind of network that is produced in Los Angeles. And she spoke to the channel recently. Do you have access to that knowledge through the channel? No. Tell me. Tell me how are you. We understand and proceed. Right. She asked if I asked a question or asked if the channel asked me to ask you the question. I think she asked the guys and the ladies and the sisters from the universe. Oh, in that sense that individuals have created a single human label, cancer. And so much has been discussed along with lines between the channel and that image. So we will simply in that way, synopsis on it. Recognize that anything in your reality is a symbol. Any symbol you create, you create to allow yourself to glean, to learn certain things. Once you accept any message that any symbol has to give, by definition it transforms. When you are unwilling to look at certain portions of yourself, for shall we say a long time, they then begin seemingly to be forced upon you to look at. And this een, as we have said, is one of those ways that individuals create to force themselves to look at certain areas. Again, looking at the neutral symbol is quite obvious what's the negative in your reality about it. But what does it allow her to do? What does it allow her to see about the way that she has been created by reality? What does it allow her to do now that she has the disease that she could not do before? Begin now to do that same first and you will have no need for the symbol to force you to do it. And one last time you... very often in your society, when individuals choose the symbol of this een, they are a sign, a quality, from yours to sign, a release of weakness. From our perspective, it takes infinite strength for an individual to create a this een. So, allow her again to be cognited of her infinite strength, her infinite ability to choose, her infinite ability to greenen from any symbol the positive reason for its manifestation, then by allowing it to transform. And also, may we come here. This is a very loving, beautiful, sharing individual. And there is no reason that she cannot transform that symbol in an acceptable way. We thank her for her strength and in that sense, willingness to explore that style of limitations. And again, by establishing what it allows her to do, and first, doing that thing, she will know all that has the need to have the symbol to force it upon her. And that is all. Thank you very much, and I thank her too. And to do you, how do I question you? Yes, I do. A little more on Jett. I did want to say that Jett, the purpose of Jett was created to keep us held in this third dimensional realm. In a sense, into the limited framework of third dimensional reality, you will still in that sense be in third transitional, fourth dimensional reality when you cease to judge. However, you will not have what you're able to be the limiting or negative effect of third. So there is more peace you focus in that style of third dimensional reality that is happening to you, I am within it, not from it. Yes, I was saying this may be one of the key is to support the density. Oh, it all is. It must have become non-judgmental. So the question of validating everything that you do and everything around you. And again, validating does not mean condoning that which you do not prefer and backing it up. But it's simply even using that to glean some portion of it, something that is relevant to you. The moment you do so, you have a louder to so you. Thank you very much. And to do you. Kid. Pastor. Gabe. The last time I was here with you, I shared with you that I was having trouble with my new path that I was on and having some kind of work with my actual reality, my life, the job and making money. And you said, are you following your bliss? And I said, no. And you said, well, when you do, all the spirituality and the fourth dimensional things will all come together. And so I gave you the courage to be the job that I have been in for 12 years without another job. Oh, fine. I was very, you know, tough-timed the economy and was good about three weeks now. And I know that's mentioned using nothing to pan down. I realized that I'm going to place a transition. I have come to realize that I cannot come up with an answer to this in my head. My intellect is not worth coming from. But I just have to trust that something is going to come from all of this. But you can, that says do something. And that is, of whatever is available in any given moment, what it's like to do. And to begin to do so, what you will set up will be a framework that will support you from excitement. If you begin in that sense to trust the old obligatory reality, you will create that, oh, that by sure was wrong and go back to your own mind. But to understand you are in that sense, if you choose to view it not in a position of weakness, you are in the ultimate position of strength to now create your life according to preference. In that way, as we have said, it is not so much the idea of burning from the reality you do not prefer, but walking to the one you do, making the one that you do the emphasis and not the one that you don't. The emphasis there by holding it with you. So begin by doing what it's like to do in any given moment, which may simply take a form of, you have, for instance, in a moment, free choices. I can go to the bathroom, I can eat, I can walk down the street, all right, which one excites me the most? The walk, okay, hey, this is the level we need, this is the one. You can hide out when you take that walk, for it will need you somewhere. Do not get hooked on the results that that particular walk must have in a certain effect, just begin to trust your excitement and watch what happens. All the tools you need will automatically be attracted to you. When you and that sense have collected them all, then the very job that you need in those very tools will be right there, if that is what it's doing. But again, we will always have the opportunity to create the old reality in a slightly different format for the new excited reality. Use your excitement. It works. It you learn. I have another question. If you will be willing to do so, please, in the future, share. You will not sense, be it at the moment. Do go on. My 14-year-old nephew was in a horrible car accident two days ago with four other boys, and they're all in the hospital, and it's a very, very bad state. Although they all live, and everyone is amazed, everyone is calling them a miracle kiss at the hospital because they all had their feet built on, but it's going to be a long, long way back to health. Can you give me any insight as to what we should be learning from this incident? In that sense, he will learn something different. He in that sense will have an opportunity to learn many things, having forced himself in the position of life still if he will for a long enough time. But how you will choose to relate to that particular symbol will be your explanation and your individual result. What has in that way it allowed you to learn so far? Again, it is most obvious what seems negative. Will you now allow yourself the opportunity to be what was positive? Yes. Anyone else in the question? Well, I started screaming our whole family together in a new and different way. It made me also look at the fact that I have a very hard time, although I have a desire to communicate with my nephew and other nephews and users that I have. I haven't been able to do that. I just haven't had the skills to do that, and I will look at that because I'd like to be able to communicate with him. I do have taken a single formally labeled negative and giving yourself gifts. You can continue this line of reasoning for it as an ongoing event, and therefore your relationship with it, how it serves you will be an arm going for that. In the same context, I guess, I had something else happen in the last few days. I found out that my son has been doing drugs, and I'm trying to look at it the same way. First off, at least now I have something tangible to hold onto, that makes us understand some of the behaviors that have gone on for the last two months. Is there any other things that you could give me that you could be looking at? Oh, yes. The idea being that each and every one of you creates your own reality. 100%. And if you only allow yourself to see that you only created 60%, 80%, you're still creating 100% all the time. What you label, drugs, are a symbol. They allow you in what you consider to be an externalized, accessible way to create a particular effect. However, the individual creates the effect, not the drug. Now, we understand again your society that many individuals will not believe this. However, it makes it no less true. Therefore, once an individual does get rid of this fact, they can understand that the symbol allows them to see something they can create by themselves. If you will act as an empowered individual, you can create the same effect without the symbol. Therefore, allowing the symbols to have served a purpose in recognizing that you can create your own reality in many ways. But you do not need to continue to latch on to the symbol. So our first suggestion would be the simple recognition, the important idea that they create the effect. And that is an externalized tool, and you always create your own reality in terms. Does that help at all? Thank you. And we thank you. At this time, we will form a straight short break. So 15 to 20 is the only reason we contact at that time.
