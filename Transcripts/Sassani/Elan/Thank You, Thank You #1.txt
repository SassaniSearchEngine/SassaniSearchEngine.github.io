 All right, I'll say, how are you all this evening of your time as you create time to exist? Thank you very much. We begin this interaction this evening of your time with the following entitlement. Thank you, thank you. Allow me to explain. We have often spoken with members of your society and reminded you about the idea that you do create your own reality. We have designated that most often up till now that is. In your society this has been done somewhat unconsciously. You have not even realized you created and therefore that would fall into the category of unconscious creation. You still create it even if you don't realize it. And there and then you do so and shall we say somewhat of a hodgepodge manner. You still create it but without having the conscious recognition that you do, you do not grant yourself the idea that you can do so according to preference. And therefore by harboring the notion that you must have approximately 50% good and 50% miserable. You do so in somewhat of shall we say again a non-preparential way at least 50% of the time when you are made aware of the fact that you do create your own reality bringing that again notion to the conscious forefront. You can then begin to create it consciously. However your strongest belief systems always create your reality. And you do have the notion within this particular focus of physical reality of momentum. The idea that once a particular momentum has begun it will play out. Therefore when you consciously begin to create your own reality there may seem to be an momentum from when you unconsciously created it. Now the good news is you can allow those creations which again seem it's only a seeming nest to have momentum the ideas which you do not prefer to transform. However you cannot do so by denying that you have them. You can use all your creations once you become conscious of the fact that you create your own reality. You then generate realities that you do prefer however you consciously use your creations all of them. Now again you create the seeming of momentum of particular ideas from when you quote unquote unconsciously created your reality. Allow me to share with you a very simple way to begin right now right now to integrate and transform those old momentum those old beliefs. The idea is again to use all your creations. Be willing to see that anything that is occurring in any now moment is your creation. Nothing nothing in creation is extraneous or pointless by definition if it exists it has a point. Therefore begin to use everything that exists. The things that again seem to have a momentum from your unconscious creatorhood tend to come up as seeming negative. When you label them negative you perpetuate that momentum. You are not using a creation by labeling it pointless extraneous or negative. So therefore when a reality comes along that on the surface on the surface seems like an unpreparential reality think again. Understand you have created it. Understand that if it seems pointless you are judging it from an old perspective. In fact you can take this one step further. When something comes along that again you seem to not prefer. Say thank you thank you. I now see that this is the timing to integrate this idea. I now know because it is happening right now and I am a conscious creator that now is the time to look at it and I thank you for bringing yourself to my awareness so I can transform what is left in my belief systems that I do not prefer what is left within my belief systems that still continues to limit me. And it can go something like this something again comes along that seems most unpreparential. You say thank you thank you. Now you do not simply stop at that point. You ask yourself in order for me to be interpreting this thing as negative or extraneous what must I still believe what must I still believe in order to feel this way about it. Now at this point you are willing to be honest with yourself. You will be utilizing your timing to your greatest advantage. You will come up with the belief that you have which because you have it then quote unquote causes you to feel that way. As we have said many many times you can transform any belief you have but not until you own that belief not until you admit to yourself even though it may be a belief you do not prefer that you have it denying that you do have those beliefs puts it out of your grasp to change it admitting that you have it and saying thank you thank you at least now I know I have it gives you the opportunity to change it and it is that simple once again you have nailed down that limiting belief and admitted to yourself that you have it owned it you can change it and the simplicity in changing it is simply to word in your mind or out loud if you wish your new preferred belief. Then you have admitted the old belief perhaps you have allowed yourself to see how the old belief now that you admit that you have it allows you to feel. When you formulate the new belief use your imagination for a moment and allow yourself to see how you would truly feel if you really had the new belief muster up that feeling. First you must see the new belief then you must feel it once you do the simple simple process which is no process at all that enables you to now have the new belief is now that you stated it seen it now that you felt it activated shall we say emotionally how that feeling would feel then you simply need again through the auspices of your imagination determine how if you saw that felt that truly you would act and then act that way see it feel it be it it is that simple you may make it as complicated as you wish if you need a process but it is also that simple that is how you are already creating your reality when you have a belief you act as though you have it if you have emotions that you quote unquote do not prefer emotions don't just happen well I just feel that way now an emotion is always a response to a belief so therefore you can use what you label your negative emotions to be able to define the belief that you still have that you do not prefer and change them already you do this automatically if you have a feeling that you do not prefer it is from a belief if you have that belief you act like you have it that belief system any belief system brings along with it a self-sustaining self-regulating system of logic system of evidence and it seems when you buy into any belief most shall we say firmly that that's the way it is that if not necessarily the way it is when you change to the new belief and use the same protocol consciously now acting as though you are a person with the new belief that will then generate it self-sustaining self-prepetuating system of logic and evidence and soon enough that will seem to be that's the way it is and it will be for you change can be rendered down to that simple notion and saying thank you thank you is your willingness to use your creation to express your appreciation to yourself for allowing that issue to come up so you can transform it you never get rid of the least you are all being the creators of your own reality the entire universe there is no outside therefore where can you get rid of anything to know where if you could even using old imagination imagine a boundary to your being and you are to take the thing you say you wish to get rid of and push it as far away as you possibly could it will still come up colloquially speaking to that boundary and the harder you push shall we say it's a bit like a rubber band the harder it will come flinging back into your face most literally and then perhaps you will give yourself the opportunity to use it integrated and transform it but you cannot get rid of anything it is a matter of using it when you use all your creations the seeming momentums from the older unpreferred ones do transform do integrate do play themselves out it is not that you continue for the rest of your life to relabel things you don't prefer which seems like you are being most blind to your surroundings now you allow the unpreferred creations to play themselves out and then only create according to preference by acting upon in any given moment what truly moves you with integrity what truly excites you that is your compass that is your compass needle pointing to the magnetic north of your purpose in life so therefore use what you have created if you like it keep it if you don't you can't get rid of it you can transform your willingness to express gratitude rather than frustration gratitude rather than denial gratitude rather than torn with a little is the beginning to taking back your power when you give your power away you are still creating that everything is your creation even if an individual chooses to believe that they do not create their own reality they are creating that and therefore if you trace it back shall we say to the primary notion they are still creating it you are perfect creators as we have said even when you create misery it is perfect missus however when you begin to function validating what moves you you begin to say to the universe that you are now willing to be who it is you chose to be the universe has always supported you when you are being who you wished you weren't it only goes to say that it will continue to support you when you are being who you wish you are and in fact that support will seem to be more full more complete for rather than supporting your right to create limitations the universe will support your choice to free yourself up from the very limitations you say you do not desire so allow me now to thank you thank you for your willingness to begin to view these ideas for your willingness to take your creatorhood from the realm of unconsciousness and make it conscious this is what gives you the ability to generate your reality according to preparets when you say to the universe that you most strongly believe that much of what you will experience will be non preferential it supports you it provides realities that seem non preferential now be a bit more creative decide consciously command that you can create according to preparets when you truly believe that way therefore feel that way therefore act that way the universe will support that and again it has supported the non preferential reality what evidence within that is there to say that it will not support the preferential one it will therefore at this timing allow me to express again my and our unconditional love and thank you and ask you now how may I be of service to you sharing I think you have created some really perfect confusion here all right co-fusion very good fusing many portions of your being together and looking at them from the new you that you are right now do go on I'm done with basically what you said I've seen it I've felt it I've been there I've imagined it have you acted it have you been it well I've acted it to a point when I open my eyes and I say okay the acting means I'm gonna go in the end and say order stuff from my store and then I open and I will check book and money's not in there to do that I wonder well how far can I go on well the idea again is to do what excites you from what's available not from what's not the idea is there is always something available if in any given moment you will truly look at what's there not what you demand must be there at that particular time would you like a no risk formula for proceeding in this way that allow me now to share with you what you may loosely call the tool of the five for this will be helpful for individuals in your society who are involved in what you label projects this begins again with five notions number one vision in this sense we feel you have that the vision of what it is you truly prefer and what it is that excites you the most number two however is timing the idea is when you have the vision of what excites you you begin to trust in the timing again nothing is extremely not even the timing and when you begin to flow with the timing allow the timing rather than making it conform to what you insist it must be you can never force any reality to change you force reality to remain the same changes the constant therefore you can simply allow that change and that means whatever is occurring in that particular timing is in that moment what you need to look at and if you do look at it it will benefit you most fully so in a sense be here now and do not project how things must be in any given moment use the advantage in any given moment vision timing knowledge allow yourself to attract whatever knowledge you would need in order to proceed with the exciting thing now this does not mean that you must struggle and strive and be miserable and bury your head in some book now that is simply one of the beliefs about acquiring knowledge on your planet allow it to happen through synchronicity allow it to happen through co-incidence allow yourself again using what's right in front of you and when you see an opportunity in any way shape or form to gain some knowledge that will enable you to proceed take it and opportunity is only as good as your willingness to act upon it vision timing knowledge resources resources can be again your willingness to allow others to do particular things that do not excite you and you will when again being cognizant of the mechanism that we are outlining for you attract such individuals you are attracting them right now if again you will act on the opportunity when they come along all these steps require acting upon them so therefore again resources will in that sense be attracted to you when you are clear in your vision trust your timing take the opportunity to acquire your knowledge and lastly are you listening oh yeah put assistance now this does not have to mean struggle strife no it can you know that it does not have to but your willingness to validate that what excites you is the only thing for you and you will not settle for anything less than who it is you chose to be is an effortless type in that way of persistence conviction it is the demonstration of your conviction in what you say is your vision and what you say you truly believe so again as a recap vision timing knowledge resources persistence notice if you follow these five things I guarantee you 100 percent not 95 100 percent you will create the reality you prefer therefore in your particular situation allow yourself to quote unquote nail down which aspect within those five ideas is your colloquially speaking weak point the idea is what we are saying we'll sink in on many levels allow it to also allow us at this point to provide what you may label loosely a tool of realignment we sometimes refer to this as the tool of the seven this in a sense is the tool you use well all right I mean this quite colloquially but when you need to be tossed a lifesaver when you in your reality sense in some way shape or form you are going down for the third time listen very carefully again the tool is of realignment which happens very conveniently to start with the letter of first of all relax sit down relax close your eyes second release take a deep breath all the way down to the bottom of your being and when you let it out release your tension release your anger and fear relax release when you have done so reflect what must you believe in that given situation in order to be creating a reality you do not prefer reflect upon your definitions much of what we have shared at the beginning of this interaction define what you are believing and be willing to reassign the preferred beliefs and act that way relax release reflect remember remember what your vision is remember what it is that excites you re-center yourself to what excites you in the remembers that you are always in that sense loosely speaking a member so remember yourself do not dismember yourself relax relax release reflect remember respond allow yourself to move with conviction as we have already shared allow yourself to light a fire beneath your feet and get shaky move and what this will enable you to do is real eyes your preferred reality therefore so far we have relax release reflect remember respond realize and then when you have done so there's only one thing left to do rejoice for you have reconnected with the center of your beingness you have realigned yourself according to preference if you truly believe in what excites you you will not accept any evidence that what excites you does not work and if you do believe that what excites you does not work look at that belief you cannot change it till you own it and if that is your truest belief we suggest you look to transform it will always limit you in that way now again much has been transmitted from us to you in what we have just shared very much on many levels that may also not be perceptible as you in that way define perceptive so therefore allow it to sink in allow yourself to apply your particular situation to the specifics we have mentioned and you will find if you are willing to be honest if you are willing again to reflect upon it where in that framework you are not allowing yourself to create what you prefer it is all there okay i have one more question in addition to that oh one moment does that make sense it makes wonderful sense all right can be beyond just a wonderful concept however if when you heard it it rang true with you in that moment you were it there need not be a separation between understanding it and really feeling it when you understand it for that moment you do feel it and you do not need to draw the separation do go on um okay i go through this whole process and i do this now i want to know about the immediate demands made upon me right now what am i to do with these demands that i it appears i cannot meet may i ask you a simple question yes will you be honest with the answer yes are you doing in every given moment what excites you there's your answer when you do you will create a momentum behind that that is just as great as what you are perceiving to be again the momentum from your older belief structure what you are speaking to me about is what you perceive to be a momentum from your old beliefs this is one one of the reasons we began the way we did this evening i guess i have to step with all that now thank you or do not have to make it so laborious have some fun it will be but again nail down nail down what you believe even if it's something you don't prefer very often if individuals don't prefer to have a belief when they are exploring becoming enlightened they go into denial and that locks that belief away from your abilities to transform it not owning it denying what you believe this enables you from changing it and to you as well if indeed you will do this you will be a sparkling example of just how accelerated this process is when you do it all right yes thank you and to you as well sharing the show i have uh sharing and then also a few questions for you do share okay um well recently in the last week i got some stuff in the mail and one of the things was remission control the last time we had an interaction we talked about the s-tar command and mission control and uh i had filled out a questionnaire they had accepted back to them and they had sent me a card and i believe not to have psychic or anything but that um i believe it was it's a women's handwriting but i'm not sure and i just said i was asking you about purpose and he said your purposes is designed around your essence usually what you love to do is your purpose and that's just uh m ci abbreviated from mission control all right our simple revision is that it is your purpose not usually always from our perspective do go on uh the other thing is i got another thing in the mail from all i researched and ever heard of before you know that he popular and um evidently uh have done research and astrologically about my birth timing uh which was in 1956 of february to 27 and they said that i am a beyonder and i'm not sure what a beyonder is can you elaborate on that no but i can say that the channel has received a similar letter so apparently you are in the same club however allow us to in that way suggest that you are simply now beyond being willing to settle for anything less than what moves you you are beyond the concept of perpetuating realities you do not prefer out there that's really good one thing is that i did understand from reading what the letter they sent me was that throughout my life and i thought about it quite a bit after reading letter i haven't really always satisfied my own desires in terms of i start projects and never finished my projects all right well understand that is a safe bet for many members of your society nothing derogatory meant simply an observation uh i'm not sure if it has anything during my astrological stuff which is Pisces from our perspective if you buy into it you can create that effect but it need not have a controlling effect on you simply be a description of particular crystal and patterns of energy that are representative of what will allow you to do the things that excite you pick colloquially speaking the precise moment the precise slice of crystalline reality to incarnate into this life that will enable you to do exactly what it is you prefer to do so in that way you can simply look at it as a blueprint of what will enable you to do what it is you wish rather than a controlling factor but either sense that you buy into will be what you experience and what we are mentioning is no less true that makes sense i have always questions tonight for some reason um that's all one of the other questions i had was when you go to sleep or or just even when you're awake um i believe that you can actually talk to yourself that really taught yourself how loud if you want to have conversations with yourself in your mind that you're able to do it like if you want to sing a song without singing it you can create a song oh yeah and uh and by the way shall we say one of the mediums through which you do so is your imagination but go on and so i find quite interesting so many just just that you can take it a step further that screen that blank screen of your imagination is quite remarkable simply think of any individual and you will get an impression of their actual face your imagination is quite sensorial though they are shall we say inner senses rather than your usual outer ones but the impressions you receive from it can be quite rich because your imagination is a form of reality you can relegate it to simply fantasy or you can understand that anything that you can imagine on some level exists you cannot imagine non-existence go ahead and try my final question it was that i had this sense that over the years that i feel that in sleeping state that uh it might have forever been extraterrestrials around the house you know working around the house in sleeping state when i'm not aware physically within your waking dream no within your sleeping dream and listen to the word reality yes that is more shall we say of a common meeting ground area where you will shall we say loosen up your belief systems and accept that type of visitation in this particular instance that is our sense thank you very much and to you share your question from someone who couldn't be here tonight oh right um they want to know about time uh this was the question all time being simultaneous everything has already happened that will happen it's all happening at once why then can't we step out of the time that's non-preparential directly into a time that is preferential well you can what do you think we have been discussed in between period is simply your judgment according to the old belief but if you are willing to immediately adopt the new belief there is no in between period when you relabel those things you don't prefer they don't have the same effect in the very moments that you are willing to relabel them so if you are sensing a shall we say miserable transition you are still functioning much from the over non-preferred belief system and that is your indication say thank you thank you he's important that though he is the the description he uses is that he wants to create his reality that he used for you as being blue with six arms how can he step from this time frame of being given with two arms and legs to be blue with six arms how did he become that first of all we proceed in the example you have illustrative provided is that he does not truly prefer to be such a being anywhere but the idea is that you have chosen this reality with certain parameters now as you begin to expand those parameters will begin to transform however while you are in it you have done so for a reason and if you will begin to not deny that you may begin to give yourself the opportunity to see the reason if you wish to be blue with six arms shall we say you are not focusing on what you have chosen and are using being blue with six arms as an escape there is a distinction i'm sure he will appreciate that thank you all right be sure one more however in any moment within his imagination he can be blue with six arms if he will validate that reality it may seem even a bit more real again though we do not perceive that as an ultimate goal and we thank you yes sure i've been married for 43 years congratulations and my husband i have a different his night and day oh um he has retired and he is um very negative more so than any other time and i have been occasionally trying to express some of what i've learned oh and i get a stone wall now are you expressing it in a way i listen very careful in which on some level he may perceive you are saying what i am saying is better than what you are doing therefore you should change even a nuance of that is that in there is your resistance be a living example of which you speak without the need to convince at all he will ask you my goodness your life has transformed what are you doing i want in so it doesn't take any words then the idea is it will always take being in your reality a living example is the shall we say the greatest opportunity that you can offer someone to view a new belief system again though getting all right down in the dirt with them and arguing is truly reinforcing the very negativity you say you have transformed yes another um i have been teaching a course called you are what you think for many years and i i start doing that to get my own business and i know that you teach what you need to learn yourself innocent sometimes it may simply be a sharing can you repeat what you were teaching i'm a teaching of course that i have labeled you are what you think oh the college the college i work for labels that you know are computed the kingdom and life then you realize if you think what you teach is what you need to learn that's true for you you are but i think doing that in order to go in my own business which is slightly different but it is helping other people but i didn't know whether i should be pursuing this move as it's an i should be sticking to learning more of what we're doing today well again does it excite you both of them are connecting all which one excites you more i think teaching when i was teaching all when will you do probably this year it is that simple then probably you will get a reality you prefer do i have one in order to do the other not necessarily no and why do you have this definition that one is mutually exclusive of the other that's true perhaps they can enhance each other be synergistic in other words the whole is more than the sum total of the parts all your excitement all your excitement although there may seem to be many different exciting things are really all one thing they are the expression of who it is you most truly chose to be in this life so therefore what you are labeling as separate ideas may simply be very literally different facets of the same crystal yes my last one oh um this is probably been asked before by other people not in exactly this way i do not remember dreams and i don't know whether it's because i don't need any more messages or whether i just work on remembering the messages that are there that i'm not hearing the idea can be many fold one idea is when you are quote unquote within the dream reality you are always experiencing some type of consciousness much of that exploration is exploring aspects of your non-physical existence when you quote unquote for his all a literal illusion but come back or wake up into this dream you will only bring back something as a memory that you have a framework to bring back non-physical experiences in general do not have the framework to bring back as a memory but there is one other idea as you begin to live this dream you will no longer have the need to have a separation between that dream in which you enable yourself to do many things and have a malleable reality and this dream which is rigid and solid and unchanging the idea is when you begin to live this dream there is no longer the need to create separate dream experiences so it is a combination in that way of both simply trust that when you do have a dream memory that is when it is significant for you to look at when it is not it is significant for you to be right where you are at any given moment with your full attention upon that moment and not remembering a dream does that make sense oh thank you very much shit and to you Amos fond and loving good day last class has been going on how about at the beginning i've been having exploring a lot of things the past couple weeks lots of friction yes lots of friction right into third destiny urgency situation oh may i make a suggestion before you go on yes thank you thank you i like the understanding that they don't have a little thing written by my phone every situation it's every situation in life is a learning lesson between the more power and life oh thank you yes sometimes with me every day and again as you said we thank you every opportunity sometimes I forget the fact oh you know but what I've been realizing especially now each of them in the past five hours I spoke with an ambulance afternoon that's really not quite an interchange and going back and forth looking at this reality that reality which reality is correct rose or not correct in person i came up with it both it you know is this right is this right and it was really deep to say it's not this or that again it's this and that and that's just all of a sudden starting to unfold that everything that i've been exploring the confusion started to blow off like in the past two hours because it is this and that and everything that comes along with the synchronicity of it is then dynamic forming because I went into a confusion I went to a lot of friction and then I came through it and and now I feel like the door is starting to open and really you walk through them yo yes willingly you know oh and also from that I just wanted to ask you about what do you think about going to Massachusetts have a good time no man i'd like to bring you up to Massachusetts you'd like to come up and visit too as arrangements are made we will be there and I love you as will you as well one moment before we shall we say cease this particular interaction one of the greatest services that you can be to another individual is to allow another individual to be of service to you you can do this consciously then you may find less of a quote unquote need create situation in which you will finally allow other individuals to be of service to you allow them to be of service first is this ringing anyway yeah thank you very much next shift shape for sure it this is the first time I've been to react to in a group like this to uh solve heal yourself or what what it may all right this is my first time as well and and that's simply that we view all occurrences as the first time that makes it fresh that makes it exciting we do not get bored go on you are reflecting upon ourselves it is reality imagination I just like to answer ask you one question oh what is reality reality is what you most truly believe it to be that is your reality there is no overall contrary to the popular notion on your planet there is no overall that's the way it is there is no overall objective reality it is all subjective reality therefore reality quote unquote reality is whatever it is that you choose unconsciously or consciously to create by way of your belief system does that answer the question no changing my reality I'm building walls not only for my new pride but I'm changing reality for everyone around me and that might not be what their perception of the reality is one moment one moment one moment there are some misunderstandings occurring between us it is not that you would constantly at the flicker of a candle change your entire reality it is that you always have the opportunity to create a reality that you prefer when you are doing so you only attract to yourself aspect of that reality that you are being the vibration of therefore you will always attract yourself exactly who and what you need to continue to be who you are each reality is created from each individual and though they may have differing belief systems there is an overall agreed upon seeming commonality so therefore it is not that when you change your belief your whole world shatters and affects everyone around you it's when you change your belief your experience of your reality changes and those around you will in a sense interact with you from that new portion of their being this so they may seem to have changed in reality you have changed and you are now interacting with the level of their persona that corresponds to that change for they also exist on these levels simultaneously also does this make any sense yes does this answer the question in a way yes simply determine what it is that excites you the most in life with integrity that can be considered your overall purpose in life in each given moment allow yourself the slack to see what choices are in front of you and choose them according to your excitement when you do so that thing will be most effortless to perform needless to say it does not take much effort to do what excites you the universe will support you with whatever abundance you need to continue to be that new and it will lead you to the next most exciting thing those around you will experience their version shall we say of that excitement and you will attract individuals who will support who it is that you are being it is not that you will again shatter their reality and because you are now being who you are you will be most content most happy so therefore the overall effect on them will be having a much happier much more self realized person around them and they will respond accordingly so their changes will be positive seeming to you and you do not infringe upon their reality by your willingness to be a to begin to create consciously is that a yes but if there's some more specific idea that you are seeking to explore no oh if one comes up please share all right thank you and you as well sharing sorry hi um can you talk a little bit about when someone is trying i have two sisters that are trying to perceive and going through all kinds of medical procedures to do this uh Nancy and Mary Ellen um can you seek others specifically for them or in general about when someone is trying to kind of see even can yes first of all understand the process you label birth consists of agreements between souls the souls quote unquote that are to be born are not yet children and therefore you can dialogue with them in your consciousness on an equal level therefore our first suggestion would begin to be to invite and begin dialogue in a positive way with the souls to be born our second advice however would be to relax do not make it such a bone of contention conception is a matter of allowance if you are tight you are not open and receptive if you make and focus on not conceiving that's what you'll get if you relax and allow conception that's what you'll get is that absurd yes i shared both those ideas uh one of my sisters is there anything beside that more particular to i do i think then uh rather than listing the reasons why they do want to conceive list the reasons that they don't and look at them do not deny them thank you very much and we thank you as well sharing sure yes hi and thank you thank you i just have a follow-up well all right um stir it off i want to receive the share a couple weeks ago all right one moment please speak up debo so that all may share in the gift that you want we uh we had a long discussion about what was it exciting as most of you like feeling and we came up with this unbelievable thing about motorcycles i think jess that is rather believable but going anyway we uh were exploring some facets that i found interesting well right do share and how excited well um the one that actually has pinged out to this point is real coincidence uh i want to be at the post-to-fake coincidence i wanted to uh want to instruct two people to do motorcycle union union property well all right a balanced instructor very quickly yes and uh it worked out or the class to do this the last saturday and the instruction for doing it was one section of time this month and there was only like one slot left home and i passed it because i'm going to be in the slot open all i just all ready so as the next saturday is driving my instruction well how excited you know you need to tell me it is that simple okay thank you very much for your willingness to shall we say establish and maintain your sense of balance simply now allow others to revel in that joy and we thank you Sherry fresh jacket um um are you familiar with the spirit that christians refer to as jesus but i believe that that ticket spirit was also voodoo and hot muhan innocence yes we are very familiar with that aspect of shall we say your world spirit that aspect of your mass consciousness in in the particular shifting of consciousness that we are all going through now will there be anything anyone any spirit similar to that that was oh yes however what you label your second coming will not occur in a single individual will occur in each individual that was a symbol to you your jesus of a portion that is within each of you of your direct connection to god or all that is and the second quote unquote coming will be the awakening of that portion of your world spirit within each individual consciousness and as is occurring as we speak one at a time we do so did your dimension in any way have it similar oh yes every civilization every planet if you will has a version of this they will go by varying names but we do as well again it is a portion of your mass consciousness and therefore each planet having a mass consciousness contains that style of portion total unconditional love and acceptance we have it as well and to you as well at this timing we will pause for a short break of 15 to 20 of your minutes and resume contact at that time
