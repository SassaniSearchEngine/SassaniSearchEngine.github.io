 All right, I'll say before we continue, a request was made to lighten things up. Being that you are all inherently beings of light, that should be, as you say, a no problem. As we proceed, do remember, though what we have been discussing is detail, though what we have been discussing is mechanical, or perhaps you can say, very physical in nature. The idea of expansion need not be so complex and so broken down into many complicated components. However, for the purposes of clarity, for the purposes of understanding, this evening was the timing for the dispensation of that information. To whatever degree you need to make use of it, you will. To whatever degree it seemed irrelevant to you, it will become relevant as it needs to. Those of you who have had experiences such as we have described will have what you call more of a comprehensive understanding about them. However, unlike many of the interactions that we have had with you and members of your society, the explanation that I began this interaction with was what you would call preparatory in nature. Therefore, it may seem more relevant, more useful, more pragmatic in days to come. Generally, we do not function this way, but there is a particular timing, a particular threshold that you have reached societally, collectively. It is the timing for the dispensation of that information. I simply ask, if you wish, nobody will force you to trust me on this one. Therefore, as we proceed, we can continue to honor the individual's request for likeness, if you will as well. Therefore, to whatever degree your imagination is engaged, I ask you now how we may continue to mutually be of service to each other, sharing. Hey! Now, that was an example of simultaneous expression. Fennail. Can we change the perspective to your planet? There are many of us here who would like to hear more about your society. Is there something specific that you wish to discuss as we have shared many aspects and details of our society in interactions past? Tell us more about the aversion of parties. What do you do when you get together and how does the conversation happen in you? Do you understand that we are beings of fun and excitement? We, because we are committed to who we are and what we are doing at every moment, drink in life fully, consciously or responsible for our decision to be here as physical individuals and constantly aware of the fact that we have so chosen. Therefore, there is never anywhere for us to go or something for us to do that we are not already doing. Everything that we are doing in every given moment is a complete commitment to that particular event. Therefore, when we, and I will use your terminology because we do not make such a distinction between living and celebrating, when we party, we really party. There is the idea of what you will sometimes refer to as singing or something similar. We do communicate what you call telepathically, though we still do contain what you call the idea, vocal chords. Therefore, singing or our version of harmonious expression can take the form of making sounds, tones, pronouncing ancient words in our language through the vocalization process, but it can also be a harmonization on what you would call again very loosely a mental level. Because what you call thought is also a vibration and we can empathize with each other to the degree that we identify with each other so strongly that we know what each other means literally by creating our own version of what the other individual is intending to communicate. We have created the ability to harmonize thought in a way where we can experience and appreciate the harmonious layering of our, shall I say, thinking process in concert. So what you would refer to as singing or harmonizing can take a vocal form, but we can also have what you would perhaps refer to, I use the term very loosely, a thought concert. There will not be so much the idea of performers over here, audience over there, more like a spontaneous gathering of many individuals and what you call the juxtapositioning, the transpositioning of different groups of individuals so to speak, chiming in where, as you would say in your language, the spirit hits them. The compositions that we create in such gatherings again are quite spontaneous, though they will seem to take a form that you would consider to be structured. They are not, as you say, notes on the written page, and although could be reproduced precisely perhaps another time, this generally will not be how we approach things. In other words, we do have some what you would call remnant salts that may be saying more than once in the lifetime, but generally speaking, our compositions are one-time events. We do it, we experience it most fully, completely committed to that idea, and then move on because that's already been done, so to speak. So there is not generally the repetition of a particular idea. Now there are exceptions to this. Everything what you would call thought-concert, there is a particular moment where the alignment of thought patterns is such that it brings an experience of joy that resonates throughout the present population. We may choose to recreate that portion of the composition again consciously. In other words, if it feels real good, we might do it again. But in general, not in the same order, or does the idea of the spontaneity, what new way can we express ourselves that brings us joy more than the idea of recreating a particular idea? Therefore, even if we were to create a particular thought chord a second time, it would still be a new experience to us. Is there dancing? It can be similar to what you would refer to as dancing on your planet, though it can also be far different for we are not confined, literally speaking, by what you call the gravimetric field of our planet, gravity. So it adds a dimension to the idea to say the least. Also because we very easily shift our perspective, we can literally and again, to whatever degree or imagination will create a version of this, you may understand it, dance with each other's essences, what you call from a shifted perspective from the body. So bodies can dance with body, thought forms can harmonize, but can also move in juxtaposition in time and space to also be dancing. Dancing false, singing false, so to speak. How was it? What I have been expressing would not be vocal, and there would be great resistance in the channel to cooperate with you. We also do not have what you refer to as stage fright. Why is the stage? Alright. If you wish. So it was vin man, vin man. But Shar told us, I'm a wonderful tape called the legacy about our physical relationship, our connectedness and history, and I keep losing this tape and I can't share it with my friends if you give us a little bit about that. Briefly, the creation of my society, which if you look at it from your linear point of view would exist in the future. That is not precise. We exist in a different dimension altogether, but it would seem to be future. The creation of my society is a result of the admixture of what you call your human genetic structure and the genetic structure of another what you call extraterrestrial society. In that sense, we might be loosely referred to, but we do not look at ourselves this way as a hybrid society. Or very literally, I am as though your child or children talking back to you. Is that what you are asking? Yes. Thank you very much. Oh, and thank you, mate. Good to meet you. Thanks. Great to meet you. Thank you. Getting back to out of body experiences and similar such experiences. Alright. Under one condition. Even light. You've been very light. While in the most expanded sense, I know that I create my own reality and that I always make the decisions. Oh, here comes a big, bad, finite butt. In the musical plan, I have parents, associates and mentors who facilitate, coordinate with me and allow me to access information and organize it in ways that enable me to be more effective. You are very creative and very persistent. Do you proceed? It seems very natural for me and it's a comfortable concept for me that I have non-physical associates. Hold on. Before you proceed. That is something that will occur spontaneous. The point that I make with you is that you do not need any external source and when you are willing without the reliance on a teacher, on a master, other than yourself, on an external structure, on a more expanded level of consciousness, when you will allow yourself to take steps to be similar to a person of that vibration, communications, company of non-physical meanings will become part of your experience. But out of attracting what you have now become, not someone giving you a leg up. What I'm addressing is the mechanics of the spontaneous types of experiences. It occurs to me that I have associates with whom or whom I have empowered to activate certain processes and facilitate certain experiences at certain timings relative to my development to enable me to expand into more expanded realities. Understood and confirmed. From your point of view, are you able to proceed to be in-step with this non-physical plan? If there is a reason for me to lapse a loop? I see. It's my understanding, it's my belief that these people are working behind the scenes and are responsible in triggering or putting into place mechanisms to allow for the spontaneous out of body experiences and have the type of polynomial experience. Alright, and for those present in the interaction, if you have pondered the idea of spirit guide, angel guide, white being guide, it would fall into the category that you are seeing. So we've described the situation that this gentleman experienced where he had 12 people helping him into the experience of the out of body experience. Is that not something? In a sense, in that particular instance, there was more the foundational supposition, in other words, he supposed that he needed the help. I see. Now do understand. Spirit guides, there are. Expanded consciousness communications, there are. Angelic assistance, there can be these things exist, they are options. But as you expand, you reach the point where what the agreement becomes is what you call in one of your languages, laissez-faire. Leave them alone, that is the action. When you reach that threshold, which is where many of you, if not all of you, are at, what allows you to take the next step, what allows you to redefine that system of support and what it means to you, is your willingness to function consciously by yourself and not need the guide. The spirit guide never actually does anything for you, never actually tells you something you don't already know. They simply allow you to trigger within yourself timing. But part of the timing is reaching the threshold where you will remove their external assistance and be willing to function more as an equal, as a companion, rather than teacher, learner, master, student. That is one of the, again, timings and reasons for beginning to explain to you that you will begin to create spontaneous, expanded experiences. One of them would be what you call the out of body experience. But others will be seeming to converse with other entities. Others will be having dreams of being in places that are very familiar to you, which you do not remember being in this life. Others will simply be while you are going about your business in your daily life, finding that you are that much more aware of what is going on right in front of you, that much more committed to what you are doing. That much more willing to say, I have chosen this. This brings me joy. There may be certain things that I have put in place in my life that I am going to change. But no big deal. Now I am in the driver's seat. And part of being in that seat is beginning to act as an equal to all the guide consciousness. It is your move. Well, these are your friends. Or these are my friends. Both are academic. A long but long period. But sometimes the most shall I say assisted thing a friend can do is lay off. Along the line of moving into a more expanded experience, is it not possible to be many places at once as opposed to moving from one aspect of yourself to another, actually be present in many places at once? Absolutely. And that is another, again, experience you will begin to perhaps have, again, it may seem fleeting at first, that all of a sudden you are aware of more than one thing in a given moment. Generally, when you have accustomed yourself to a one at a time finite viewpoint, this may seem confusing. This may not make so much sense at first, for you are acclimated to thinking one thing at a time. Suddenly more than one thing is that your awareness at the same time. Confusion may be the general first response. But the idea is to simply allow whatever expanded experience occurs to happen and realize when it happens, nothing is happening to you. Nothing is wrong. You are not losing your mind. You are beginning to be willing to experience more of yourself. If you are willing to embrace this and relax, certain of these instances will increase and you will learn more about yourself in the space of the moment than you seem to have learned in your whole life. If however you are in fear, if however you contract, you close down the experience immediately and this means that you have as you refer to it a safety valve and will never go farther or faster than you allow yourself. Knowing that you have this control allows you to perhaps choose to experience more of yourself comfortably, safely, securely as you say. There is no outside waiting to get you. There are no external beings to pull you from your body and then hold you there so you can't get back. Another entity, another consciousness from the perspective where there is more than one consciousness cannot truly inhabit your body because your body is in your consciousness, your body is made of your consciousness. It is attuned to your consciousness. What you call physical spirit possession is not something that literally occurs. In that instance a person vibrates generally through fear and helplessness to the vibration of perhaps another entity but the other entity never actually inhabits your body. It is impossible. Therefore, you cannot, when you shift your perspective, truly be trapped out or replaced by anyone else. It is not possible once you understand the mechanism. However, it is entirely possible to show up at a place with a different vibrational frequency in a body appropriate to that locale. Thanks, but it will be your body, another body within you, not someone else's body. And we have the capacity to change or alter our body in any way we choose at that conscious level. You do it from moment to moment to moment. Creating health, creating disease is simply the spontaneous transformation of your body. Because your body exists within your consciousness, it is always a reflection of something that goes on in your consciousness. If you are creating this comfort and pain, there is something within you that should you decide to shift, then only can the body fall into place. You have that experience last week, but I am going to call it more of a remembrance, because it seemed that it was more of an understanding of something that I knew at one time or maybe I knew all along. But I envisioned myself as the creator of an infinite number of experiences all considered and infinite present now, and the illusion of aligning those experiences in a linear fashion so that we would feel that we are experiencing it for the first time. But in actuality, reality is more of a slaughterhouse, liability program effect of not being bound to past, present and future. I am wondering, is that the sort of remembrance or the sort of experience that we are talking about tonight? A sparkly example of one of the many options for how to experience more of yourself. And I thank you for the example. What I am also saying is that this is the threshold timing, and all of you, to some degree, in some way, shape or form, will create such an experience, whether it seems like it is out of the body, whether it seems as I said at the dream, I am simply giving you something you can call it where you can understand that you are experiencing the effect of expanding and congratulations. Is this experience involved in the mass consciousness or are there some who would maintain existence in one dense physicality and perhaps resist the increased vibratory that would allow for a lighter body and ability to experience such an experience? Different individuals will choose to express different degrees of their expansion and awareness. But as a whole, through what you call your media and your awareness of the mass, you will begin to see the emergence of more of this type of effect. It will seem to happen as you say exponentially, all at once. Cecil. Thank you. Greetings. Let's see. I have forgotten what I wanted to say. As Billy Crystal would say, just kidding. Welcome to the moment of just kidding. I've heard other entities and I believe yourself, you know, I indicate that if we have the thought of the idea, if we contain it, then we have the potential or the capability to achieve it. Absolutely. If something moves you, if something excites you, it does so as an indication that you are able to create it. In the last four weeks, I've become highly motivated to achieve teleportation, which to me means I can physically move my body somewhere else on this planet, let's say. That means I've got to be two places. That's okay. I don't mind, but I want to be able to go somewhere right away fast right now and save all the time, the energy, and the expense, and do it frequently. How can I do that? Ah, wish to accumulate a new type of frequent flyer mind. The idea is generally in the way that you will create the experience you will, and I use your own terminology, tend to crawl before you walk, walk before you run. One logical, shall I say, result of beginning to expand your consciousness will be to physically, which shall I say, seemingly dematerialized and rematerialized, the physical points of view as well as the body with it, but generally speaking in a linear way, you will first do so from consciousness. It has to do with the agreement that you made to be physical, to be finite, and it has to do with having chosen to express that agreement through certain protocol. Now also, as I had discussed in terms of having yourself experiencing these shifts in perspective, do do wanting to discover it rather than escaping. In the way that you are presenting to me or wish to teleport, I sense an underlying, shall I say, presence of powerlessness behind the motivation. If I didn't believe it's possible, I wouldn't have asked this. Understood. Okay. Well, how does that indicate powerlessness? But I knew you feel at those that you have created experiences that in order to, in that way, fully be that person, you would need to break the agreement rather than, in that sense, keep with the agreement and still get what you want. I'm results oriented. How do I do it? I really want to achieve that. The best answer that I can give at this moment is simply keep it brief and relevant, because that now is not the time. Has there been in doing what excites you from what's available in the moment, factor that out and choose something else that is available, then in the living of your life that can become available. Though at that point you may wish to not do that because there will be other options. Okay. I will ponder what you've just said. There's one of those trust me on this one. Have there been people on our planet, human beings, if you will, that have accomplished that? Absolutely. But since the math has generally agreed to experience a reality where that is not possible, only once you begin to expand your awareness to allow for more possibilities beyond the math agreement, would you be able to see an individual do so? So if you believed it was not possible and completely expressed it as not being possible, you would not see someone doing it and would not believe it when they told you. Let's see. Do you on theachable position? Being in your vernacular. That's why you have spaceships. That and other reasons, that's why. We still choose the physical convention. Consciously. You do when you're playing hide and seek. I'm only... Perhaps when cheated. Thank you very much. All right, just a joke. You do not cheat. Thank you, my. Hey, we do sometimes spontaneously change the rules. Hey, greetings. And who you... Sometimes we go, uh, I used to smoke cigarettes. Ah! Oh, one. I was very sick one time. I left. It seemed like I left my body. I was looking down at myself. And I saw myself lighting up the cigarette. I said, well, why are you trying to kill yourself? And I went back into the body. Sort of. That sort of seems to me that I did. And that cigarette tasted so terrible I got it out, that I was never smoking at. Yeah. Did that sort of wipe over your face? Not the top of a... Well, in a bag. I feel out of body. But now... I saw a lot of different perspectives. I saw my stuff. Like I never saw myself before. I saw myself killing myself. That was something I... I was not. Look at that. On one level, as you created levels at that time, you did have a strong desire to give yourself the reason to transform what you call that habit. Okay. In that particular instance, you allowed yourself to do so in a creative way. Shifting your perspective. To see yourself as others might see you. That is not exactly the type of spontaneous occurrence that we are mentioning for the reasons that we are mentioning it, but it is similar. You did utilize a shifting of your perspective to enhance your awareness. Sometimes, we had a conversation about astro-projection and sleep. That's right, right? And I wanted to swim with the dog. Now, that's the instructions that you gave. Oh, and first of all, we generally refrain from the terminology astro-projection. For that particular point of view, though valid and certainly experientible, does put a majority of the reality of the reality. Outside of yourself. And still the nose starting out in a body and leaving the body into some other realm. Now, from the perspective of how we are choosing to define your reality fully and empowered, the astro-rel as you label it as you is within you. So, perhaps that was not the terminology we used, although that's how you filed it. So, when I did this, I went almost like into a tunnel. I draw on into another place. And I saw the dolphin swimming, and I saw other swimming, and I was there, other than I couldn't see myself, but I saw everything that was going on. What is the question? That's what we're talking about. In this particular instance, what we had suggested was a methodology through which you could invoke, and anyone could invoke, dolphin consciousness, which is somewhat telepathic in nature. Someone expanded in nature, able to be sentient thinking beings as yourself, to create a common experience with you through what you call what you define the nighttime dream reality. You created a level or degree of that experience because dolphin consciousness is again similar to your own in being sentient thinking self-aware beings and let animalistic as you define that term. And since they also do communicate through what you call telepathy, as we refer to it, you can communicate with them, and they will be more than happy in that sense upon request to literally create a common experience with you and what you refer to as the dream reality, the sleeping dream reality. That is what we were discussing with you. That was the suggestion that we made to you simply as falling asleep, request the interaction, and then through allowance and letting go see what happens. You created a degree of that experience. You can consider that it was a shifted perspective so that it may seem like out of body, or you can simply understand that you created another experience altogether. Does that make sense? Digestive. Oh, are you through? Is it not suggestive? Well, I perceive that you say new consciousness. When we expand our consciousness and we see another perspective, I thought that's what you meant. I saw all the dolphins, and I guess that's not the same. In a sense, we are saying the same thing in slightly different terms. A dream, a sleeping dream, is shifting your perspective and creating a reality around it. So from one way of looking at it, again using your terminology, all sleeping dreams are out of body experience where you seem to bring along another body, and the reality wraps around it. Yes? No. I don't see myself in a dream. I see everything. Do you see yourself right now, or do you see those around you? If you saw yourself, you would be twice removed. When you look for your eyes, unless you look down at your physical body, you do not see yourself, yes? Is it not similar? From that, yes, you look that way, I guess you're... Oh, I would see the body. You see, I'm talking to you with my hands, I see body. Oh, I feel body. Perhaps in that instance, it was more of a consciousness-oriented experience where you did not bring along the same definition of body, though you still experienced the sensation of being. Of being co-oriented or in a body. As the observer. All right? All right. Hey. I'm not quite sure I have to phrase this other than say I've already wanted to thank you for what I received here, even in terms of an answer to this, but I guess part of me still wants to put it out. And that is that I've had some various energetic things happening on the property in my home recent ways, and I'm wondering kind of like cross their holes in highways out into a lake and also some fire and water in the summer. And some other very unbelievably beautiful looking mushrooms that seem like they were from the Neverland, all in the same area in the peninsula on my home where I live. And some people said this is like a landing ground for other entities and other people said that there is a communication with some kind of mechanical energy moving here. And I guess I'm just wondering am I supposed to just be with it? May I ask you a question? Other people aside for the moment, what is your understanding? What do you believe about what all this means? Either the sign as you say of something first of all, all right? What is your perception? What is the meaning that you attached to the purpose of the sign? And is it not an obvious sign? The impression that I can just doubt it, the whole movement, doubt it. Then then, friends aside and doubt aside, what then do you come up? That there's something happening there energetically, something going on. There's communication from somewhere that's coming down. What are you moved to then do about it? What I've been moved to is my husband making believe that I used to open my home at the light center and it happens there in the middle of the car and that seems to be moving with a bit of light in an unbelievable way. So it feels right, but there's always the powder in me that says, are you sure? Oh, doubt is not a lack of trust. It is an infinite trust in the thing you say you do not prefer. Now understanding this, you get to choose where you place your trust. All that aside, do you feel that that is what you wish to do? Do you feel that that would be a worthy thing to do? That it would allow you to be of service to yourself at the same time, service of others. Not factoring out yourself. Right. All right. Then it did not obvious. Yeah. Thank you. What will you do? I'll continue with planation and operation. All right. What if trust in the thing you don't prefer comes up? What if what you call doubts, what I am explaining or actually trust in a negative outcome, come up? Oh, great. Oh, will you allow them to paralyze you or simply to reaffirm what you know to be true for yourself? It feels like I use it as an opportunity to surrender and let go of that part of me. Oh, understand the following. You do not need external validation right now. What you need in terms of how you create that term is internal validation. Allow me to borrow liberally from your slime. If you build it, they will come. The rest is up to you. Happy trends. Thank you as well. Thanks, male. Hi. I was wondering, is there a photon belt that's being directed towards her? That we'll consider shortly that we'll have the effect of when it hits that it will give us back our regional 13 chapters? First of all, nothing need give you back something you have never lost. Your willingness to acknowledge what you already have is all it takes to re-energize and create a relationship to what you already are. Second of all, precisely speaking, to address this from another angle since this has come up before, photon is simply white. There are constantly photons, belts, waves of photons bombarding and bathing your planets, both from what you call your central star or sun, and from reflective bodies in the space, and from various forms of consciousness. You are constantly bathed in light. You are actually made of light, and you exist within the light of your own consciousness. You do not need any particular wave or belt to transform yourself. Simply the decision to do so. Individuals will create by agreement certain dates, thresholds, and phenomenon through which they by agreement will decide to express more of who they are at a given time. But that is truly the mechanism and not anything external catalyzing who you are. Does that make sense? Oh, yes. There have been many such belts of light. There will be many more. You can use one of them as a tool to catch the wave of one of them and express more of who you are and say it was the photon belt. Many individuals will do this, and many other individuals will say, well, who cares as long as they do it? What I am proposing to you is you need not wait until that date. If you understand yourself to have 13 centers that you wish to express and be in contact with, close your eyes and feel them. Do not think that they have been taken from you and need to be given back. You cannot lose who you are and simply need but access it through conscious awareness, through intention. Does that make sense? Yes. Do you still wish to wait for the day? No, but I was wondering if that is actually something that is occurring. From my perspective, again, there are various waves or belts of photons that vary in intensity. Several have occurred recently according to timing, several will continue to occur. So you can experience the effect of what you are saying. Yes. But any changes that occur, I simply remind you you are creating. And simply using that as an opportunity to do so. This source stated that this would change the total electrical system on earth. The batteries would not be able to be used. We would just change our electrical source. What did the proposed date of this activity? Well, they said within the next two years. One more. From my particular scanning abilities, what you are saying in terms of the interference of your electrical system on an ongoing basis would be an accurate. As a side note, it is my perception that your planet will experience in the next few years what you call increased seismic activity. And such phenomenon such as that can result in the acceleration of that phenomenon. And therefore, the phenomenon of seismic activity on what you sometimes refer to as earthquake. Those can result in certain how we are out at you. But it would not necessarily be a pervasive energy field that interferes with the overall flow of current on your planet, at least from my ability to scan. And so that they also had stated that this belt went through the fact of the creator of blessings on a gracian creator, would take us and spin us up to a closer, send us closer to the serum translation. So that was just the other part of it. In the way that you mean, there can be that effect, but it would not be as abrupt as you might imagine. It would be imperceptible. Thank you. Thanks. Two questions. All right. People talk a lot about protecting yourself with white light when you go into meditation or when you do. I guess it's shift in perspective. Only from the perspective that they can be attacked. In other words, the setting up of a protection is a double edged sword, as you say, for it already comes from the perspective that an attack may be imminent. So it's like the reason I'm not getting a security alarm is because I don't want to come from the frame of mind that someone's going to attack my house. So I'm not doing that. Well, even if you're saying that that's not something that's necessary, obviously, unless you believe it is. You are made of white light. Right. So in that sense, why would you need to invoke what you are if you're already that? Once you understand that and no longer make the separation. Individuals who begin by thinking, I am in a body. I am a separate being. I exist within a reality. In their exploration to expand their definition of their self, become aware of the idea of light, the pervasive light of creation. They generally first do so thinking that light to be separate from who they are. Invoking that light from that point of view is still an expansion from believing that they are completely isolated to now, at least having some relationship with that light. Therefore, it has a value at that stage of awareness, of understanding. As you begin to let separate yourself and understand, all that is or God is not over here and I am over here and I must connect because we are separate. That whole system takes on less meaning. If God is all that is, you cannot be the one exception. Therefore, you are that energy. You do not reconnect because you are never separate. You can real eyes make real in your experience acknowledge that you always were part and parcel of that energy. Once you have done so, there is nothing to protect yourself from, for there is no outside. Negative influence can only occur if you do not know who you are and have not decided who you are. All options will make themselves present to allow you to choose. Once you have made the commitment to yourself and that commitment is love, light, positivity, expressing yourself as a creator, negative influence is simply an option that becomes meaning. That becomes one of the infinite number of possibilities that has nothing to do with you. Two more questions. Thank you. Two more. You just want to have healing. In other words, when you visualize a healing, you think about surrounding it with gold and light or bringing in a gold and light or so I heard or Vinny does that. So that is one way utilizing color of the white light which contains all frequencies to enact or shall I say focus upon a particular frequency of energy through which many individuals associate the idea of healing and allow themselves to heal. From one way of looking at it, it is the invoking of a frequency in order for the person to identify with that frequency more strongly, but ultimately they create the healing. So with my awareness with such that I realized I was vibrating in that frequency anyway, I put healing instantaneously. Absolutely. But individuals will always access tools that are around their level of willingness to acknowledge who they are. So if that tool will be helpful for you because you still believe yourself to be somewhat isolated, it can be very helpful. Ultimately, as you expand into yourself, you will look at that as a separation. But when you start from an isolated point of view, it is an expansion. So it depends which side of the coin, as you say, you are viewing it from. But it is helpful and for many people, it is an expansion. I am this much more than I used to be, including this light, including the ability to synchronize to these frequencies and so forth. Okay. Thank you. And now I get to a question that's really out of character for me. Someone else asked and I'm curious. Oh, interesting. This is about number four. Oh, why? Great. Can you tell me what was being shot out of the atmosphere by the United States over what would be New Zealand, way out from the atmosphere, September 14th, 16th of 1991, if anything. You'll govern. You can't tell us what was... Oh, I absolutely can. It was asked, you'll govern. Any specific person, I should... How to you? Good night. Good night. Good night. Who now? I have a nine-year-old boy who has a relationship. He suffers from horrible nightmares. Oh, suffering. It's from hype. It's all right. It's not like enough evidence. But I'd like to know what to do to him to help him in some light. His body gets very rigid, he trembles, and he looks... Can you give one overall example of such an experience of what he dreams? But he tells you about him. And he doesn't see me, and now the guys are wide open. Oh. And he had one last night, his body was trembling, he was rigid, and when he exposed, he could do his feet. It wasn't that he was not speaking with a known voice. Oh. And he had no recollection at all. So I'm just wondering what my... Does he ever have such a recollection? My suggestion is to simply suggest to him that he can choose, if he so desires, to request that he remember them. And then when he does create a memory or an version of the experience to be able to relate it to you, deal with the specifics in the circumstance. He lays between his sleep. But I am saying now to bring it to the conscious level. From the conscious level you can dialogue with it. From the level of the creation of it now, it becomes more difficult. So plant the idea within him that he has the choice to remember them if he so requests it, and when he does have him share that with you, and dialogue again about the specifics, which will make more sense if you should choose to do this. Is this something that I'm creating? Is this is in my reality? Am I creating? You're creating the awareness of the phenomenon, the opportunity to ask the question about it, and your version of my answer. But he is creating his experience of it. Understood? Well, I'm thinking that at this point he doesn't really have the experience of it, if he doesn't remember it at all. He just seems to have more experience than it is. I see what you're saying, and what I am telling you still remain the same. For in having him desire to remember an experience and describe it to you, your version of what he describes is what's relevant to you in the situation. Does he make that decision before he goes to sleep? Not in what you call conscious passion, but it is part of the synchronicity of his experience. It is not an interruption from his perspective and who he is. I assume this individual is conveying that it is interrupting or seeming or being interpreted as an interruption for her. I had a similar, someone else came for me with a similar story. The person or stuff would hear voices. And after to just close your eyes and speak to who is calling her. But this boy doesn't hear, it's just you talking to someone else. It was another, someone else was talking. And then she picked up, she was talking for the other person. And I was able to communicate with that other entity. Something like you and the channel. And all I do is ask who was there and they said who was there? In that particular instance, it is my perception. Now, we have not discussed this and I do not know the specifics of the situation, but it is my perception that that individual was, as you say, I will use the binoculars. Communicating with what you call deceased individual. That is different from what I am discussing with this individual. You say another voice is not a voice. The voice that you use is what you say to make in the midst of the nightmare is not in the voice. Again, is what is being said intelligible to. Can you relate? Yes. Last night in a very deep, grovely voice. Oh, how excited. He was very, very much like a teenage. He said, I hate humans. Oh, right. How did you feel about that? And I can guarantee you, it was not me. I can't. It's all about that. Here is my perspective. No, he is not possessed, as I have explained. That is not literally possible. It does not involve external influence. It involves something that he is exploring within himself. Now, this is why I have given this specific recommendation that I have. And really cannot go much farther unless you are willing to, shall I say, participate with my suggestion. All right? Yes. Then it will make more sense. Issues will come up that not only will assist him, but you as well. All right. I thank one moment. No need to fear. If there were such a negative individual, I would be able to at least sense it and do not in this instance. Thank you. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Do animal consciousness honor everything, just as she was looking at consciousness? And do you have animals of other what you would call disease and things like that? We do have what you would call different animals upon our planet. And in that sense, to the first question, animal consciousness is very from what you call human type style self-awareness consciousness. There still is the idea of self-awareness. There still is the idea of being a specific individual consciousness, but it is a different, more contracted, more instinctual form of consciousness. Now that does not mean that they cannot have affections and so forth toward humans and so forth, but that is largely a mirrored effect. So do you communicate with your animals health actively? First time to time. In general, there is more simply an acknowledgement of them, so to speak, going about their business as there is from, as you say, pets, relationship. Well, thank you. There will be but a few more sharing. Male. Thank you. Two question comments of degrees. All right. Let's see. My son, Sam, when we were talking about dreams, he came to me with a very interesting dream, first time ever. He's seven. And in essence, he and I, in the dreams, I walked into the house, I was wearing a specific shirt. I walked into the house and he followed me, and when he got into the house, the room was full of beings with big, brown ties and slanted eyes. Very, some were blinking, some were fixed, and they were all wearing my shirt. Oh, very interesting. I was moved by it. I was moved by it. Where am I? He has seen this before. Wearing your shirt. I don't know. Ah! Now, I am accessing what you call Halloween. No. Interesting. I'm sure there's a lot of... Now, to some degree, there is a representation of communication, but there is also that symbol and its importance to you factoring in here. Okay. I'll share with others. I was basically in the head for Halloween, and myself, of course, all that. Enjoyed it. Okay, that's interesting. And I also took it as I felt very moved by when he told me because I felt like a part of myself with merging and integrating with more of the likes of you and others, and that I was, you know, emerging with that. Well, maybe next Halloween you'll be me. However, I suggest walking around on your knees. It's just a thing. It's okay. And then, lastly, just to comment on what I talked about in the beginning of the session, I understand and I believe that anxiety is basically excitement with the negative outcome, the belief of the negative outcome. Correct. That is one of my two departments. So, with the so-called anxiety that I might be feeling because of my lack of sleep, I'm frustrated by that. And because I can't seem to find it, I felt anxiety in my life. I did come up with the idea that perhaps it might be a fear or any anxiety it might be from not really believing what I'm feeling or not really believing the success that I'm feeling. I'm feeling that upon waking you may lose that, but you need not feel that. Right. So, could you advise a little more on fun? I mean, I'm pretty sure how to do this, but at this point, where I am in my expansion, what's the next step? Trust that you know best who you are, take a deep breath while you're lying in bed and have pleasant dreams. All right, thank you. Chances are simply by discussing this, you will find that particular phenomenon to society. By the way, were you not to feel that you needed to sleep would be no big deal? It is the idea that you do still feel that you require it, honor that. I understand. Stay in harmonious accord with who you are. I felt like I didn't need it. I felt like I was shifting over to some sort of new reality that I didn't need it as much. That's what I was feeling. Well, this will occur literally at some point within typical histograms, but you're perhaps going to be anxiety. Okay. I thank you. Thank you. At this time, allow me to thank you for your willingness to literally begin to expand your horizons. When you create boundaries of who you will accept that you are, of who you understand yourself to be, stepping over those boundaries can seem a little risky, can seem a little uncomfortable until you realize that what you are stepping from is you, and what you are stepping to is more of you. The resistance that you may feel, the heaviness that you may have experienced at the beginning of interaction is because you are crossing a line, and initially upon crossing it, you do so from a limited perspective. Becoming aware of an idea is generally in a linear sense, in a time frame, the first step toward embracing it, embodying it, being it. The resistance that you felt, though natural, will begin to fall away. The resistance that you may have felt is indeed so deeply ingrained within you in your societal approach that it had even affected the channel in the beginning of this interaction because his core beliefs, his way of expressing himself, cannot completely be factored out of the interaction, though there is a putting aside of many of these ideas so that I can communicate. When I reach a line where individuals may hesitate to cross, it will be felt from the channel on out all the way through the room, and do whatever may attract that as a first time concept. It may have felt heavy like it wasn't white, like why is a land speaking like this? He's not having fun tonight. I am having fun, and you too will understand the value in having been willing to step over such a line. As you begin to spontaneously create new experiences, now you will have somewhere to file them. Now you will have some explanation to allow yourself to continue to expand if you should so choose to. I thank you in that sense for indulging me. Did not mean, as you say, to seem to bring you down. However, sometimes, again, when this line from your perspective seems breached, it comes with its territory. Allowing yourself to be present, and hear and experience what you are now ready to hear, whether it is obvious or not that you are ready to hear it, takes courage, takes commitment, takes the willingness to step out into more of yourself. For that courage, for that willingness, I thank you for allowing me to be the conduit from yourself to yourself to understand and know yourself that much more fully. And I thank the channel for his willingness to put up with it as well. I bid you a most fond and loving, good evening, pleasant dreams and happy trails.
