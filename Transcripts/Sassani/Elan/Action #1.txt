 Welcome and greetings this evening of your time. How are you? Oh, thank you. Good answer. Accurate. Allow me to express my undying, as you say, love unconditionally and appreciation to all of you. It is no accident that you are here this evening. In many ways you may understand this to be a reunion of sports. We have, in that sense, enjoyed interacting in this format through this channel for, as you say, several of your years. In that timing, this has allowed us to convey a body of information, that body of information in many ways for your foundational understanding. For your initiation, fundamentally speaking, is now in that sense complete. Now is the time for the application of the material for those who are so inclined. Again, we do not insist in any way, shape or form that you do what we are saying. It is no better than anything else that you are doing, simply different, simply an alternative and simply a option that will allow you, if you so desire, if you so feel that you deserve it, to create the life that you enjoy, that you prefer and allows you in no uncertain terms to completely validate yourself and through that process, validate your reality and by then extension validate all the other individuals that seem to exist or cohabitate within your reality with you. Therefore, this is, as we have shared, part three of a three part series. Again, colloquially speaking, the Life's Camera Action Series for part one, clarifying your vision, shed some light on who it is that you desire to be and therefore who it is you are. And in clarifying that idea you set up a vibration, that vibration then becomes your reality by simply maintaining it as a clear intention and acting that way. Part two, perhaps you can say camera, for it is the mechanism that allows for, perhaps you can say in many ways, the recording of that vibration, that is clear, definition, clear, deserved ability and clear desire. These lay down the fundamental foundation whereby all of the aspects are in place and then all there is necessary or needed in that sense to do to complete the process as a conscious creator is to then with a foundation act upon that foundation. Apply, apply in your reality as an action, these ideas. You are physical beings in this particular expression of your soul. You are infinite creators, perhaps you can say as your innate self, but you are now exploring within that infinity of your consciousness a finite point of view in a physical reality. The ultimate expression of your creatorhood in a physical reality is action. Action moves is the moving mechanism of your reality. The beliefs, the emotions, the thoughts are a foundation, that foundation subtly or blatantly affects your actions and as we have always shared and is your actions that create the reality. A simple reminder, your society has many notions about what you call spirituality and what you generally then refer to as mundane material reality. And many times individuals will strive to express their spiritual side and feel that in order to do so they must deny their physical side. But this to us is a paradox. It is one way to go about focusing on your spirituality, what it is from again our perspective generally at the cost of a portion of your spirituality and here is why. Your actions, your material reality is a spiritual expression, not a separate idea or a subclassification within spirituality. Action materiality is spiritual, is a form of spirituality. Therefore, it is an expression of your soul, of your spirit and you need not deny yourself material existence, deny yourself action to obtain spiritual. Simply grant yourself the inherent spirituality within your actions, within your materiality. Everything in creation is equal and it is not that spirituality is better than materiality. Now, one is an expression of the other and you can express consciously your actions and consciously shall I say manipulate the materials of your reality with a spiritual attitude, not one at the cost of the other. In order to create in this reality, you must perform an action, you must do something. So another analogy that we have used is all well and good to have your head in the clouds to think lofty thoughts, to ponder your spirituality. But it only becomes practical, it only becomes applicable and usable when while your head is in those clouds to keep your feet on the ground. And when we speak about grounding yourself, we simply mean what can you do in any given moment from what is available, not what is not available. No matter what, your actions ultimately create your reality. You can always use your actions to tell and trace back to yourself what you must be thinking, feeling and believing for you always act like you believe something. If you say my belief is that I deserve everything that I can create in positive love and light, then believe me if you wish, you act that way. If you say I do not deserve, you act like a person who does not deserve. Now as I have shared, technically speaking you contain both beliefs. I deserve, I do not deserve, you contain both of those beliefs. You are an expression of all that is, there is no outside. You contain it all. So therefore it is not I have this belief and do not have this other belief. You have both beliefs but you are expressing one belief instead of the other. And that expression takes the form of action. You are either acting using the aforementioned example like a person who deserves or acting like a person who does not. And there is no middle ground, one or the other. If you act like a person who does not deserve, you get the evidence. Those actions have results which are the evidence of that belief. But if you simply allow yourself to see, allow yourself to project how a person who does deserve would act and act that way instead not denying that you have the unpreferred belief but simply choosing the preferred belief, you can transform your life. Your actions create your life in a physical universe. Therefore acting according to preference is one of the bottom lines of which we speak. And if you say well I can't do that, you are taking an action. You are continuing to perform the all unpreferred actions. It is not automatic, it is not something that happens to you. You are choosing to continue the things you do not prefer. You contain all beliefs and what determines the result is which one you express through your actions. Actions are the bottom line. Action in this particular physical universe and there are many other universes in which this is not so much the emphasis. But is the bottom line? It is the primary mover so to speak of your reality. Therefore begin to pay attention to your actions and begin to ask yourself if something non-preferred seems to be coming out of the neutral soup. What am I doing right now? How am I acting? Am I acting according to my preferred belief or am I acting according to my non-preferred belief? I am definitely doing one or the other. So allowing yourself to establish what you are already doing is step one, owning what you are already doing. Then you can choose something else. If you do not own it and if you then create an elaborate explanation of how it is happening to you, it is a habit. Oh, a habit is automatic. I can't help it. It is happening to me. Well yes, a habit seems to be something which occurs automatically without thought. But once you think about it, once you define it as a habit, you are now conscious of it. And from that point forward, it is no longer a habit even if you continue to do it. It is a choice. It is up to you. You are always acting one way or another. Always. So therefore if you are getting non-preferred results in your life, look at your actions. Do not assume that doing the same thing over and over again seemingly will yield you a different result. No. What will yield you a different result is a new action. And what gives you a blueprint for the new action is your preferred belief, emotions and thoughts. Begin to factor them in and begin to act according to preference, act according to unconditional love, act according to your excitement. In every given moment, there are generally in your finite creations just so many things that are available, available. And I do something about this right now. No, that is not available. Can I do something about this right now? Yes, that is one of the options available in the moment. Allow yourself to remain grounded for what is available. If you begin to act and choose from what is available, you will begin to see a very, very extreme change in your life. For that is coming from a belief and assumption that I always have exactly what I need in any given moment, though perhaps now and then I may have to search out for it may not seem that obvious. And you can apply your creativity to again seek and begin to examine more closely what is available. Well, is that available in the moment? No. It is something I wish to do. Is it available? No. Then it is not an option. I cannot act upon that thing. I would still like to do that thing. Therefore, I maintain it as a clear intention. And when it is one of the options, I know that that timing will be perfect and that when I can act upon it, I will. That is all I need to know. That I still intend to do this even though the reality is not presenting it at this time and that when it comes along, I will act upon it. Your reality delivers to you on what perhaps you would call a silver platter, anything that you desire. But it does not drop as a safe upon your head, these things. It provides situations, opportunities that if you act upon, if you continue the flow, if you continue the momentum, then you can have those things. Then you can create the methodology and the mechanism that will attract anything that you desire. It is completely up to you. The moment you let go of your clear intention, you've sold out, so to speak. That is the only time that you could in that sense not achieve your clear intention when you let it go, when you allow the reality to talk you out of it. But your willingness to maintain the clear intention and act on what is available leads you to that clear intention, whether it is obvious or not. Because it also excites you, anything that excites you in the moment has to do with any other thing that excites you, even if reality-wise it seems to have nothing to do with it. They are again akin to stepping stoves. One stone seems to have nothing to do with one on the other end, but you must traverse one at a time in order to get to the other end, which makes it very integral, an integral part. Whatever excites you from what is available in any given moment is the path of least resistance to the overall thing that you intend to do and excites you, whether or not it is apparent. If you sit around spending the time lamenting that it is not available, then your action is lamentation rather than continuing the flow of allowing your reality to flawlessly deliver to you opportunity after opportunity, advantage after advantage, coincidence after coincidence. Coincidence does not mean accidental. It means the many interwoven series of events that seem completely unrelated, but that are happening at the same time. Coincidence, same time. You are all on the threshold of the greatest transformation that you have individually and collectively ever witnessed upon the soul's life on this planet. The timing is key. The timing is essential. The timing of our, perhaps you may refer to it as a pullback, is essential. Now is the time to do. Now is the time to move. When you allow yourself to do so, you will shine. You will brilliantly shine as a beacon. You will attract around you a nucleus of new individuals. And this will be the beginning of, shall I say, fourth density mankind, but not by talking about it. The time for talking is over, or at least the time for only talking is over. The time for words is over. The time for action is nigh. And the essentialness of the timing will become apparent to you as you watch the face of your world begin to alter. Do not allow anything that you see to provide an excuse to create a negative transformation. Things may seem to be shaking up in a negative way. But I have shared also with you many times that as you expand your awareness of positivity and negativity increases. So your experience of negativity, should you decide to follow your excitement, will be nilled. But your awareness of it for now will be pervasive. Whatever you allow yourself to use as evidence will be up to you. But I simply say that no matter what, no matter what is on your news, is on your media, is in your world scenario, a positive transformation is in full swing. Certain individuals will choose to express a portion of that transformation in negative terms. I need not tell you this, it is evident upon your planet. But your experience of it and your creation of an alternative bubble reality is one of the factors that will allow what you perceive to be your whole planet to transform in a positive way. Understand now more than ever in these interactions that you, each and every one of you make a difference. Every one of you. The whole is profoundly, profoundly affected by each and every one of you. And when you say, well, what can I possibly do about that? You then perform an action of a person who could not possibly do anything about it. And so then the results of those actions show you the evidence. See, I couldn't have helped it anyway. But this is natural. All beliefs have self sustaining, self-provestuating systems of logic, systems of evidence. So when you decide, I also contain the belief that I can do something about it. And I see if I am expressing that belief, I would act this way and allow your imagination to provide how a person would act in that regard. Choosing the preferred actions changes the entire reality, performing the same actions or similar seeming actions yield similar seeming results. The one time you enter a seemingly similar situation and do something different, you understand in no uncertain terms through the result that it is a completely different situation. And that the only thing that kept it seeming the same was your continual similar treatment of it. Now is the time for action. Now is the time for the application. You will be acting according to some belief. You always have. You are right now as we speak, so to speak. And we'll continue to. What I am sharing, what I am suggesting is that you begin to be conscious about what you are doing. Nothing is automatic. The moment you are conscious of anything, it is no longer something lingering in a subconscious. It is something conscious which you now choose to do something about. Choosing to do nothing about it is one action and yields one result. But choosing to not settle for anything less and beginning, beginning to act on your excitement with integrity allows you to express your life in the most effortless way possible with the most fruitful results representative of who you choose to be. Establishing your vision, establishing your excitement is only part of a process of recognition. Where that process grounds, where that process connects to your life, to your reality, to your daily life is what you and through what you do with all this. So I once again asked you to be cognizant of what you are doing. And if there is something that you are doing that you do not prefer, remember you can do something else. One of the strongest tools that we have shared with you is an imagination template of the preferred you. The preferential, preferential you is the perhaps you can say name that we have assigned. This is the you that is already the way that you prefer in your imagination. The reason for that tool is to provide a set of actions. To say all right, I am about to enter a situation before I do anything, allow me to see how the preferred me would act in perhaps you can say the hypothetical situation in my imagination. Allow the preferred you in your imagination to provide an alternate set of actions it always will. If you access it, it always will. Therefore of the tools that we have shared, one of the most potent is the preferential, preferential you. For it always in any given moment with not needing to consult one other individual has what the preferred you would do would act like the actions that the preferred you would take in any given moment. That is a tool of self empowerment. That is a tool you do not need me or anyone else to use. It is yours, it is permanent. Therefore call forth the referential preferential you call forth the excitement from within your heart and act upon that excitement with the recognition that everything is one integrated reality. That everything is an extension of you, not apart from you and therefore deserves the respect that you demand. That is an expression of integrity. Act upon your excitement with integrity. If you were to now forget everything that we have ever shared, simply from this point forward were you to allow yourself to see what is available in any given moment, choose with your excitement and act upon that option with integrity. All that we have shared and you have just forgotten will simply become obvious and evident. It is all an expression of following the message that your higher self always broadcasts to your physical self, your excitement. That is who you are and acting upon it with integrity will allow everything else to be obvious. All questions to be answered. As you are now willing to apply the information should you find and many of you will collectively find certain questions will come up. That is the level that we are now willing to function upon with you whereby we can now extend the next level of support but only according to your willingness to act. Therefore in a sense I am issuing you a healthy challenge to rise and act according to preference. Most or all of your questions will be answered. The ones that do come up are now what we are willing to discuss. You will find a fascination that perhaps you have not imagined in this process. Allow me to once again and for the first time thank you all and again express my unconditional love and appreciation for your willingness to function through your inquisitive nature, through your willingness to accept other realities. Though I do not insist that you believe that I am who I say I am I do understand that many of you do and only simply because you feel that that is correct for you. For as I have said I cannot now and would not even if I were able physically prove my existence to you at this timing because of the timing but applying what we have been sharing will be your proof. It works 100% that is the guarantee that I can give you. If you do it if you act according to your excitement with integrity you will create a life of ecstasy. You will create a seeming momentum and ecstatic explosion of coincidence and recognition of the synchronicity of all things that I guarantee you as you are being that you you are then literally changing the vibration of who you are as a spirit as a soul as an expression in your physical world and this is the vibratory level that we physically exist upon. So this opens up the possibility of physical face to face interactions. I have always shared that we do not insist that this occur but there is a degree of likelihood behind it occurring and simply what will accelerate it now is again not talking but doing. Walking as you say your talk that will raise literally your vibration expand literally your consciousness and allow us to perceive each other in a more physical way. That is all there is to it and again I do not dangle this as a carrot or even a goal simply share the joy in the becoming of more of who you are and share the joy in you and we always have only considered you equal to us beginning to treat yourself with that same respect. I thank you for this willingness and I thank you for your willingness to open up the doors within you and begin to peer behind them understanding that there is nothing that you can create that will overcome you and the timing of your creations is perfect even if you had never done what your creation is now presenting to you the fact that it is presenting it to you and in the timing that it is presenting it to you is your indication that you can handle it simply your willingness to interpret this way and then perform the corresponding actions will give you the result the manifestation of what I am saying not simply theory. In exchange for your willingness to co-create these interactions with me and my respective civilization members I thank you and ask you how we may mutually be of service to each other. Sure. Yes. Greetings. And who you good day. Wow. It was quite an introduction. I am walking my talk and I am changing my reality. Well perhaps now more accurately you are sitting your talk but we understand that. That's how it's been that's what was in reference to and I feel I've been feeling so much love and so much connection with just who I am. By the way a convenient parameter built into your reality when you are not walking your talk your reality will let you know about it and that need not be considered anything but an opportunity to transform as a loving nudge from your higher self. Because I look at the people that I've been attracting to my life and they're coming to me and I don't need to talk. I don't need to express myself in words it seems to be embodied in me and it seems to be based me interested in that. Now we are not saying by the way to be completely mute we understand that your major form of communication in your society is verbal communication but we are now speaking of being a living example and then perhaps elucidating what you are doing. That carries as you will find immediately far more weight for it is not a nice sounding theory it is your life. Look they're doing it. I want to know how to do that. That will attract tenful one hundred fall more attention than you have been getting simply discussing it. Well people are listening and people in my reality in my life are open to this idea and that's the beauty that I feel and that's I think what I want I think that's what really excites me because I've been working and taking the action to live what I think I want to do as far as a career and I've been living it to that and I'm finding out that my excitement is an incredible you know there's an abundance of different excitements in my life and one of them is to truly love myself unconditionally and to go right to get that I do and to get that through my children to get that through my friends and through other people. As you act as though you love yourself that will speak far louder than getting through to them that will be an example. It will be a powerful example and it will be more effective again than conversing about it. So simply act like you love yourself and if you are doing something that seems to be expressing the belief that I am not loving myself in this moment so what? You've noticed it, you're defining it, you're acknowledging it and now you're calling for the reperential, preferential you for an alternate set of actions. Do you perceive that I'm not doing that? Perhaps were I to accurately give my particular perspective on and off? I think that's accurate. But the idea is that you need not be right yourself because of that. Rise to the level that you are already creating your reality according to preference and simply continue to expand doing so not harp on where you are no longer or where you have not done so and then judging yourself. The moment you are judging yourself you are performing an action but it is an action that represents it of the fact that you are not unconditionally loving yourself in that moment. Fine, realize that. Perhaps watch yourself for a moment do that and perhaps you will then feel that it is no longer representative of who you are. Judgment is the action of self-invalidation so therefore when you find yourself judging understand which belief you are expressing and remind yourself what you prefer to express. That will be a decision. I don't feel myself, I've learned how not to judge myself and I'm wondering what it is you're saying because it's... I am referring to where you still do. I am not in any way passing judgment upon that judgment simply pointing out that that is an example of when I had said on and off the off. And not necessarily utilizing you as an example but what I am saying applies to all that is present. Because I believe that you know what I'm talking about and you know what pretty much goes on with me according to my communication with my higher self and with you and with the whole idea. Now do understand and allow me to be very clear about this. We are physical beings. We have lives. We have activities. We have things we like to do. I would say we have hobbies but perhaps you will understand our life is a hobby. The idea is that I am consistently engaged in my reality. I do not sit in front of what you would perhaps refer to as television screen watching the actions of individuals upon your father. When a communication is had it is a complete communication. What I need to know I will know and often this will seem to you as though I know intimate details. But it is not that I am overseeing or watching. It is simply that when and if I need to know something I know it. It allows the facilitation of the communication in a clear and intimate passion and you all possess the exact same ability. The only difference between you and I at this point is that I completely trust it and act as though I trust it. As you entertain this notion and act as though you trust it you will find what I am saying. You always have in any given moment what you need if you just look at what is right in front of you and you always know in any given moment everything you need to know. Act that way and you will get that result. Thank you for saying that. I kept coming up with the awareness of the binary system and I came up with a binary star and it kept reoccurring every time I would wake up. And I felt like I was living this idea that another star would appear and I am saying this in reference to who I am and my totality that I am wondering if this is some sort of future that I am going to live. Perhaps you are in that sense recognizing the mission of the spark of your creativity. But also in that sense there is what you would call a stellar relationship I will allow you to explore that on your own. I understand that two stars are basically usually gravitating around each other's pull. And I take that symbolically in my own life and more literally it is kind of interesting. If you are to continue to utilize that analogy I simply share with you that each star is self-complete. Perhaps purer wedding, perhaps sharing but not in any way depending upon each other. I will factor that in, it will be useful to me. And I think lastly right now I am just sharing for me I found a dead sparrow in my car. And it was a moving experience it might not be so much for everybody else but it was a powerful experience for me. And there was so much symbology behind it, you know the dead bird it was such a perfect beautiful little sparrow and I use it. And I use it in my own transformation and how that bird didn't know how to fly. Or it didn't know how to fly but it only knew one way to fly and it needed to die to transform to be able to fly a new preferred way. You also understand in no uncertain terms that it still lives on and has simply changed forms. So therefore you need not be as attached to the physical form although you can through the actions of your life celebrate that physical form. That's what I did, do you see it that way also? I mean kind of obvious to me. But you need not ask me for you have everything you need. Yeah. I thank you. Thank you. I have felt this magic of letting things happen and choosing in the moment it wasn't somewhat available. Oh not you too. But I guess the problem is I wish you the time. The situation that you have not allowed to transform. Yeah because when I touch that knowing of our limitlessness and our tremendous power to create there I get really scared of it. Well again one of the reasons that we shared and perhaps you can say through in to the introduction of this interaction that you cannot create a reality that you cannot handle is to address this idea. And what you are showing yourself in no uncertain terms is that you are now ready to rise to the occasion of your power. So simply you will always have that fear as a gauge and it will always be your choice not to expand who you are utilizing that fear as an excuse. But you will find that your willingness to simply do it perhaps sometimes referred to in your society as a leap of faith. Doing it even though you may feel some anxiety the results of those actions will provide the answers that you seek. But you will never be urged or nudged to go ahead any quicker than you desire here is your safety valve you will never be overwhelmed. So simply trust your timing. Trust how you feel and allow yourself to glean if that anxiety is simply an indication of that the timing is not yet or if it is an indication of your continuing to buy into the fact that your power can overcome you which you cannot. Where is the fact that my own personal belief system? Your societal approach to what you call your power is generally to have or into assuming that you have very little power that the power exists outside of you. So when individuals begin to understand that the power that they have seen around them in its magnificence and grandeur actually emanates from them then from the old perspective point of view it can seem a bit overwhelming. But you are acclimating, acclimatizing on a gradient and simply your willingness to as I have said dive into it, jump into it and just do it. So in that sense show you when you get a result that the anxiety was soundless. Oh thank you. Oh thank you I have done nothing. Is that all? Yes. I thank you. Shut it up. Amen. Amen. Oh here we go. Okay. As you make a member I sold a house a year ago and powerhouse and with an anti-go away I could get a whole lot of other things and a lot of growing and now I am kind of ready to move out of this area and work, we've had my book that has been overused for many years. No no. It has been exactly on the schedule. Great. It does not produce an anxiety-ridden belief. I don't know if I can say that. Obviously by the way. Thank you. So it seems like the West Coast is back to say it is my direction and I was wondering if you could give kind of a confirmation of what state or if that sounds good to understand it. And my simple suggestion is have a nice trip. Yes. Of course another thing is driving a car out there alone. Would that be two dangerous for me to go alone? Oh I don't know. What are you saying? How will you act? I'm going to drive carefully. Well that's the tentative nature that tentative approach is an action yes but it is an action presupposing that something can come in there and get to. Remember a defense is a supposition of an attack. Therefore is the same as saying you believe an attack is most imminent. Simply relax into who you are understanding that you have everything that you need and understanding that your timing is perfect. Also allow the feedback of your physical reality to be obvious. And if you feel perhaps this neighborhood is not the neighborhood I feel that I should drive through, trust it. Okay and then this idea of nutrition information centers. They're educating people about how to cook for special dietary considerations. They just wonder if that's what you bring in communities as both. The idea of cooking together and learning about food together. Is that the direction? To liberally use your language sounds yummy. And so the suggestions and how I can prepare for this independent. Once for one. Determine in any moment what is available, choose with your excitement, act with your integrity. That is all there is to it. Thank you. Very decidual. I thank you. Shilling, otherwise you may. Not too long ago I was bitten by a dog pretty badly. And I witnessed divine intervention during that experience. Well in a sense you witnessed synchronicity of your timing but do proceed. Well I want to explain what I mean by divine intervention. Oh please. When this dog attacked me, it wasn't attacked and after he bit me he literally walked away and are you familiar with what goofy our cartoon character? He walked away and my experience of him after he bit me was very animated. This is really anything beyond the fact that I thought divine intervention was what I experienced through that process. I was wondering if there is something more symbolic about that experience and why I would attract that type of experience. Well a few ideas. Understand again, you are a facet and expression of all that is. All that is need not be viewed as something separate which then needs to intervene in your affairs. You are an expression of all that is. In that scenario you chose in that sense to maintain a certain, perhaps you can say orientation, demeanor, representative of who you know yourself to be. Therefore initially you were approached by the reflected animal from its expectations of what a person may do when coming in contact with you then due to again the state of your resolve the animal reflected that resolve matched you in your pacified serene level. Therefore you intervene so to speak in your own affair. Now I bring this back to you for you need not in that sense again assign an external credit you get all the credit the dog in your society is the symbol symbolically the symbol of service and it simply reflected back to you your willingness once again to remain resolve and not take on feeling that you need to match the hostility. Do you understand what I am saying? Where does it hang up for you? Do you perceive that you maintain your resolve? Actually no I perceive that my higher my guides intervene. Now you have two possible explanations to ponder. Is there something else you wish to pursue in this regard? No I said that we did. My point to you is that you have done it all. There is as you say guide consciousness they in that sense do contribute to certain options that you feel you can act upon but ultimately you choose you act you create. They in that sense simply provide alternatives and in that sense provide suggestions but you in choosing from the plethora of alternatives and suggestions are the ultimate prime mover of your own reality. Or again our tendency is not to label it as divine intervention simply you redefining how you will create your reality and allowing the symbol of service to reflect that back to you. Does that make more sense? Thank you. Is that all? Yes. Thank you. Shut it. Oh sorry. I always just nice. Good. Add on. You all know. I have a question about certain ways that we may take action as humans and one question comes to mind. Do you people dream? Well we created a symbol separation in our reality. Perhaps you can say early on in our history that you would perceive as dreaming in the way that you are saying but you may understand that what would translate roughly three to five hundred years ago on our planet that one of the ways that our planet became telepathic was that we all at one time over a three day period with the appearance of our version of our Christ consciousness known in our ancient remnant language at Shaka Na that we did in that sense all fall asleep for three days and wake up into a collective daydream where we no longer assign the distinction between that certain things were possible in what you call the nighttime dream and other things were possible in the living of the daytime life dream. We no longer saw the need for the separation thus that we were ready to express our totality in the physical sense in our waking life so to answer your question we used to we no longer create the separation. But it helped you to act and move that's good different areas. It allowed us in that sense to understand in no uncertain terms that there is more to our consciousness than what we perceived at that time was our waking consciousness and similar it provides that service to you. You are such a multi dimensional being that in choosing to experience a finite reality such as this you provide periods of time to touch into more of that totality which you in that sense then express as nighttime dream reality. They in that sense those realities that you create an experience from our perspective are just as real as this reality. Some of them will represent realities close to this one. They will be the things that you seem to wake up with as a memory. Other things when you seem to wake up with the sensation of having been busy you know something happened but there is no symbol there is no memory there is no scene that comes back with it. Those are representative of experiences that are just as real as this reality but so vastly different that there is no vocabulary in this reality when you quote unquote wake up back into it to translate the experience. Well through many dreams that helps one to take action. Well it can allow you a format where you seem to be shall I say performing certain actions allowing yourself to see the results of that actions and then not having to continue to live with the consequences of those results. That is one my new use that you make of it. One might say that's a true awakening of some sort when someone is going to fully translate and move on from subconscious. Well from our perspective any given moment where you are cognizant of what is right in front of you you are fully awake. But that is another way to again express your totality again seemingly through finite means. Let me just think we have this one example of how we can act through our dreams. Well yes but what I am strictly speaking of is your actions in your waking dream in your life. Or that is what will have a result and an effect that you can see and experience in your waking life. The other dream in that sense again may provide the opportunity to the opportunity to experience alternatives. But then when you quote unquote wake up into this dream it will always be up to you as to what you do and the result you then receive in this waking dream. Well like this is what someone want to talk about. Oh thank you. Shut it. You're lying. Hey smile then she may. That's why I'm reading is just a time to start conversing with you. You have in that sense been involved with action. Yes action. Thank you. Yes. Well I felt a little nudging at the last session I came and I felt it was finally for me to pursue action. Oh. Since I did ever clear understanding I felt the words, the deeds they were necessary to put in progress. Well we thank you for the allowance of a reinforcement. So today I had what I consider to break through from myself and freeing up parts of my nature so that I can act more freely and I want to share that because it may be a service to others. I want to share and I guarantee you that it will. The nature of this is to have my allowance of my more aggressive side of my nature which I have maybe labeled negative previously to assert for myself what I want and what I prefer in my relationships with other people around me. And this comes out of like where I'm in a situation where I have an agreement with someone who doesn't match their part of the agreement or they do something that is not an agreement with what we have that I have the right to speak up for myself that I have the right to put out for what I want. Well thank you. Now you can always do so in a loving way and your willingness to be that creative will then give you the more preferred effect by not putting the other individual on the quote unquote defensive. Well I think I've always had the belief system that if someone is doing something seemingly to me it must be in front of you. That's a good point or it's an automatic situation where I am the victim this should not be happening whereas now I begin to see that I am not the victim this should be happening and it allows a more playful side of me to jump into the interaction as a sport as a competition where I can un-fime my hands from the sense of that I'm a victim or that I do something that you did the original binding but do proceed. Yes but I've done the original binding or that this person has done something wrong to me that I need to pummel them for which has never seemed to track you to me. Ah pummel alright. We do a lot of that on this planet to each other. Oh perhaps no longer but I understand. But that I have the rights to jump in and act with all my other resources. Ahh. But then you're ready. You are by the way expressing your power and acting according to the knowledge of your power. What you call pummeling is a helpless act. It is an act of desperation. Feeling that this reality is not at all within my control or domain therefore I must take drastic action and force it to conform to what I wish. That is not again an act of power and a knowingness of power. It is an expression of helplessness. Well I look at our world situation in countries like Bosnia where I see things where seemingly people are doing things that they shouldn't be doing to other people. And I begin to see there is a way of not matching that energy but providing your own vision of what you prefer this relationship to be between individuals or countries. That there is a different way of reacting which is not of being a victim and not wanting to destroy the other one but wanting to assert this is what I want in our relationship and I stand for that. Oh thank you. And anyway. You are doing just fine and our living example of what we are sharing. You will find though again due to what you are colloquially referring to as a breakthrough that your ability to do so will from this point forward be enhanced. And again as a simple reminder and suggestion your willingness to assert who you are is all well and good. Your willingness to do so in a loving way is the expression of your complete understanding of your power. The conditional love and expressing unconditional love is acting from your power. Well thank you very much. Oh thank you. Is that all? I believe so. Oh. Well thank you for your shining example. To me. My dear thanks to all of you. And to all of you as well. First let me ask you just mention to normal question that you fell asleep for three days and that happened about three hundred to five hundred years. I was thinking that is happening in hours now. Well in a sense you may understand that you have already had manifestations of the coming of your Christ consciousness. And as I have shared before and do not mean to rob it orally perhaps you will understand one of the differences that when hours was presented we listened. But you may also understand once again that how the Christ consciousness is now arising so to speak again is not through a single individual but through all of you collectively. And there will be a joy in the sharing of this collective unfoldment that will be distinctly different from our experience and unique to your own. Right, I was thinking of the time, the criminal as you said time. Well it is occurring now. It is occurring as you speak. Each time you perform an unconditionally loving act you are expressing the Christ consciousness within you. It is that simple. Therefore when you are acting that way you are being that style of integrated being. And you are acting another way you are expressing a reciprocal belief. But it is always your option in any given moment to unconditionally love yourself, unconditionally love those that you are interacting with and therefore express the Christ consciousness. It is not something you need to connect to or go to the store and get. It is something you contain and it is an option to express like all beliefs within you. I was just my observation was that it is happening on both planets at the same time in a way. In what way? There are differences in our physical timing. If you are in our future about three to five hundred years in our future then. This gets very confusing. Or again our time stream functions approximately ten times faster than your own. You are assuming again a one to one correspondence in the ticking so to speak of the clock. Now we have no clocks but understanding as an analogy there is simply no continuity or parallelism of the time frame. So it is not completely accurate to say that. So I come from my ideas question. Oh thank you. Perhaps these were the fake question. I would like to discuss a little bit more. It is kind of my question is in three parts kind of but they are all connected. If I was wondering if I could say all of it was exactly. Do you proceed? In employing the clear intention, 3 days and action approach the hunger by experiences with the fact of probability and the answer I come up with for that is trust. You have said this way and particularly many times that is what you have at all times. Are you talking about the blind trust? No no no. When you live your reality according to preference when you act according to your excitement you get results and those results provide the evidence that functioning that way is just as valid as any of the other ways we function. Everything I have ever done has always had a preferred result. Therefore it is not a blind trust to assume that it will continue to do so. It is simply my choice and my experience. Okay my feeling is we all have an interest at that time and in those cases of course we don't need to trust, we don't need to retouch. We are full of it. At times I just had that confidence. I know that I am on the right track. I don't decide to trust it. But when you are thinking that you are on the wrong track you are still trusting. You are trusting that you are on the wrong track. So you always trust in something. And trust is not something you need to build or exercise. It is always ever present. So it is a matter of seeing what am I trusting in. Do I wish to continue to trust in this? Not mustering up all this faith and trust. It's already there. It's like when I don't have that trust I don't know where to place my trust. But when you don't have that trust you are trusting that you do not have that trust. Now whether or not this is translating it is nonetheless still true. So if I had to make a decision I am not sure which would be the right decision. Allow me to cut through this. When you say I will allow my reality to be obvious. I will see what's available. And I will choose according to my excitement and act upon that excitement with integrity. You are displaying trust in action allowing you to trust that your excitement with integrity is an expression of who you are. So therefore in those such moments simply ground yourself. What's right here right in front of me? Oh this and that. Is this? No. Push it aside. I will do my options. Which one excites me? That one. Can I act on it with integrity? No. All right. Which one excites me second most? This one. Can I act on that with integrity? Yes. Do that thing. You are displaying in action the trust of who you are in every given moment. And there is no blind trust for that result will provide a positive experience in your life. Does that make sense? Yes I think what is difficult to do is whatever you are about to say for that is your rule. Nothing is difficult to do till you say it is and then act subtly or blatantly but sometimes subtly like it is difficult. That is an action. That is an orientation. That yields evidence. Yields results which show you yes. It must be difficult because here's the evidence. Well you just created the evidence through your action. If something is not available it is not available. If it is it is. That to me is simple and not difficult. Yes. Up till this point it has been difficult to accept that it's not available. Allow the reality to be obvious. Either you can act on something or you cannot. If you cannot again you can maintain it as a clear intention. You can ponder and examine it. But the moment you reground to what is available and act you continue the flow of your reality. The manifestations continue through the results of those actions. Yes so I will just make a comment on the last party. I listened to and have been utilizing many new approaches that you have talked about. This is my observation so far for our reality we still have to adjust to external implications which implies the force of a kind. No it is simply the recognition of how you have already created your reality many times through years of unconscious creation. So therefore there may seem to be a little lag when you begin to act according to preference of some of the results which were in that sense derived from unpreferred beliefs. Unpreferred emotions, unpreferred thoughts and actions but your willingness to allow yourself to transform these things, assign positive meaning and now act according to preference and positivity allows them to play themselves out and what it is replaced with is the results of the exciting things that you have done. So it is only a parentcy based on the old habitual ritual. Does that make sense? Yes I am from listening to you I can see that for you there is no adjustment necessary. It is all automatic. You have become one with what is and we haven't yet of course that is the simple. Well you haven't yet right in this moment because you just said so and that is the only reason. You decree whenever you speak who you are you lay down the rules you set up the template of your reality. You have the same ability simply from this moment forward express it and you will find nothing need be difficult. Reality will display its complexities but the mechanisms of believing of your life and your reality are that simple. And if you wish to derive what you perceive me to be as an inspiration all well and good but you would not appreciate what you see me unless you contain the desire to be this way and the desire and ability to express this. So use the inspiration that you are inspired by it to tell you that you contain it and decide the conscious from this moment forward. Anything from this moment forward is only difficult because you say so. I'm going to word it in a different way it's not difficult it's way fascinating it's exciting and I'm doing it and sometimes I don't do it but I'm doing it most of the time. Well understand when you quote unquote don't do it you are doing something in its place and that is yielding a result. So perhaps it peppers the soup a little bit but you can continue from this moment forward to just this side to be the person that you prefer to be. Three steps. One just decide who you wish to be. Number two trust that you have changed because you say so. And number three believe it or not surprise surprise act like you trust that you believe what you've decided. That is all it takes and that is how you already create your reality. Again because you already create your reality this way you are not meeting a new talent. It is simply now beginning to be more aware of the fact that you create that way and begin to insert preference and integrity. Is that closer? You have been a big help thank you very much. I just recently have discovered this idea of becoming one with the universe and opening up completely to the universe and just be the universe. I mean I had thought of this for years years and years disassembling myself and taking in the universe. And the idea is fine but putting it in action. If you are acting as an expression that you are the universe then you use the feedback of your reality you allow things in each moment to be obvious and you glean from what is available. That is all there is to it. I would love to see myself living having to face the moments when I'm feeling my side and bed about what is not available and how the hell is there. Then you are still to that degree in denial. In denial. Of whatever beliefs you are holding that result in the negative emotions. Negative emotions are messengers. They are coming to you to tell you how to expand. Denying them denies the belief that underlies them. Embracing them allows you to acknowledge the belief that you still express that you no longer prefer. Thank you. Thank you. You may now wish to say what a negative emotion comes up. For honest wings it brings an unpreferred belief. Look forward to what is left of the negative manifestations for they are the messengers of the remaining unpreferred beliefs you still express. Understand? Can I use an example in such a negative emotion or seeing what happened in different ways? I thought the way to do it was if something didn't happen that you expected to happen. Isn't the best way to say it's good that it didn't happen because something good will come out of it and still working on my negative emotions? If you know that something that you intend to do will happen and you are positive about it and it doesn't happen in a given moment. One who truly knows it would happen would not care and would act according to what is available knowing as you say darn well that the thing that you intend will happen and it's simply a matter of the perfection of the timing. If I say this too much then I don't even have to feel bad. Whatever you feel simply use that to glean what you must believe to feel that way. Emotions are the windows to your beliefs. So in any given situation no matter what the example is simply ask yourself what must I believe in this situation bring the reality bring the now moment bring the circumstances into it in this situation what must I believe to be expressing this sadness and you will have deliver a belief which you can then acknowledge and then transform by performing the actions of the preferred belief upon the acknowledgement of the non preferred belief is that clear. Thank you. You may all pause for a short break of 10 to 15 minutes of your counting. We will resume contact at that time. This is the end of part 1 proceed to take 2 for the rest of the interaction.
