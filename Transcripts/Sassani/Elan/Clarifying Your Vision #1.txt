 Welcome and greetings this evening of your time. How are you all? Oh thank you, perfect as well. Allow me to begin this interaction. Perhaps you can say the first of a three part overall intensive interaction. This particular interaction we have in that sense titled, Clarifying Your Vision. Next month of your time we will discuss definition and deserve ability. And the following month we will discuss action. Perhaps you can call this the Lights Camera Action Series if you wish. Therefore we will now begin with the overall foundation. We have discussed many times that you are the creators of your own reality. We have discussed many times that creating your own reality according to preference is simply a matter of a slight shift in perception. You already create your own reality and it is merely a matter of now beginning to factor in continuing to do so automatically, randomly hodge podge as you say, or beginning to take responsibility for creating your reality according to preference, enjoy from desire, which we have already to some degree discussed. Understand all that it takes to align or align your reality according to your preference is clarity of your vision. Now one other way to put this is clear intention, however for now we will refer to this simply as your vision. That being the thing, the event that excites you the most. As we have reminded you perhaps many times, though it is always the first time for us, your excitement is, the direct indication of who you chose to be in this life. This applies to the most exciting thing that you feel you may ever do and it also applies again, perhaps you can say microcosmically, to what is available in any given moment using that vibration, that perceptive sense that you have your excitement to determine what is most you and then act upon that option with integrity. In this interaction we will for the purposes once again of alignment focus more on the concept of the thing that excites you the most. Now in general we do not. In general we focus your attention to the moment, to what is available in the moment. But understand, lining up, aligning with the most exciting thing directly affects what occurs in the moment and allows whatever occurs in any given moment to actually be a stepping stone toward the most exciting thing. Therefore, in order to allow your reality to be a bit more consciously created according to preference, allowing yourself to fully, fully acknowledge the thing which excites you the most. Set up that clear intention. Set up perhaps you can say the vision which will represent one of the overall general themes or purposes in your life. One of the overall themes or purposes that you have created this life to discover. And therefore when aligning with that most exciting thing, your moment to moment reality begins to reflect this alignment. And though again the things that are in a given moment may seem to have nothing to do with the most exciting thing, when you etch, when you decide on the clarity of that vision, the establishment of that vision, each moment then has something directly to do with that vision. And what excites you in any given moment will now change for the things that will excite you will now be representative of the path of least resistance toward that most exciting thing. So it lays down a foundation. We are not in any way once again suggesting by this that you do this at the cost of remaining grounded in the moment, but simply to utilize as a compass, as a pointer, as a pointer, as a pointer. To where these moments will ultimately lead. Therefore allow me to begin by simply asking you all the requests, perhaps rhetorical for now. And when I ask it simply allow your mind to furnish you with whatever comes up without any judgment or analysis. All right. All right. For a moment, close your eyes. I simply will ask a question. Allow your imagination to furnish the answer in whatever form it comes. If it seems ridiculous, if it seems in that sense to run contrary to your normal, shall I say, utilizing your terminology points of view, simply allow it. So when I ask this question, what comes up for you? All right. Is everyone there? Just checking. The question is simply this. And I am asking each and every one of you this question personally. So therefore factor everyone else out. This is your question, what comes up in the screen of your imagination will be your answer. What truly excites you the most? Allow yourself to breathe and allow yourself in once again the theatre of your imagination to provide any symbol or any impression that comes up. We will allow a moment for this. Times up. Now, from time to time in interacting with members of your society, not to draw any conclusions from this, not to make any generalizations, but individuals will simply say, well, I do not know what excites me, to which we will always reply. Yes, you do. First of all, understand in no uncertain terms, you do know what excites you. When you say that you do not, you simply withhold your ability to access what you all already know. But what perhaps we have not shared is that individuals who would seem to not be privy to what excites them will generally withhold that impression from themselves for one of free general reasons. Number one, judgment of that thing by your society. Now, perhaps more accurately, you're buying into the judgment about the exciting thing that your society seems to heath upon it, or understand. It is never a product of their judgment which prevents you from doing anything, and never can their judgment even have any effect on your own. You can't affect on you whatsoever until you match or create your version of their judgment in the form of self-judgment. Well, everyone knows you can't do that. So therefore, that will be one of generally free reasons that you will find that you will from time to time not allow yourself to access what excites you. So this is why we say no matter how seemingly ridiculous it may seem, when asking yourself what excites me allow anything to come up. Number two, will be something that we have discussed in some detail, which is a quote unquote fear that you could not achieve what excites you. Again, I remind you that this is a paradox. The fact that it excites you tells you is the indication of your pre-requisite ability to do that thing. So it is a paradox. Remind yourself, relabel that your excitement not only tells you that this is most you, but then by extension that obviously you have the ability to do this thing. There are no dangling carrots in creation other than the ones you choose to create. So therefore, the mere fact that it excites you in that sense, shall I say, allows you to know in no uncertain terms that though it may not be obvious in that moment how this thing can come about, my excitement tells me it absolutely can. Number three, there is a general overall feeling that many individuals, and again we have discussed this as well, that upon achieving quote unquote the thing that excites them, that they will not have the ability to actually do that thing, that they actually do not have enough power or perhaps fear quite the opposite, that they could not handle the power that would come along with the fulfillment of that exciting thing. And again I remind you simply, there is nothing that you can ever create, nothing that you cannot handle. Otherwise there would be extraneous creation, and I remind you there are not. Everything by virtue of the fact that it exists tells you by definition that it belongs. So understand the message that excitement delivers. Number one, it tells you you can do that thing. Number two, it tells you that when doing that thing you will have more than enough power to continue to do that thing, and that that power can never overcome you for it is an expression of you. So therefore, should you find in asking yourself what excites me the most, these barriers arising, simply dialogue with yourself, utilizing the reflections that we have just shared and ask yourself again, what excites me the most, allow it to come up, allow yourself to feel it, allow yourself to validate it. Understand once again that most literally though you perceive yourself as physical matter, you are energy, you are consciousness itself. Therefore you are a frequency of energy, literally a wavelength, a frequency, a spectrum of energy. When you establish your clear vision, you in that sense conform the frequency of your reality to the frequency of your desire. So therefore understand that it is not merely a mental exercise to clarify and establish your clear intention, it is literally the initiating step that sets up the energy template, the model that quote unquote your reality then grows upon so to speak. Therefore it is not merely an exercise but a foundational statement of conscious creativity. If you are willing to acknowledge what moves you, what excites you, you are clarifying your vision, you are focusing down on the overall idea that right now is most representative of who you are. Again it is like into dialing perhaps you can say a phone number or in that sense a particular address. It tunes you to the preference of what exists in your reality. So we cannot emphasize enough that your willingness to allow yourself to be aware of what excites you the most sets up the vibration that allows your life to fall literally into place through coincidence, through the seeming strangest of events. And once in a while to keep it interesting through the obvious course of events as well. Understand you already do this in various forms. You already reaffirm, reassert some intention. Very often it is that you constantly repeat, I cannot do the thing that excites me. I cannot achieve the thing that excites me. This is the establishment of a vision. This is establishment of an intention perhaps not according to preference but nevertheless it is the same thing as an intention because it is a statement by you. And perhaps you may understand that in that aspect the universe is quite neutral. It does not read into what you are saying and interpret it takes you quite literally. So when you affirm I cannot do what excites me. I cannot do what excites me. You are clarifying a vision that lays down the foundation for reality that results in the effect of not being able to do what excites you. Brings the evidence along with it that yes you cannot do what excites you for that is what you are continually stating as your belief and setting up foundationally then again emotions thoughts and actions correspondingly. So you already use vision, use intention. Though again it is generally a random effect. Simply you need not cease being random and run away from the random approach. By establishing consciously your clear intention you automatically distance yourself from the old approach but not by running from it in an invalidating way. But by validating and acting according to the new approach automatically do you distance yourself from the negative or reciprocal of what you say you prefer. In the second half of this interaction what you call after your break we will perform a short perhaps you can say guided visualization that will once again enable you perhaps in more detail. Perhaps in more symbolic terms to focus in to hone in to tune literally in on what excites you. But first we will allow the settling perhaps you can say of some of the information that we have just shared in terms of what you create as impediments and in terms of your new way to address these ideas and allow your excitement to be delivered to you on a silver pleasure. Now before we begin I again remind you once you establish your overall vision your overall intention you will either be able to do something to act in this moment toward that particular end or not. If you can by all means act do whatever is most obvious is there for a reason and will stand out in your reality for a reason. But once you have established the clear intention you no longer if it is not available in the moment need fixate upon it, obsess upon it but simply check in with it. Is it available is there anything that I can do right now toward my vision yes do it no all right what can I do something about and remind yourself maintain that clarified vision and move forward from what is available. Therefore again you do not use the most exciting thing as an excuse in any given moment not to do the things that are exciting in that moment but simply use it as a tool of alignment to remind yourself this is what I will settle for no less than in my life. This excites me this is obviously one of the reasons key reasons I am here therefore I will allow it to unfold into my reality and I will allow it to be an ecstatic process by continuing to maintain it as a clear vision while acting from what is available on the things that excite me. Now that is an exciting and ecstatic life that replaces your quote unquote old momentum the illusion of momentum with a quote unquote seemingly new preferable momentum. Again momentum is an illusion overall but it is an apparent and can also be used to your advantage once again you seemingly establish the momentum of your excitement with integrity. Allow me now to once again thank you all it is not only an honor but an ecstatic joy to interact with you particularly now that you are on the cusp of a whole new understanding in your society. Many things are occurring many things will continue to occur many exciting ideas are just around the corner as you say and therefore it is our joy that on some level obviously by the fact that I can communicate with you in this way you have invited us to participate. Perhaps on the sidelines for now but the idea is you would have it no other way it is your game and therefore you make the rules and you determine the quote unquote outcome as you say. We thank you for your willingness to allow you to be part of our vision for we are all truly related in the essence sense we are very literally brothers sisters cousins parents children in many ways in many differing and different styles of relationship. Therefore again it always is an ecstatic joy to interact with you we thank you for the honor we thank you for the opportunity to behold your culture at such a time of transformation upon your planet. Due to this willingness I ask you now how I may be of service to you and vice versa. I believe we had an interaction a couple of weeks ago mentally more and you do not sound like you. Doubt and simply a word for misplaced trust not a lack of trust due to see. I was having a network chiropractic session and there was a lot of energy work going on and I felt sheara in the room and then I saw her sort of death aside and then I saw sort of saw you and Bishar and you and I embrace and it was very beautiful and I just want to acknowledge that. I will thank you I absolutely believe that it occurred. But what I want to share with you is that especially over the last month the expansion of the visualization I've held for a long long time has finally happened. I think what I would call I don't know what you would call it I'm now a healer I'm doing energetic healing and I'm very very grateful and celebratory for it. Oh well I assume all that gratitude is placed where it belongs upon yourself but due proceed. You have done it all. Thank you. I'm ecstatic. I'm so excited. I'm beginning to believe. I'm seeing physical changes in people. I'm seeing emotional changes and spiritual changes. Well again I remind you as you change who you are you shift your perspective as well therefore very literally as you change others seem to change so you may use the reflection the echo of the symbols as self validation as well. I'm so taken by it I feel like I just want to do it like almost all the time so exciting to me. Oh right go right ahead. Along with the energetic opening in the laying on of hands and the channeling of energy there has come what we call speaking in tongues. Oh a form of china literal. Okay and I wanted to understand this a little more because I thought it was something that just happened once in a while and since this is open for me three weeks ago it's really present all the time and any time I relax and especially if I see something very beautiful it's ready. It's just there and I have control over it I can do it or I can allow it to release and I don't I mean I've heard definitions of it as it's the Holy Spirit. I don't know if there's a beautiful energy with it I felt it a lot when you were first you know beginning to speak and now my vibration has changed and I feel a real sweet connection with you and I'd love to hear your definition of what it is. Well first of all may I ask you have you created the recognition of what you call translation of what you are bringing through or do you still separate the information at meeting translation externally. When it first started the first night I received clear phrases a few times during the period of time that was happening and they were they came in English there was Christ was involved. Do you understand what you generally refer to as speaking in tongues will translate as physical vibrations that are quote unquote not of your English language but to understand my particular overall overview of what you are beginning to do is simply more verbally be willing to chat. Whatever form that you will decide that will take will be up to you I understand that to some degree you have done that but you are to the next level so to speak. I'm starting. Now I definitely. Well I mean it sounds like repetitive gibberish on the outside on the internal it's just a feeling and knowing I don't I don't get messages with it in the moment but then I have more channeling going on in general. Well in a sense you may understand the priming of a pump and the allowance of it to come through in whatever form it will rather than how you assume it should be is part of the process of setting up such a relationship as you are perceiving before you with myself in the channel. And I think that's what it means to you will align your understanding with the verbal expressions themselves and eventually take the form of shall I say if you work English. It feels like divine mother energy very beautiful you will feel many different relationships with not only that but again I remind you that the more practical if it comes to you the more you will find joy in sharing. And then finally along with this there was when this first started about three weeks ago there was a big energy surge going through me I had to have sessions with different forms of healers like every three to five days. Well you chose to. And I felt you know people couple of them said they felt like something was coming into me well in a sense you are simply opening what already occurs within you and allowing it to be expressed many perhaps times you can put this as simply you are clearing your channel. Right what my interpretation was that it was hitting all tightness which is why there's a lot of jerking of the body and vibration and the mumbling will also understand that that quote unquote jerking and vibration will also be representative if you are willing to view it that way of specific cellular releases. So you can look at it that way as well your cellular releases of the constrictions but in your perception that is a physical correspondence to your perception of what is going on. And if I were to translate this in another form it would feel like in a sense I am evolving into Shira which is me well that is literally so in many ways. And therefore you may understand that if you are attracted to the symbol of your future self that yes you may understanding that you are becoming that self to ride joy from. Very female energy and strong and very well. Thank you. Oh thank you. You have done it all and simply allowed me the joy of sharing. I thank you. I seem to have a lot of different things that excite me. I have a couple of questions in our relationship to that. Oh right. I wonder by not clarifying my vision and to say one most exciting thing. Am I heading in a lot of different directions that might conflict. Well can be. Now the idea is not to squelch anything that excites you. But however you have given up the opportunity to simply explain the following. When there is more than one thing that excites you at the same time. There are other cues or feedback from your reality that can allow you to understand where it would behoove you to act in which direction it would behoove you to actually move in. And this is simply accessibility. You will generally find once again that though you may be excited about many things perhaps what you would even consider to be equally that generally usually one will stand out as being immediately or more immediately accessible right now. So when there is more than one thing that excites you factor in accessibility availability of its. Shall I say. Ability to act upon in the moment. Did that translate? Yes. Now does that from the choices that you have provided yourself allow one to stand out. I think it would. We're either using. Or the other thing or overall idea is the trust in the timing. That is part of your literal feedback that you can use from your reality to again. I acknowledge that you create your own reality and any perception in it is feedback for you to realign with your preference. Okay. I think you've sort of answered the second question as to how to clarify my vision and then. But I guess I'm still I guess I still wonder if having a number of things that excite me might lead to conflict. Well again. When one is more physically accessible you will align to that. And as you move through your life either continue to be excited about those things or find that you no longer are. You may understand again that excitement is literally a thread that leads to all other excitement and should your excitement shift about a particular thing it will simply no longer matter to you whether or not you do that thing. But if the excitement remains there will again generally be a lining up of the physical events in your reality that will then allow the next thing to be the most accessible of the things that excite me. So we do not suggest that that will scatter you but simply again use the most physically accessibly active upon option and maintain the rest as clear vision. Is that of sense? Thank you. Oh thank you. Shutting. You're on. Greetings. As you and Bashar have known for some time my number one excitement is the water fuel cell energy project that I'm somewhat involved in for almost three years now. This will simply represent for those who are unaware a particular shall I say newly proposed form of energy that rather than relying on what you call exhaustible resources will produce what you call electricity from what you call water. Do proceed. I desire very much to play a major role in introducing this new science or product to benefit all mankind on this planet. Do you trust by the way that that excitement is your indication of your ability to perform that task? Do you trust that? I totally trust that I have the capability to do that. My big question is to the extent that you can give me any guidance given the current energies if you will predicting the future when might this hit the marketplace. The first product will be retrofitting cars and light trucks to use water instead of gasoline. And whether it's six months from now or two years from now has a lot to do with what I do in the interim. Now our particular perspective, understand it simply at sensing in this moment of momentum again colloquially speaking of energy and probability. Understand that this can shift. But shall I say what I am rendering to you as my perception of the shall I say most likely time frame right now takes into consideration shall I say many of the individuals more closely associated with that particular project. Now do understand that everything is perfect. All timing is perfect. Your knowledge of what I am about to say can affect and transform the outcome. You may again wish to play around with your own threshold of believability meter. But our particular perception right now is what you would call that the likelihood of this playing out would be three to five of your years. Oh dear. Next month, June, my unemployment runs out. Well how exciting to be any avoid that is more representative of your employing yourself rather than shall I say being entitled to something for nothing. I agree. Therefore I face the challenge, the opportunity of filling this interim period until I can really get involved in the water fuel cell project with financial viability. Oh, then allow us to use you as an example. You obviously are as you have said very excited about this project. It would obviously seem right now anyway to not immediately be actively the possible upon. What then stands out as the next most exciting thing. What excites you that you have not shared with me. I'm drawing a blank because my whole focus has been on the water fuel cell. That is exactly why you are drawing as you say a blank. So perhaps later on when we partake together in the exercise, you will draw something a bit more accessible than a blank upon the canvas of your imagination. There is something else that does interest you. It is not that unobvious that in that sense being more accessible will lead you more quickly or at least in that sense have you seeming to create less time in between the culmination of your other project. I am not sure if you will. I am sure you will be able to make more of that new experience here. We will not put it off into the future but if you wish, I will allow you. Thank you. Perhaps I will ask you how yours ones mine are always ecstatic. That will simply depend. What you would call our mother craft would perhaps have what you call lakes within them. So there are differing options of how this is done. I personally shall I say prefer my planet itself when available. Given the two options, the planet will excite me more. Well, we haven't quite gotten warm enough yet for swimming here but it will be soon. Oh, have you yet had a memory of what I am speaking of? No, I haven't. Oh. But I intend to. Happy train. I would like to ask a question about the difference for a clarification of a past session. It was the take of desire and allowance. And I listened to it over and I can't reconcile these two states. Oh, how exciting. There was a discussion about Atlantis and its destruction. You said in reference to Atlantis, the mentality had become one of deparations and need to dominate, etc. And you said full uncle shook the place apart. Well, in a sense, you may understand that what you call the destruction of Atlantis was shall I say the effect of many happening. That fulminated so to speak in one event, but there were shall I say minor disruptions prior to that. Does that reconcile the difference? No. Oh. A little later in the session, tell me asked about that statement. You said we never said that. Then something about Malbec. Am I hearing it wrong? I feel it all wrong. There was a misinterpretation within the channel. You heard it perfectly. We thank you. All right. Good. It happens from time to time. Yeah. Well, rarely. Rarely. Oh. Really rarely. That's the first time I've come across something I couldn't explain. We have been aware of a few but have found them to be generally insignificant to our overall intentions. From time to time, we will so to speak, bridge of retraction. It does not occur. Also with regard to clarification, it's made a big difference for me to be aware of the fact that we see what we believe and it's not the other way around. Well, again, often individuals in describing what you call your physical senses will refer to them as the windows to the world. But it is our perception that they are the filters that filter out 99.9% of all reality to give you some sense of finite focus. So we will believe systems line that entire system, which is aligned to itself. And you literally see what you will expect to see. You literally create the evidence and perception of that which you believe to be most likely. That is little. It also makes it easier to understand how their people's viewpoints. Oh, right. Absolutely. And it then allows you to have compassion and not need to have pity for the ones who may choose less empowering viewpoints. It is simply that they too have the right and get to play out the results of their choices as well. And that is the degree of the overall unconditional love of all that is to allow everyone to do so. This is why we will generally address the notion of extraterrestrials coming down to save you as a disservice. And not a recognition of your complete self-empowerment and right to choice. One more question. Oh. Since everything is a value of you from will a right reason to resist. Is there any such thing as a lie to false perception and state? Just like that. Well, again, it is all arbitrary and a matter of viewpoint and perspective. Is there any doubt? There is what you would call deception, purposeful deception from one individual to another. We are not saying in any way that this does not serve purposes but may not be, shall I say, the most integrated and above-board way to do so. So it depends exactly what you are asking. Well, that answers you. Perhaps it is more semantics than anything else. Yeah, okay. But what we mean is that if an individual believes something which would seem to not apply to anyone else, they will still live the result of it for them and it is no lie. For the rest of the society perceiving from their point of view, they may continue to only reconcile it in understanding that individual is lying to himself. So in one way, yes, there are no lies but perhaps again in more of the intentional way that you separate your communication by the way, not only from each other but from yourselves. You can create this idea of deception. Great. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Which means we love you in our ancient language. Shriek. Hi, Lord. Grecian. Thank you for coming. A few weeks ago, I was sitting beside a stream in a meditation for a period of time. Did you go with the flow? I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. Well, this seems to me, what she thinks, that the point or the intention of the meditation was to, um, what to seek through the illusion of separation from the stream. And to seek through the illusion of my separation from anything else that was around you. Well, this is literally a matter of identification as, or again, literally in this case, going with that flow. But do proceed. And I was, I was instructed to, um, listen to the river to what it had to tell me to talk about, a great length of that flow. And it kept talking about flow and I kept writing it. And then I saw... And resistance, by the way, but do proceed. Yes. Right. And, um... I saw rocks. Sloot apart. I saw rocks breathing. Getting larger and smaller. And I saw rocks. Sloot apart and turn and come back together. Do you expect me to find this at all unusual? No, I just did what it was. Well, I just did that, that the idea that a rock is just stationary still. There's no movement in it. Well, there is, shall I say, an infinity of movement within it. But your perception is that it is not. And it is literally made, so to speak, of the same consciousness that you are, though it is a different expression, literally a denser conglomeration of consciousness. So what you were perceiving is the underlying consciousness within all reality. Nothing, nothing is outside this consciousness. Everything is an expression of it. Well, it amused me at the time. Just didn't say that. You can go to the contrary to the belief of some things that I've involved in. Well, not anymore. But what I wanted to ask you about was, and what kept coming through also, was name Elijah. So, over and over, I can't get the name Elijah that day and other day. And I was wondering if you could expand on that for me. Simply, access the obvious available literature upon your planet. Read the quote unquote stories of this individual. And glean why you have attracted such a story. It is quite obvious. And you will find within it many ideas, not simply one. But again, it is part and parcel of what we have already discussed, which is the idea of you attracting appropriate symbology according to perfect timing. Therefore, your biblical literature would be the suggestion of where we would, in that sense, suggest starting. Thank you. Oh. Thank you. Sure. Oh, yes. Thank you for stopping by today, Elijah. I am not precisely stopped, but I understand the rest of it. It's been quite a month since I spoke to you last. By the way, upon my planet, when one says, boy, you're really in orbit, they mean it literally. Deep. When I was down in St. Lucia, there was just an endless stream of synchronicity and symbols taking place. Did you have a nice vacation? Yes. Did your reality crumble around you while you were away? It did, but I wasn't paying any attention to it. I was having too much fun. Well, then it did not. But a string of things happened related to the now which you told me to work on. Oh, no, no. Never told you to work on anything. Yes, it does. I might focus my hand. Pay some attention to it. Thank you. I ended up climbing up a hillside because I had gotten myself in a position where I couldn't backtrack and a few hundred feet up. My foot slipped. And there was that brief moment between when my foot slipped and when it landed on a rock a couple feet below, that I was in the now very much. Oh, no. You need not continue to do with that place, but that is one way. So what was going through my mind at the time was at that moment were other worlds spinning off where that rock did not appear underneath my foot to catch me. Well, perhaps in one literal sense, yes, but they have nothing to do with whom you have chosen to be. Right. So the literal occurrence is representation of who you have chosen to be. Right. So you're losing your footing, so to speak, was quite relevant to what you are exploring. But the idea is that no matter what occurs, you will always regain your footing. You need not perceive again that your reality crumbles from hundred. No, but it was quite an exciting moment. And what I was, what went through my mind was your discussion of choice and that what I had in front of me at that instant was a world where the foot did not stop and the body probably wasn't ever found again, or a world where the foot did stop. And I was able to choose between those worlds that have spun off. So then it's not really a case of having to create the worlds that are spinning off. They automatically generate themselves, but you merely choose the path of worlds to link yourself to your destination. Oh, that is one way to look at it for sure. Well, I was just trying to clarify that for myself. So it's the point of the experience, or shall I say one of them, there will be as many points as you choose to glean once again was you do have the choice and that choice lies in the mob in the midst of the event. And you made that choice and allowed that reason. One of the things that I was trying to do was that I was exploring down there. Why I have such an enormous fascination for racing up hillside. I think in that particular case, and the hillside is not really small hillside either. I think in that case, there may have been a past life where I was trying to escape the carnage that was taking place on that very particular rock. But I don't think that that's the sole reason as to why I tend to race up mountains without even stopping for water or a breath many times. Is there some message that I'm supposed to be getting about the climbing of mountains? Because later than the next week, there was a very strong experience that happened in the same regard. Well, generally, that symbol, that literal occurrence will represent what you refer to as spiritual exploration. Ascending, perhaps you can say, into the spiritual realms. Now in that particular instance, obviously it is be moving to keep your feet firmly on the ground at the same time. So it is an exploration of combining, not doing one idea at the cost of the other. Simply the spiritual at the cost of the physical or vice versa. Therefore, that will be the embodiment of the, shall I say, marriage of physical and spiritual. The next week, I ended up climbing one of the pitons on the island and spent the night up there. It was the full moon in May, which I understand is often referred to as the Weesop Festival in the Himalayas, and has supposedly an enormous amount of meaning to the Shambhala. That's what I've been pursuing this notion. And what did you create as an experience around that? Thank you. I got up there and the anecdote of the pen cap was hysterical. I have to thank you for that. I won't go into detail now and take a peoples' time, but I can explain it later. But I was told in no uncertain terms the pickup of had a paper and sit down and start writing. I had this back track for a second. The view from this peak was so spectacular. It was such a narrow needle sticking up out of the water. It was about 3,000 feet high, 2,800 or 3,000 feet high. And it was so steep that when you stood on the top, you could only see for about 10 or 15 feet in any direction. And then it just fell away to about 2,500 or 3,000 feet below. And the clouds were almost underneath you. It was such a sensation of an island in the sky just floating above the world. And it was such an extraordinarily peaceful sensation that I just had these directions to start writing these opinions down. And it was extraordinary. Well, it still is. Now, how do you wish to continue to express that? Well, obviously I've got a lot of writing to do. I did some automatic writing at that time, and it was very powerful. Now perhaps also you may understand more. Literally, you have a lot of living to do as well. Remaining grounded with again the maintenance of the spiritual connection results in what you would call a zeal for life, a zeal for the living of the life. And again, if there is an overall purpose that perhaps you can say you all share, it is to be the best you you can be. Though you are a multi-dimensional, infinite, and eternal being, you are reincarnational being with your understanding of that terminology. You are, at the same time, only this you one time. Perhaps another way to put this is this precise you only has one life to live. Therefore, many of the approaches of your various philosophies need not be considered mutually exclusive. They are complementary. On the one hand, yes, you do live the one life as this particular you, but on the other hand, there is also the idea of continuity and reincarnation. So, living now, that is how. What can I do to facilitate my ability to receive these transmissions on a more regular basis? Well, first of all, by participating in clarifying your vision to some extent you already have. But again, remaining grounded in the moment and utilizing the excitement in the moment as well, not only with the overall concept is key and is part of living now. So, allow yourself in no uncertain terms to clarify your particular vision and allow it to lay down a foundational template for you. Basically, I got the message of my vision that I have been thinking about quite a bit is not so much physical healing, but healing of the heart and to try and do that through writing. Well, the healing of the heart can be expressed through writing. But ultimately, again, we are using your own colloquial language in that there is a necessity to heal, which is not our perspective exactly. But the effect that you are describing is simply through the acknowledgement of the emotions as they come up. Denial stores, so to speak, those emotions as we have referred to a closet. But what we have not often shared is that where you will feel this experientially is the heart. So, acknowledgement of all your emotions is the reinforcement of perhaps, again, colloquially the help of the heart. Denial is, in that sense, the constriction of the flow through the heart. Denial is often based on fear. Fear that what you are experiencing can overcome you, which, again, is impossible. Therefore, not only that you are feeling fear in a given moment, but the fact that you are feeling it in that moment is significant of the fact that in that moment, if you choose to acknowledge that fear, you can transform it. It is showing you the perfect timing. Each time an emotion that you do not prefer comes forth, it is your higher self handing to you on a silver platter a dated belief that has resulted in that emotion. So, acknowledgement results in the uncluttering of the heart chakra. Denial, in that sense, would seem to congest it. And you will literally find what you call occurrences of heart attacks, so to speak, upon your planet, to generally, in one form or another, directly be the result of denial. This is not in your medical literature, perhaps someday it will be. Thank you. The last thing that I saw when I left that island, where the rather spectacular site, is about two or three o'clock in the morning, and I was looking at open the ocean, and suddenly in the view behind the piton came this enormous ship with its sails illuminated. And I don't know if I've ever seen a ship just out in the ocean with its sails very brightly lit. It was a rather spectacular site. Thanks. Also quite against Zimbabwe. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of the harnessing of the energy that exists all around you, there is nowhere to go. You are already always right there. And I think that probably even more to be green from that than what you just described. Well, we did not want to take all the fun out. Well, I think it was a message of an illuminated journey. And just beginning. So what was the firefly that then it, surely thereafter, almost immediately after, came and made a quick loop around my head and then took off? Simply a momentary reflection or spark of your brew, showing you the degree to which you two can shine. If you will simply, and all it takes is agree with what I say, and act that way. Oh, thank you. I have done nothing. Shut him. Hey, smile. Hello. Hello, my. Greetings. It took my eyes to get close for a while. Well, I was playing around with vision. Have you clarified your vision or do you still need glasses? I need a question. That last year I kind of filled my sails. So just call me off guard. In clarifying your vision, is it better to look at the final goal or can you set a goal in between? Well, again, what you are referring to as goals in between may come up and we do not suggest you squelch them when they do. But simply allow whatever is now occurring to you to be obvious. You need not look or search very hard for what excites you. It is constantly right there saying, look this way. So it's okay to visualize the maximum experience. Well, again, not fixating or obsessing upon it, simply etching it into the blueprint of your mind. All right. That's clear. You are clarifying your vision. Yeah. And I'm expelling that and I feel very clear about it. You all are and understand being that in very many ways you are moving together not to take anything away from your individuality. You will find quite a reinforcement or perhaps you can say supportive atmosphere from each other. So, okay, I'll just try and go with that and see what happens with the vision afterwards. Oh. Visualization afterwards in the second half. I do have a comment about, I've been really into this triad. I've been so aware of this so-called triad which encompasses Earth, and S.S.A.S.S.A.N.I. and Sirius. And you call that the Sirius triad. Well, no, we call it the Earth, S.S.A.S.N.I. The Sirius. Understand that it equally comprise them all and therefore would be in that sense a disservice to only ascribe it to one source. But again, it is simply symbolic and perhaps you'll have little to do with your daily life. No, I know that. And that's why I've been interested so much in that awareness has come to me over the past month. And it's come up in dreams and it came up in a meditation in one of the chambers yesterday. And I'm interested in how it's reflecting on myself. I mean, I'm in this conversation with you and then this collective energy of Sirius, which is a lot of fun. Well, then we're energetic, shall I say. Perhaps one of your colloquialisms that will suffice when in that sense allowing one to be aware of interacting with that energy is fast in your seat belt. I went into this chamber yesterday during the day for about an hour. And I just found myself, you know, being led to this meditation and seeing the triad. And I felt this serious energy there. And the name Siskeen, which is their energy. Well, it will in that sense relate to what you call their mass conscious, Christ consciousness. Like ours is Christ. And the name will simply then depend on the civilization's translation of it. And so when we like we can tune into you so called phone number with a triangle and all these other societies have their own little symbols. Well, again, simply how you feel when interacting with me is the most powerful attractant. How do other societies feel when they want to tune in with us? Well, the point is how do they feel to you thinking about them in that sense pondering about them brings up a feeling and that is the phone number itself. So in this meditation, I did a lot of things, but one of the biggest things was I created this door and it was a golden door and there was this white light creeping through the edges of the door. And I said, okay, I'm going to open it. And I opened it and it was just surrounded by, you know, creation of white light, which is beautiful. And I stepped through and in and slowly faces emerged out of the white light. And there were just little faces, no heads. And what I saw the most was their eyes were very childlike. And they were very gentle and loving and welcoming. And then also their heads of shape. And their heads were like an upside down teardrop, a raindrop. And I don't know if this was serious of that energy or what or if it wasn't that. Well, perhaps again, one of the points is that you have established communication directly. They will in general present themselves as a mass consciousness, though from time to time for particular reasons and purposes may seem to appear as an individual. Any physical descriptions that you are getting impressions of would literally be remnants of their ancient history according to your own timeframe and flow and stream of time. So therefore, again, perhaps it is a past, so to speak, impressions. If you wish for a symbol, what you call three dots, spaced in what you would call the points of an equilateral triangle, one, two, three, in that sense would represent that particular vibration. For though your scientists now assume serious to be a binary system, they will soon understand that it is a trinary system. Well, it's quite synchronous, because last Saturday night I was going to go pine-mander to speak to you and I didn't make it, but that night I had a dream that I was sitting in my yard and the Andrew and all of us were sitting in my yard having this interaction. Which, by the way, when you create such an experience is a literal experience. And you will find if you ask the physical channel from time to time, he will dream of, as you call it, channeling session. It was great, and we were there in my yard and we were having the session, I didn't need to go pine-mander. And then we all looked up and we were pointing in the sky, and in the sky were three dots, three stars that had culminated together and created this triangle. And that is the point, and that was that. So I understood that, and it's funny because I went on, but quickly I was asking you. The connection, by the way, that we were simply making is the reference of that being symbolic of the serious energy. That may not have been completely obvious at the top. So I asked for an individual from Syria who is guiding me, or I'm feeling their energy through these chambers and through hacking on what excites me. And I asked for assistance, and I asked for identification of this individual, and I got, it wasn't an individual, it was a collective consciousness of the fourth, fifth, sixth, and sixth. And you may also find that you will also, from time to time, feel the inclusion of what you call your own dolphin population, where they are telepathically in touch with that society as well, and have been for many hundreds of your years. So that's what I got in the chamber yesterday. Oh, they did. Do not mean to spoil all of it. That's what I got. I said, you know, Dear James is what I heard, and I heard this very gentle Christ-like voice, and it said, what you seek is in the oceans. You know, I go over the golfed off, and this is one of the things. Well, the idea, again, that is not all that you seek. No, I know. I just took it as like, there's information. I can receive a lot of information directly. The first alien species that your civilization can contact is in your own backyard. And that, in very many ways, makes your planet somewhat unique. Now, not that this does not occur at all, but in general, you will not find too so divergently different sentient species upon the same planet. Yes, so, particularly ones that, in this case, do not necessarily even recognize each other. Now, to some degree, they recognize you more than you are willing to recognize them societally, but this is changing. Now, the reason I'm doing this is I feel the serious energy is linked through a Native American energy, and better than I come up with this, the spirits of so-called manatee, if you will, at these chambers, okay? And it's important for me to access this way, I think, because I'm so aware of the spirits there that I went to a video there a few weeks ago, and I had this major equipment problem. And I feel like I'm being, you know, so- A equipment problem. An equipment- What's your question? Oh, the equipment situation that the batteries died immediately. Try to fall down the road. And what I didn't do, I didn't really pay homage to the spirit. I didn't, you know, I'm so aware of it that I didn't really have a greeting or any sort of meditation. And that was interesting. Well, you need not be that rigid, and assume that what you are communicating with is that rigid, but you may understand, simply, keep it simple, that that was simply not the time to feel it. Yeah, it wasn't. So therefore, did you then re-ground yourself to what was available or lament about your camera? No, I went to Willa and looked at it as, well, this is the thing. I'll go home and think about it. Oh, yeah. I found out that I needed to do something else before that, which was, you know, taking another avenue on this project. It wasn't just your go running out and shooting. Well, we thank you. Shut it. Oh, wait a minute. I have a couple of things. Oh. One is, well, I can have a vision. My vision is two parts to it though. Oh, how exciting. Multipart vision. One for each eye. Right. And I don't know if they're related to the other, but so I've always had this vision. So I feel real good about that. But what's happening to me, or what's happening to me, how is this? What you are creating and expressing in your life is... A lot of old stuff is coming up from the bottom of the dredges, I guess. Well, that is one way to look at it. Another way to look at it is to embrace it all as a new and relevant to this moment, to be transformed in this moment without the weight of the baggage of the historical aspect of it. Yeah, exactly. I do that. My whole mind gets exhausted. Well, understand, it is not the same old thing, literally anyway. It is a new thing, perhaps quite similar to something you have already experienced, but until you give it the continuous label of being that old thing, it has much less weight. And you can simply isolate it. This is new. Right now. Who am I right now? How do I think about this right now? What am I acting like right now that represents this and what would I prefer to act like? And that is the bottom line. I again remind you, any big week that you are expressing. Obviously, you also contain the opposite belief. You contain all beliefs. So it is not a matter of anything but which one are you acting upon in that moment, which is always quite obvious when you look at it that way. So do you allow yourself to feel these emotions as they come up? Feel that anxiety. Feel that fear. Feel that insecurity. With no analysis. I will simply sit here and feel it. Then when you get to the end of that process, the analysis will bring information that will assist you. I think I am doing that and then I get resistance to doing it. Well, the resistance generally is in the form of saying, alright, I have had enough back into the closet, where it is then, perhaps you can say, gets quite nourished and comes back quite long. When I arrived last night, I had a dream last night, I woke up screaming out loud. Help me, help me. And I'm going to woke up. And everybody was up and I'm shaking, then it was my dream. I was petrified. Well, obviously you were not petrified. You moved into your mother's house. But the idea is that you were not then willing to look at this idea for a overall fear that it may overcome you. And the only effect that it could overcome you is that notion, not the power inherent in any external sin. But the dream was, I was, had this person with me, this little child or something. And I was trying to haul it and then something lifted me up from the ground. All these other beings were on this island or something and they lived in and they tried to take me. It lifted me up and it petrified me and I just screamed out and woke up. Well, you woke up and then ascribed the symbols as being something happening to you. I again remind you that this small child was you and the beings doing the lifting were you. In that light, what does this represent most obvious? Then I'm being taken care of and lifted to another place. But again, I remind you that you are doing the lifting and the lifting would in no way separate you from the child-like aspects within you. So perhaps to some degree there's also an embodiment of feeling like there still is an external force keeping you from something. It is all wrong. If you have that notion, acknowledge it. That is the only way you can choose something else. Yeah, I was wondering if it was extraterrestrials actually. And I didn't even know I'd be afraid. Well, to some degree you are looking at things that you appear to for not normally viewed and therefore may seem in some ways alien. But that is not precisely in that case, the point is that you have full control. And understanding that when you feel that terror is just as significant as that you are feeling in a toll next time if it ever occurs again, feel it. Allow yourself to feel it. You will not explode. You will not die. You will not weak out of existence in the blink of an eye. You will simply get in touch with a belief that you still express that you no longer desire to express and have assumed has power over you. Your willingness to dive in and feel it will allow you to experience directly that it has no power over you. And it's simply the result of buying into the unpreferred. Therefore, feel it. Allow your heart to in that sense heal in that sense. Right. I did today. I did a long way from the field of instinct. It will not keep returning. It is only when in that sense you panic and head for the hills or in this case mother's dead. That you then create the opportunity to recreate something which again is brand new but may have similar aspects. I have something else. Oh. In part of my sense, I'm doing a workshop in a couple of weeks that I'm very excited about. It has a lot to do with parts of it that we can know that we don't want to come out. So this is obviously very afterpoles that I'm doing this workshop with some demand that I'm dating from Atlanta. And I'm really excited about it. Things are going really well. And I couldn't bring any flyers here or tell anyone. And I forgot. Well, you don't do that. No, I'm not. I was wondering why I didn't. I never do that forget about business things. I'm very, very smart. Well, you can no longer stay back. And you have just made such an announcement. I think those things more into them like that. Maybe I thought I didn't deserve student workshops. Well, do you or don't? Oh, yeah. Well, that is all the reason. You do because you say you do. And any part of yourself quote unquote part or choice within you that says you don't simply say so what away. Now I am being facetious for you. You cannot get read. But the idea is you can choose thereby seeming leaving the other choice for someone. Yes. We will share again. You may all enjoy a short break.
