 All right, I'll say how are you all this evening of your time as you create time to exist? Are you all alive? Thank you very much. Allow us to begin this interaction of the evening of your time with a laying down of a few foundational ideas so that we may have some commonality between us for this interaction. We are, as you have heard, the idea of extraterrestrial. That idea simply means that we too, as yourself, have physical embodiment. We do have a planet upon which we do reside. We do have the idea of similar physicality as yourself, the idea being, we are approximately five feet of your height. Have the idea of one hand, one torso, two arms, two legs similar to yourself. Our skin is white gray in coloration. And our eyes are almond shaped up to that idea. We, if there wasn't an allergy to be drawn to a particular or nationality upon your planet, would be similar, though not exactly to the idea that you would label mandolians. We are a bit, shall we, say more? You men always, in terms of your appearance, then shall we say the alien pictures you have seen recently in your society, particularly that upon. All right, the book you labeled communion. We are a bit more human-like than that idea. We do not insist in any way, shape, or form. That because it is us delivering information to you, that you do need, believe it. No. For we look and view, at all information, at all perspectives, at all points of view, as a gift, which may be freely offered by any individual, but without the idea that it must be in any way, shape, or form, accepted by the recipient. For the idea of gift giving is free. You may accept that if you wish, if it works for you, very good, feel free to use it. If not, I promise you, you will find something else that does. Therefore, again, to capitalize this idea, you do not need to believe anything we are saying, because we are saying it. No. Simply allow things to be tried out in your vernacular. Allow things to be tried on and see what works for you. You may find, if you do have some willingness, to expand your consciousness, to expand yourself, to self and power yourself. That much of the information we will share will be most helpful. However, again, we do not insist in any way that you do, except it is up to you. Similarly, when offering us your gifts, we may choose to accept them, and we may choose to not accept them. However, we assure you, when we do not, we are not invalidating it. For we validate all viewpoints, all realities. We understand the idea that the ultimate truth is composed of all truths. Therefore, all truths are true for those who it is serving at that time. And not that it is this or that. Simply it is this and that, and you do have a choice. Therefore, in that regard, we will proceed with this idea. You know, or have become, shall we say, aware of the idea, that you are reincarnational beings. Very good. This is an understanding that incorporates, shall we say, the idea that you are multidimensional, infinite, and eternal, and simply move from face to face, from scenario to scenario to grow, to experience. Very good. Reincarnational idea, notwithstanding, however, you will only be that you are now one time. You will never be this you. You are again. Therefore, from our perspective, the overall purpose, as many of you constantly ask us about what is my purpose in life, what is my mission in life, is simply to be the best you in any given moment that you can to live your life to the fullest within integrity. For a moment, we shall sidetrack our definition of integrity, is in no way shape or form a moral judgment. It is simply the recognition of integration. The idea that everything is really part and parcel of all one thing anyway. Therefore, by looking at everything around you as a part of yourself, you do not need to force yourself upon another. You do not need to inflict your point of view upon another. You do not need to hurt yourself or others in any circumstance. For that is not a recognition of the integration of all things. Therefore, when we say with integrity, we simply do mean within the recognition of integration of all things. Now, one might ask, all right, I can understand what you are saying. I can understand that being the best me that I can be makes some sense to me. But how do I go about being the best me that I can be? Thank you very much for asking. I will answer. The idea being what you label upon your planet, excitement, has to some degree carried with it many different meanings. Allow us now to expound upon our meaning of excitement. For to us, it is your arrow, your barameros, your way to see what is most you for to us. The idea of excitement can be defined as follows. Excitement, colon. The idea of being that excitement is the physicalized translation of the vibratory energy of the path that you chose to be in this lifetime. Simply put, this is why certain ideas are exciting to you and maybe not to another. What excites you, what allows you to feel attraction for it, love for it, is your indication from what you sometimes label your higher self that this is most you. There are many belief systems and recognize that you do create your own reality through what you believe to be most likely. Your belief systems do create your physical reality, and I mean that literally. Therefore, if you do believe that living a life of your excitement is one of frivolity, is one of, shall we say, hedonism, that is simply a viewpoint. The matter or method of excitement about which we speak is within integrity. Therefore, it will not harm yourself or others. That is part of, shall we say, the criteria to determine whether this is your pure excitement or not. For anxiety is simply excitement. With shall we say, a negative interpretation. Therefore, if you will recognize that your society has ingrained in you from what you call childhood, ideas that live in your excitement is frivolous, you can also recognize that you may change that belief. And you may understand that if you are not hurting yourself or others, if you are simply always being of service to those you interact with, if you are having an exciting time while you are doing it, that is OK. That does not breach any of the ideas that you label frivolity, being frivolous. Therefore, if you will but grant yourself your excitement, first your recognition of what it is that does excite you within the recognition of integrity or integration, you will begin to define what is most you. That is simply the first step. You may recognize and realize that many of you, when determining or establishing your excitement, that you are not doing what excites you in life. All right, simply that recognition may now allow you to begin to initiate that momentum toward what excites you. Allow us now to make another distinction. When we say what excites you, we do in fact mean what excites you the most in your entire life, but not only that idea. For what excites you the most in your entire life may not be, shall we say, immediately available to you. So one may ask, how do I get to this point that seems off in the distance? Oh, right, fair enough. The idea of being that all excitement is one excitement. All excitement is a thread. You are the being that you are one complete being. Therefore, everything that excites you is an expression of that one complete being. And therefore, all your excitement by extension is one thing all interrelated, even though it may not appear that way. Therefore, in order to initiate the momentum of which we speak, one needs simply in any given moment from the choices available for you to do right now. Simply use your excitement within integrity as your criteria, even though it may seem to have nothing to do with the thing that excites you the most. It does. It is integrally related. In fact, it will lead you to the next thing, which will excite you for again, excitement is a thread. What you will find that by following your moment to moment excitement, even though it does not seem to relate to your overall excitement, you acquire the tools, the knowledge, the resources to do the most exciting thing that you cannot do right now. You do this automatically, and you do this anyway. We are simply suggesting that you can't have a very exciting, fun, joyous, aesthetic time doing it. Does not have to be that being an ecstasy, living excitement, having fun, loving life need be an end goal? No. You can't create it that way, and many upon your planet do choose to do so. But it can be the path. That is another choice available to you. That it is the path. If you, shall we say, shoot off into the distance. Searching for that thing, which will finally make you happy, finally make you excited, it takes a long time. And by the time you get there, you don't have much practice being happy, being excited. Simply you may begin now to be excited, to make life the path as well as the destination, although the destination is always changing, always growing, always expanding anyway. Therefore, you may recognize and understand what we are speaking of is self-empowering yourself to create the life, to create the reality you do prefer. We feel that many of you have experienced the idea of creating the reality you do not prefer. Therefore, we are now enabled by your willingness in your mass consciousness. There is enough momentum, enough willingness to take back your power to live your life, to responsibly create your life the way you prefer, that we are able to interact with you. Everything, everything, is composed of vibrations. You are, in a sense, each of vibrations. The difference in your vibration determines the difference in your physical being next. One of you is one person, and you are in particular vibration. Another is another person, and you are in particular vibration. You can only experience the reality that you are the vibration of. Therefore, our vibration is one of unconditional love and life, is one of living life that excites you, is one of a recognition by which anything that occurs in our life is a static and joyful. We only do attract the people, shall we say, globally speaking, into our lives who can serve us the most at any given moment. And we are conscious of this idea. You are another, vibration. However, your vibration has now come to, shall we say, the sufficient frequency to enable us to interact with you for we also can only, only experience the reality. We are the vibration of. So the very ability for us to communicate with you at this timing is your signal, if you choose to look at it that way, that you are becoming of that vibration, that that allowance is there. Otherwise, we could not perceive you. You would be invisible to us. We would be invisible to you. And we would be far too alien to you, and you to us to have meaningful interaction. Such was, in the sense, the state of your math consciousness, but hundreds of your years ago. Therefore, our interaction with your planet, shall we say, is relatively new. But there are many beings out there. There are many planets, many worlds out there, many of which have been in contact with your planet for hundreds and thousands of your years, many of which have interacted in times past and ancient times with your society in a physicalized, blatant way. Some of those are still around. Others are on their way. The reason that we choose at this point to communicate with you in this fashion, rather than face to face, is twofold. First of all, we are of differing vibrations, not to mean this as any better or any worse. For we look at all as equal in one quality that is a quantitative difference, however, in our vibrations. As you do become less physical, as you become more rarefied, your vibration increases. We therefore function, if you will, on a slightly higher vibratory field than you do. When you do bring together a biogenic field of a higher vibration with a biogenic field, such as you may label your aura, your electro-magnetic surrounding field around your body, when you do bring the two in contact, it is like taking two gears, which are spinning at different rates and forcing them together. The higher vibration being represented by a faster turning gear, the lower vibration by a slower turning gear. When you do bring these gears together, shall we say, although the effect to some degree will be to slow down the faster turning gear, the far greater effect, is to accelerate very quickly the slower turning gear, and how this translates in your reality is, shall we say, a bit tumultuous. For we operate and function as 100% whole beings. You, on the other hand, have chosen, and we are not denigrating this idea, simply pointing it out, to, in a sense, chop yourself up in two parts and hide parts from each other. You have created, shall we say, convenient compartments to hide them in. You're subconscious. You're super conscious. You're unconscious. And this idea, when your vibration is, shall we say, forced to a higher level, the things that you have shut down within your shall we say, subconscious closet, do rush all of a sudden to the surface. And many of you fear looking at these things. This is why these closets were created, in a sense, to begin with. Therefore, the effect that we have noticed, when beings of your planet do interact with various extraterrestrial beings, is what you may label psychotic, shock, a intense, fear, reaction. And we have no desire in any way, shape, or form, to elicit this reaction from you. So that would be, shall we say, reason number one. Reason number two is that we do view all forms and expressions of consciousness from the lowest vibratory nature to the highest vibratory nature as equal. Therefore, we can only, in a sense, communicate with you in a blatant physicalized manner when you will view us as equal. At this time, many of you do place us above you. All right? We are not. Nor do we desire to be. We have all the power we need to create our own reality. And we don't need any of yours. You don't need any of anybody else's. You all have your own power. Therefore, we have noticed in your society, a penchant, a propensity. Two, shall we say, pay more attention to the messenger than the message to fall down on your knees and bow. And this is not our desire. Our desire is to communicate with you as equal, as individuals face to face, eye to eye. And when you are willing, by your own selves, to begin to integrate these portions of yourself that you have hidden, colloquially speaking, you then integrate as a being. You are always 100% a 100% being. But we have noticed upon your planet that many individuals use 90% of that power to make it seem as though they are only using 10, very creative. However, you are 100% being. And when you will see that whatever is in your experience, your reality serves you, allows you to integrate these buried ideas, then you will begin to use what you already have to integrate yourself. Before we do open this international up to sharing or questions and answers or statements, one moment, allow me to make the following illustration. What you label negative emotionality, which many of you in your vernacular bum out about when it happens, is one of the main keys to integration. If you will but see this, you will take what you have labeled your weaknesses and make them your strengths for the way that consciousness breaks itself down from all that is, or God, as you call it, is in the following steps. Existence is, in a sense, all that is. All that is exists is simply is. The first separation is the idea of knowingness. The next separation is the idea of belief system. The next, shall we say, following step is emotion. And the last is thought patterns. Your emotions are simply reaction to your beliefs, the ones next up on the scale. Therefore, any emotion that you do have is simply a reaction to a belief that you have. In order to change your belief, you must own it. You must know what it is. You must be willing to admit it to yourself. Therefore, when you experience what you label negative emotionality, simply realize that any emotion comes from a belief. Allow yourself to assess in an honest fashion what must I believe to be feeling this way. If you are honest, you will mail down the belief that is owning it. Then you can change it. Therefore, as you do change the beliefs, which you have allowed to be ingrained within you to the beliefs which allow you to live a life you prefer by convention you integrate. By convention, the things you have hidden come up. You look at them. You can only create a reality that you can handle. You cannot create any reality that you cannot handle by definition. If you are creating it, you are prepared to handle it. Therefore, use your negative quote, unquote, emotionality to allow you to hone in on the belief which no longer serves you. If you will, but do so, the integrative process will be very swift. For we have used the rubber band analogy upon your planet. One of the things that you are exploring is extreme negativity. The other thing you are exploring is positivity. And the third, shall we say, exploration is the integration of both. You have, however, lean, shall we say, a little bit towards the negative in your society. Right now, the vestiges of that negativity are bubbling up within the face of your planet. They will have very different outcomes than they have in your past. This will be the signpost that this is the transitional wage. However, recognize this idea. If you pull your rubber band very tight and consider that this is negativity, when you let it go, it does swing far and fast into the positive. And that is, by definition, the accelerative effect of the transformational age. So therefore, the negativity you are experiencing is simply, in a sense, the pulling of the rubber band. When the rubber band is released, it does not take much time. It is a very accelerated travel to the other extreme of positivity. And this is the transformation that your planet is now going through, what you may label, the new age. This is a unique time upon your planet. This is a time whereby you can integrate in one single lifetime. That is another reason we are able to communicate with you at this time. So for your willingness to co-create with us in this manner, for your willingness to explore that you just might create your own reality, for your willingness to be open-minded enough to look at the possibilities of other whole worlds, other whole society, other whole civilizations. I do thank you and ask you now how may I be of service to you? Sharing. Yes. Good day, Bishar. As are you. A lot of things have gone through my mind, so if I can catch on one. All right. You were talking about thousands of years ago, extraterrestrial being on this planet and helping out with the people on this planet at that time. In a sense, more intermingling, less of the idea of helping. Again, you did not need help. Simply cooperation. So what happened to that idea of empowerment within that expansive blue up and malaria, blue up and? Thank you very much. The idea is those were the explorations of limitation, of negativity, of imposing upon yourselves of forgetfulness that you already are, God, already are, part of all that is. And that was, shall we say, the reason for these explorations. This is, that was the beginning of the cycle of limitation. Approximately 25,000 of your years that is now culminating at this time. Percy. So why wouldn't we do it again? I mean, if we. Our perception is that you are not doing it again. That this is your chance to step up to the same precipice and not step over, you are reintegrating, you are transforming from third density viewpoint to fourth density, slightly more rarefied, still physical, more living the idea of understanding that you create your own reality and you, in fact, are your own reality. So when we become into this fourth density, where we love the earth, we continue to be on the earth and create the earth as a loving environment so that we'll be flowing. There will be people on it who we say as we look today. Yes, just on the grid. As you do in the sense, move on. Appearances may change for various purposes. Appearances are always to serve purposes anyway. It's not that there is a strict evolution, as you know it, to that consciousness does embark upon particular explorations and the vehicles or vessels are created for those explorations. Does that help? Yes. OK, we'll just go into another question. All right. On your planet, you dance. In a sense, you may say that there are fluid movements of the body and synchronize the chord with certain tonality, but not in the rigidized fashion of which you speak. We do not have our version of the Lindy, for instance. But there are spontaneous, shall we say, expressions through the bodily form from time to time. And it would be more of that idea for things in our society are quite spontaneous. We do not plan ahead. We are here now always, eternal, what other time is there, but here and now. So you don't think into tomorrow? No. How do you create? How do you create? It just happens? We simply move along spontaneously, drawing and attracting to ourselves whatever it is that we need to continue to do what excites us. Again, we live by excitement all the time, simply that we have 100% trust, not the shadow of a doubt, ever about anything. The idea of doubt in and of itself, which is simply shifted trust, by the way, not a lack of trust, was one of the more alien concepts to us that we needed to understand in order to communicate with you. It is so foreign to our daily way of being. We do not doubt. We always have 100% trust in the reality. We are creating in any given moment. Let that help. Thank you very much, Sharon. Yes. Along those lines of the first question, could you describe the earth that is your present time, your present time? Thank you very much. Only in a loose sense. For again, it is one of the possible futures for you, and we do not in a sense want to open that present before you get to it. But the idea being that the earth that exists in our contemporary timing, our current earth, is one that has achieved much of similarity to our civilization. You are living in love and light, in cooperation. That is one world in a sense, people, without the need for government. And you do, in a sense, interact with many civilizations and are an integral part of the association of worlds, which simply is, for those of you who are new to this idea, a network of many civilizations that have come together in peace, in love and cooperation to, in a sense, network information. Share ideas, expand exploration of the known multiverse. Does that answer the question? Yes. All right. Don't need to be vague, but do not worry. You'll be there. Yes. Yes. Thank you very much. Sharing. Yes. Can you enlarge the better or expand a little bit towards their polarities? North Pole, South Pole, East West, and our understanding of the vibration relating to it, and how to expand them and capitalize on them like gravity or manatees, manate like Northern South, how to become more attuned into it to be able to use more for the gusamain kind and also bodies and our life of this time. Thank you very much. What a creative question. The idea being this. Your planetary body. In a sense is a magnet, but not quite in the way that you understand magnets for its function of having a electromagnetic effect is a result of its spin. Your Earth has also, aside from simply an atmosphere, an electromagnetic speed surrounding it. It does vibrate it approximately, approximately the frequency you would label seven and one half cycles per second. It is a moving fluid in that sense and crosses at many places. There are individuals in your history who have understood that this idea could be capped and in a sense it can. Simply the idea of your electricity is produced from the idea of magnetic field, tapping magnetic field. When running electricity through a coil, magnetism is what does result. When running a magnet through a coil, electricity does result because they are one and the same idea. And if you could in a sense fashion a coil and using what is available now upon your planet, your literature determines the rate and flow of the electromagnetic field around your planet. Positioning that coil in such a way you could in a sense generate electricity from this idea. And in fact this has in a sense been done in your society. Simply that the information was suppressed. But this is available to individuals. One individual that we can point you more in researching many of these ideas who are successful in many of these ideas is the individual you label, Nikolai Tesla. Are you aware of that individual? Yes. We suggest looking toward that source for the patents as you say exist and much of this technology is free for you to examine if you will but see that it is there. Does that answer the question? Yes. In a general way. I was an individual. I personally assume my vibratory level to be able to tap more and by me I mean myself and others who are interested in doing that into the vibrations of that source of knowledge. Now understand that personally you can do this at any time. By simply surrounding yourself with whatever symbol is strong to you whether it be white, one of the symbologies, representations of white shall we say for your planetary influences blue, white, white. If you will surround yourself in a sense in your mentality for your imagination is very real as far as we are concerned. You can by pulsing the rate of the Earth's electromagnetic frequency through the contents of this white line yourself up in a sense with the idea of your appliances. In that aligned state the idea that you label this ease cannot exist. Does that more get to the part of the matter? Are you talking about Tesla ultraviolet light for our light light today which emanates more of the sun rays vibration. It's like a blue light that you're talking about. We are talking about shall we say the effect of your planet from space. It is no coincidence that it is blue, white and appearance. And this is shall we say a representational symbol of your planet, of the electromagnetic sea of your planet. So it is not the ideas that you spoke of and more of the idea that I am mentioning. But it is simply symbolic and whatever will work for you will work for you. Simply there is a difference between our approach to imagination and your society's approach to imagination. We validate our imagination as real. Therefore we get the effect that our imagination is real. Your imagination can also be real and you can use it in any way, shape or form you see fit to create whatever reality you do prefer. Therefore you can simply visualize this idea and get the effect just as real as if you had done it physically. Thank you very much. If indeed you would require some specification simply react and we will provide. Thank you very much. Shanny. Sure I want to get a specific comment in that white light with at 7.5, 7.5, size is the size if you just imagine your vibrating at that. At that level. I mean you don't have to do anything on it as you use your imagination. There are many ideas you can incorporate. If you need a visual aid you can get your strobe light instead of at 7.5 to get the idea of the beat frequency. If you have your idea that you label a vibration machine that can actually tailor the vibration to a particular frequency you can in a sense see what that frequency sounds like. You mean like the machine and the reason you do not mean relaxing in your mouth. In a sense you could use that idea as a cue but we were meaning more readily available to everybody. In a sense you are simply lining up with it. You are not in a real sense vibrating at it. Okay. But you are identifying with it and in a sense being added. Okay. All right. I got that. Thank you very much. I got it. I can, while you were talking something else, I'm going to ask. How can you use the quartz crystals and colors to amplify and tap into creating and understanding and using this vibratory level that we're just discussing at this time. In absolutely any way you wish. This is what I mean by imagination. If you will but answer that question for me with conviction you will have your answer. For recognizing that your scientists even now are beginning to realize matter and energy are one thing. Therefore your quartz crystal in a sense is simply crystal and energy. If you view it that way you may focus your mentality through it. You may use it in any way shape or form that your imagination will come up with. And using the tool of your imagination can be very helpful in your reality. May I give another example of the use of imagination. Thank you very much. If there is a person you desire to be. If you will but use your imagination in this way you can create that reality now. And this is how and it is very simple. Simply picture in your imagination. Come your up the image of the individual you wish to be. Now observe what are they doing. How do they carry on? What do they do when they get out of bed? What do they eat for breakfast? How do they react or act when people interact with them? How do they respond in any gift? Scientists even now are beginning to realize matter and energy are one thing. Therefore your quartz crystal in a sense is simply crystal and energy. If you view it that way you may focus your mentality through it. You may use it in any way shape or form that your imagination will come up with. And using the tool of your imagination can be very helpful in your reality. May I give another example of the use of imagination. Thank you very much. If there is a person you desire to be. If you will but use your imagination in this way you can create that reality now. And this is how and it is very simple. Simply picture in your imagination. Come your up the image of the individual you wish to be. Now observe what are they doing. How do they carry on? What do they do when they get out of bed? What do they eat for breakfast? How do they react or act when people interact with them? How do they respond in any gift? But here is the key. When you have conjured up this image, when you have imbued it with as many details as you can find, you only need to do one thing to be that person. Act that way. And this is what we label one of the most positive uses of the tool of your imagination. Therefore you can do this at any time. By acting that way you become that vibration you shall, if they skip a few steps. And you cannot experience anything but that reality. Therefore you may use your imagination if you will but validate what you get in very creative ways. Also when you label your sleeping dream reality from our perspective is no less real than this waking dream reality. You are dreaming right now. Wake up and live the dream. Understand when you are in that other sleeping dream you are also living real experiences. Thank you very much. Shana. When you experience us when we talk to you, do you see us as an energy? Do you recognize each time we speak to you as that energy? Recognize that in each and every new given moment you are a different person. But we understand what you mean then? Yes. You are able to recognize and assess energies that we have interacted with. I have a question regarding the Tesla idea. How much? I think it cannot leave my mind. What you were saying before and studying the person and the same the person, imitating the person and becoming the person. If the person is no longer alive. We do not necessarily mean a particular person. If we picture yourself already there, already being who you desire to be. Not another person, you. And then act that way. You will immediately have that reality for you to refuse to see anything else. But that reality, if you do it 100%. How right? Thank you. You seem a bit hesitant about that one. You who had very fast-paced and you were right on. So it took me a nice bite. Oh, thank you very much. Always willing to surprise you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Shana. Yes, you. I have a question about, and obviously timing is part of what our planet is into. And not universal knowing this is. But my understanding is there's been a lot of discussion among the second communities of late about the issue that the planet Earth in its transformational process will literally change totally within like a five to ten year timeframe now such that people who are on their path and are enlightened in any way would actually be physically beamed up, if you will, by extraterrestrials. And that is not the idea of our perception. However, any reality of grand validity to will be a lived out reality. Our idea, first of all, is that what you are saying is true. From our perspective, we can see your world as one world. By your year approximately 2011, 2013, not exactly five or ten, but close. However, we do not again see the need to save anyone. No one is drowning. Everyone is self-intowered now. It's simply that they are not willing to recognize that and act that way. One by one, you are waking up. As you do, there is another phenomenon known as your mass consciousness. It is in the sense of representation of all of you. It is what authors, as each one of you in a sense, wakes up and wins the dream. And as more individuals do, there is a greater momentum in the mass consciousness. It is our sensing of the state of your mass consciousness at this timing which allows us to communicate. So, not shall we say positivity in there and it is gaining momentum, particularly with what you label the tumultuous situation upon your planet at this timing. Much integration is occurring. It is quite different from our observation than your past wars. Maybe not looking at it in your television set. Maybe not comparing it to your other wars, but in an overall sense from our perspective, quite different. What I am speaking of along those lines is that the Earth would become un-in-tavital as the empaticable. One way before you proceed, do you understand the idea of parallel realities? Yes. The idea is that all realities are real. You cannot imagine non-existence. Go ahead and try. But the idea of being all realities are real somewhere. In a sense, there is no one future. There is an unlimited amount of parallel futures. Which one do you desire? Which one do you choose? There are Earth in a sense constantly breaking off parallel Earth. And this is all literal. Understand, there is an Earth. That will explode in a sense. But it is not what we perceive to be the Earth that you are on. You can change that at any time. We suggest you do not. No. Alright, and then in a general way, do you have any specific guidance that you think would be most important for me to hear? Yes, thank you very much. Any, did in moments do what excites you the most. What has become a standard question in these interactions? Are you doing in your life right now what excites you the most? Yes, and I'm moving towards the ultimate exercise. Then you are doing everything you need to do to exhibit love, light, service and positivity. You are vibrating at that rate and can only experience that reality. Now simply do not allow any evidence that comes in from without to tell you anything else. Simply glean the most positive thing from anything that comes into your reality. That is 100% positive drug. Can I ask one last answer? Alright, no one. It has to do with the creation of peace by feeling peace within. You have spoken about that in probably many states. The idea is being peace will then have you acting as though you are a peaceful being. Then you will vibrate as a peaceful being and can only experience a peaceful reality. Is it from your perspective such that people on the earth plane now will be able to vibrate in their own peaceful perspective such that we won't see this war continuing and the playing of it? The specifics of the playing out of the scenario in a sense are irrelevant to all these ideas. The playing out of the war. It will allow individuals to view many things, to look at many issues. And if you will but use the inner sense as service in that regard to allow you to see where you stand compared to it, then in a sense in the most way that it can be, you will allow it even to be a service to you. Anything can be a service to you. By proceeding again as a living example of that which you speak gives you the greatest opportunity to attract others around you who also desire such a reality. And you will find in a sense small communities forming of these types of individuals. Does that assist you? Yes, it does. Thank you very much. Over there. Good night. Good night. I have a couple questions. My first one is Nikolai Tess was named comes up a lot in the case that I've heard about the session. My husband has a business partner, his name is Tesslyn. He is the great nephew of Nikolai Tess was. His son and my son are very different, best friends. The boy's name is Buddy Tesslyn. Buddy goes to a technical school in the area and coincidentally he's taken up electronics. He was at our house a few weeks ago and talking about what he's going to do with this electronics field. He has no feel for it and doesn't excite him. So I sat there and asked him what did excite him. And his answer just knocks me for a little piece that he would like to talk with extraterrestrials, with people in space. He would like to go into space and deal with that sort of thing. And he said don't think I'm crazy but that's what I want to do. So I didn't know what to tell him. I just told him there's a lot of information in the library from which you go and look it up. But I was wondering what you think I should talk to him about this. Did we again, to the degree that you are willing, make any individual aware of what you know. It is no coincidence that you are interacting with them in this manner. Do you think that you are willing to provide what you feel comfortable in providing and love and love and love and service? Do you think that you are willing to recognize that he has attracted you into his reality. Express, coincidentally, these ideas to you. You may now in a sense pick up the ball and rum with it if you choose. Do you think inviting him to a session like this for a 17 year old boy would be a good idea? It's up to you. I cannot tell you that. How do you feel about it? We will speak if he is pleasant. Okay. And recognize this is really very easy to do. The individual before you had no thoughts about doing this till it happened. Went through no formalized process. Didn't learn to channel. Shall we say we helped them along with it? And this is available. Our particular stream of consciousness is available to anyone who is excited by it. I think the body would be very excited by it. But I have these editions of me going home and telling this parent to the senator. Oh, what are these fucking things? I resent that these are many of the real issues you are exploring. Therefore, exploring and recognize the degree to which you are willing to be, the true reflection of who you are. Remember, what are your clear intentions? They are simply loving. Therefore, that is your innocence indicator. Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much. I have one more. Oh, right. And? I think so. Okay. I've heard recently, my sister told me that she saw a show on Sudea's Walk show where I don't know who it was. I was thinking about Bill Cooper. Thank you. We said that President Kennedy years ago was fascinated because he knew about extraterrestrial treasure. Could he help you help me out here? One moment. You need not to continue. We shall think we have to live this way and we do not mean to be nebulous. No comment on the specifics, however, our perception, our perception is shall we say that that individual is a bit confused and has a bit exaggerated and that is all we shall say. Therefore, you may look at these ideas, decide where you stand to them, allow them as any other reality to be valid. And if you do not prefer it, do not perpetuate it. Do not buy into it. Do not, in a sense, come up against it. Allow it. Remember the difference between discernment and judgment. The sermon is establishing your preference. Judgment is invalidating that which you do not prefer. Simply validate it. If you do not prefer it, do not feed it any energy, any momentum. With the reality, you prefer. Do you prefer that reality? I would just like the world to know at some point exactly why he was murdered. Why did you confess to me? Oh right. And to some degree this idea will come to life. But not yet. Not yet? Okay. It is well known by many individuals why that is all we shall say. Have President Kennedy reincarnated or Martin Luther King? One moment. Although it is rare that this is so, we all not in the sense allowed to share the idea of Kennedy. However, the idea of King is now representing, shall we say, an archetypal energy that is infused within the electromagnetic field of the other planet. In all shall we say, Matt consciousness idea as a symbol for unconditional love, life, active, loving interaction. And in the sense that is not re-individualized at this time, although that is available to that spirit. And that is all we shall share. Thank you very much. I have a question. To my lifetime at this time, at one point I was in conscious of the light and dark side. I just lived day by day and it was one way. And then at another point I shift totally towards wanting to be on the all light side, creating another dis-balance on the other side. And then being conscious of the darker side, trying to work in balance with two of them, and still juggling the balls in the air and creating that balance between the light and the dark to maintain a balance in being. Do you have any suggestions or any ideas you would like to share without this time? Yes, and thank you very much again for the opportunity to share these ideas. Understand that there is what you label positive. To us positive energy is simply integrative energy. And there is negative, which we label, separated. We stay away from the terms right and wrong. They are arbitrary. But the idea is integrated, separated, positive, negative. It is perfectly okay to be aware of both. But you only need manifest that, which you shall we say will put some energy behind. Therefore, as you expand, you will become infinitely more aware of positive, infinitely more aware of negative. But if you will recognize but one single point and one single point only, you can always, always, then he say always. I think he said always. Manifest, experience, the positive, and that is this idea. Everything that occurs, everything, no exception, is fundamentally neutral. Blank, zero, this, as you say. A, set of trust, everything. You provide the meaning. The meaning you provide determines the effects you get. Positive effect in, positive effect out. Negative meaning is, negative meaning out. Becoming aware of something is all well and good. How you choose to interpret it with how it fits in your life, however, is your choice. So by simply in any given situation, allowing yourself to neutralize a view, giving yourself the opportunity to at least see that it is neutral, and it is most obvious what is negative, you can then put some, shall we say, attention on the idea of cleaning what is positive. And by doing this, you begin to only get positive effects. So in a sense, you only need manifest positive and maybe aware of negative, but that allows you to further define yourself, and it's not in, of itself, a negative. Does that answer the question? I'll run. Trust me. Fish time. One more? I just want to press a little bit. You know, like the in and the end, it's the in and the end. And the circle, the black side and the white side, if they need to blend to be able to create the harmony. In a sense, what we are speaking of is the neutralization of that idea. The balancing of the energy, and then creating what you prefer. Trust me. So, you don't have to be on one particular side, you can be on both sides. No, you can be aware of both sides. It always manifests the white side. You can. In. Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much. At this time, we will pause for a short break and resume contact in 10 to 15 of your life.
