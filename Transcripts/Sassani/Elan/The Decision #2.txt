 All right, I'll say one moment. The entitlement for this evening's interaction will simply be the decision. Before we proceed, allow me to simply make a simple distinction which we have shared before and you will find quite helpful. It is along the lines of what we have already discussed in terms of maintaining the decision for who it is you prefer to be, and in mentioning that you already do this anyway, that your reality is already the result of any decision that you make. And this is nothing new to you. The same thing very directly applies to trust. Now as we have said, you decide who you are, you make the decision. Then you trust that decision, then you act as though you trust that decision and voila, linear reality result. In terms of trusting the decision, understand in no uncertain terms what you call faith, what you call trust, which is perhaps slightly more intentional than faith, is not something that you need to gain. Trust is not something you need to muster up. The reason being because you already trust 100% even if it is in a reality that you do not prefer. So you do contain it all and in containing all of it, you always already trust in something. So you do not need to gain trust but simply be aware that you always trust in something and be more conscious and purposeful about what you will choose to trust in. Trust is something you always have. You are always placing it somewhere. You can remind yourself, well look where I am placing my trust, but in a sense that is looking backward. You can also simply just say alright, I understand, I had negative decision, I had negative trust. This is my decision and since I will trust in something, why not the decision? So with that distinction and on that note, we will continue with the sharing. Shilling. I had an experience recently with the dolphins. So how exciting, do share? Well the other sentient species upon your planet in the way that you define sentience. Do proceed. Well I just enjoyed it very much. I was wondering what your thoughts were about dolphins actually. Well in a sense your planet is quite fortunate from one way of looking at it in that the first extraterrestrial species that you have interacted with is actually intra-terrestrial. Humans are very very similar in style of sentience as what you call Q-Map. And therefore although they have many differences, are intelligent self-reflective thinking conscious being. And your willingness to begin to expand your particular definition of who you are to allow for more and more and more experience of different aspects of yourself, whether they be similar or quite different, often will begin with the advantage of you have, that you have as a society of having that species in your own backyard. So it is very exciting and invariably individuals who seek out and express that experience do so out of an innate willingness to begin to expand your definition of yourself, of your reality, of your experiential universe. So how was it? It was one of the best experiences in my life that was terrific. What did you enjoy about it? What did you find most enjoyable and agreeable about it? Well I just connected with them in a very emotional way. I felt part of them, they felt part of me. We were playing, we were playful and joyful and just being. Oh right, now that you have added to your roster of options this particular approach, do you plan or have you begun to express that in your daily life? Understanding that the experience came from you with the reflection of the external being but truly 100% from you and being that you find that most agreeable, most exciting. Are you willing to begin to apply it to what you call your fellow human? I try every day but I must admit that some days is part of another scene. Oh right, well, trying. All the trying is not the doing of the thing but merely the doing of trying which is one step removed from being completely committed. So perhaps when you are defining yourself, when you are establishing the decision that you can then refine that decision to simply be willing to seek out and experience that type of communion with everyone that you see no matter what their response may be. That's very good. Oh, you're full, what? It's quite neutral to me but I understand what you mean. It is the positive perspective that you contain. However, you only created that experience with your inherent ability to create that experience. And what I am suggesting is that rather than trying to do that with everyone else around and flying, that it will be quite difficult and probably not work, you can simply understand now that I know what this feels like, my decision is this is how I choose to relate to other individuals, period, no matter what they say. For what you will notice is that the dolphin consciousness as you interacted with it was quite unconditional toward you. And though it appeared to perhaps that you were experiencing that from them truly the only way you experienced anything is to create your version of it. So it was you, your energy and that energy is available any time. How exciting. Extremely exciting. Thank you. All right. Dive into your reality. If you wish, we will never force you to have too much fun or enjoy yourself too much. Do proceed. Shutting. As long as we're on the subject of enjoyment, when you come here to do this, this is very enjoyable for us. Are you experiencing that also? Do you sense love and enjoyment back at you? Absolutely. I create my version of it which could appear when looking at my reality in linear terms to be loved from you. Now understand, in my decision of who I am, there is no lack of self love. I completely 100% love myself and others and reality and circumstance 100% with the complete trust that I created and its very existence is to support my experience. Though when I interact with you, I can create that awareness. And so what you would perceive as your emotion toward me, I create my version of and have an experience. And I am simply explaining the mechanics. In other words, the long winded answer to your question is yes. With a little explanation. Understand one other thing if you wish. Whatever you perceive that you get out of this, I get just as much out of it. I understand in no uncertain terms that you all exist within me. And as I am willing to interact with different aspects of my own consciousness through seeming external others, I then learn more about myself. My particular society's approach is different than your own. And we are not exploring the types of limitations that you will often choose to explore. Therefore, we do not generally interact with that aspect of ourselves on a daily basis. Interacting with your society affords me the opportunity to begin to look at some of those ideas, although always do I do so from my empowered self. What I am getting at is that the favor that you are doing from my end to me is immeasurable. And it allows me to understand myself on a very complete level apart from the mass general experience of my society. My society also happens to be very interlinked. And I will say tell empathically as opposed to tell a pathically. For empathy implies that you create your version, experience your version. But you can in that sense mold your version so closely to the intention of the seeming others that it seems that you are reading their mind. It seems that you are in touch. What technically is going on is we are creating the same thoughts at the same time. And therefore anything that is to my awareness for anyone in my society who is so inclined, they too immediately have that experience and interact with it from their particular individual point of view to reflect back to themselves as well. So not only do I get something out of this, but so do the many members of my society who are so focused in that type of self-expression. And we thank you. Shouting. Perhaps you. Perhaps you. Thank you for that. Sharing this gift really enjoys that answer. Oh right. I thank you for enjoying it and creating the enjoyment. So I think in this room for an hour and I think sensing the show up the whole time. I see him in my mind's eyes that reclining in a chat. I guess I would like some validation or I'm just wondering where he is. Will you allow me to use your language liberally? Where buddy? With you right now. At this particular time there are several individuals present. He is one. He is by the way, very busy. All the time. Can barely nail him down to use your binoculars. Fortunately, we always are in touch. Tell me what you did with your day today. And this particular day I have done several things. One was I involved myself in a energy exchange with other individuals of my planet. Because very loosely speaking, perhaps what you would simply refer to as having a game of catch with a bowl of energy. That is a very loose interpretation for now for the imagery that it will allow you to create it will do. I also have in that sense interacted within my spacecraft in taking certain readings from what you would call other various individual society that we are communicating with at this time. And then you. Thank you. I just think I'm real interested in the Lithuanian civilization. And I'm understanding that they are human for like we are. And I'm enjoying their perspective on life which is very empowering. I guess that I feel like when I need to be empowered when I'm not being my essence, I will put a tape in a few guys or think I'm a bot of the Canadian and I just wanted to say that I'm sharing, I'm becoming more aware of who I am and my spirituality and I'm having fun with it. I'm so grateful, right? I thank you for your willingness to share that and understand your galactic family is quite intact and on that level you are already creating interaction with them. You will notice earlier that I said that we will not interact with you in a way that would be a disservice to you or seem to imply that you are disempowered. And that is one of the reasons for what you call channeling phenomena. It allows us in a very seemingly removed way to communicate with you and still allow you to make your own decisions, still allow you to have your own choices, still allow you to create either your trust or place that trust in the form of what you refer to as doubt. Therefore, it is still completely enough for you to believe that I am who I say I am, I in no way have any insistence that you do. But if you are to you are beginning to become more familiar with your galactic family and we thank you. Thank you very much. Hey, Nail, Wednesday night. I assume you knew I was here. Oh, what? If that is your decision, I will abide. Since I have been able to ask you, where are you and in a sense Tracy already asked that, but might you be on your mother's ship for a change? Well, I might be, but I'm not. At this particular moment, I am upon the face of what you would refer to as my climate. Oh, you're actually there. Not in your spacecraft. That's unusual. Not really. What you refer to as projection table, and again, this is very loose, also occur upon the planet from time to time, though perhaps you would refer to them as, and I mean this quite loosely, portable tables. I get the ideas that roughly 70% of your population, 250 million total, might normally be off the planet. From time to time, this is the case. This will vary. It has recently been, for lack of a better translation, a celebration. Simply that many of us are finding ourselves physically proximal to each other or on the planet at the same time. And while we're there, all right, I will use your language once again. This does not quite translate. We like to party. Now the reason that it does not translate is because our entire attitude and life has that type of allowance in it. So there is not the distinction, I am partying now, now I am not. We are always in that sense expressing joy and ecstasy, which one way to interpret into your language is party. Dancing, singing, music? Not in the way that you understand, but perhaps a version of that from time to time will spontaneously arise as does everything that we do. This is why I hesitate to call that a celebration. It is not that formal and quite spontaneous. Let me switch over to, I understand the law of attraction, likes, attract, likes. The reason I bring this up within the last several months. By the way, what you put out is what you get back. And in that sense, likes will seem to attract likes. But you attract everything that will support your decision. And certain things will be in sync or alike your decision to allow you to see, this is me, here's a reflection of me. But you also, in that you are still linear and utilize this tool, generally also surround yourself with examples of things that you are not to stand out and relief. Now as you begin to more consciously and purposefully maintain your decision in a positive way, your statement like attracts like will seem to be more accurate. Or you will no longer define yourself with so many examples of what you are not to remind yourself of who you are. The moment I'm talking about people attracting people and more specifically within the last few months, Tracy and I have come together with very close loving friendship. And so I understand, I guess, why that would be the case. But more specifically, could you say anything about maybe our history in past life being at all special words that we knew each other, anything at all you can add would be all right. You have in that sense had past life experience together, period. I will allow you through your own sense of discernment and through your own sense of excitement to understand and create your version of what that means. But in that sense, you need not ask me for that type of validation and they understand that your feelings are trustworthy. Your vibrational understanding is accurate. And also many individuals loosely speaking in your so-called group are beginning to mutually support each other in understanding that as you co-create your reality according to your passion and excitement with integrity in a positive way, it's fun to have friends around. Well, that feeling of loving family has definitely been growing for things to be noticeably in the last several months. You will find all others in this room have a similar version of that idea. And as you are willing to establish who you are, your relationships with others will also clarify as well. And as you are unwilling to commit to the decision of who you are or continuously alter and change the decision of who you are, that uncertainty, that ill-defined perception also then becomes superimposed upon your relationships. Let me add on one last question that has to do with my favorite subject. I know you're all of reluctant to predict the future, but two or three years ago you answered this question, reading the energies that impact on my water fuel cell question that is so exciting to me. Are you willing tonight to look at the energies and see when that product might hit the marketplace finally? No. Okay. I am going to- Allow me to ask you a question. What was your perception? What is the wording? Of my answer, last time you asked that question. As best I can recall, it's like three to five years that you said it might welcome to reality. Oh. And that's been like two and a half years ago, roughly. Oh. Perhaps I will revise then my answer to say that that is approximately accurate according to right now. However, there is something in what you call the works that can alter that and delay it. And again, I will not be more specific than that for specific reasons, but you will find out simply do your research and again understand all potential futures are equally valid and there is no one the future until you decide that there is. I will ponder your answer. Thank you very much. Thank you. I thank you as well for your willingness to put yourself out and take yourself back. Sir, I wanted to know if you would share more with us about the civilization you've been communicating with today. All right. The civilization that I was taking the aforementioned readings on do not express themselves quite in the physical terms that you are accustomed to. They are perhaps you can say energy beings that still have the ability to express physical manifestations. Those physical manifestations are instantaneous and instantaneously responsive to the slightest change in consciousness. So our perception of them occurs through the idea of the physical manifestations and we are able to directly interact with them what you call teleempathically, but we can also communicate to them through what you call observation by simply taking a measurement or a reading or an observation of their particular physical manifestation along what you would refer to as a linear timeline. We can translate by interpretation of the physical symbols their intended message and it is an interesting perhaps you can say game that we play. Did this translate at all? Yeah, it did. By the way, there are many beings like this, but this particular society we are in proximity to and they are also perhaps you can say from their point of view taking in and relishing certain approaches that our society have as well. In fact, some of the physical manifestations that they have in effect manifested are temporarily similar bodies to our own, but only for fleeting moments. In other words, they are trying us on so to speak. Does that make sense? Okay, so they are creating body forms as one of the forms. They are spontaneously and generally fleeting, very quick. Now one way that we can communicate back to them along those lines, we are not automatically directly linked what you would call teleempathically, although that is not particularly accurate, I will not go into the details. We can also create energy manifesting as physical events and have a conversation from one set of physical events that they are creating to another set of physical manifestations and results that we are creating and I in that sense was functioning perhaps you can say very loosely speaking as secretary for the event. Does that make sense? Yes, cool. Oh, actually it is quite temperate. Okay. All right. Is there anything else? No. All right. Is there anyone else who would like to share? Yes. Um, you being a mirror images to me as I am to you? I'm really happy about that. Well, so am I. They are really like that. Well, I thank you for honoring yourself so completely. I have a question, um, this might be too much of a personal question. I hope not for the crowd. We trust the synchronicity of whatever we attract and when you are all willing to also entertain that idea, simply nothing will be extraneous in your reality. Do proceed with the trust that the timing is impeccable. Thank you. I am in the process of wanting a divorce for my husband. Um, without a condition and I'm having a hard time with that because I'm not giving him a reason and that's not acceptable to him. Would you in a similar circumstance desire a reason? Well, I know, see, I'm looking at it as though he is an aspect of me and it's like- Oh, and before you proceed, answer my question. Where the shoe to be on the other foot would you desire a reason? Well, yeah, I guess. Why? Well, I did. I mean, it should be obvious, I guess. Well, so that you can grow and learn from the experience, yes? What is your reason for depriving him of that opportunity? As far as explaining to him. So that he may learn and grow or do whatever. Your responsibility is simply to make the communication not to be responsible for his reaction. But why do you assume that he has attracted such a situation that he cannot handle? Because he won't acknowledge when I say that I want a divorce or to leave. What I just- I basically say, it's just not bringing me joy and we're not- we don't ever do anything together and there's no supporting of each other. It's just, I don't know. Oh, what will you do? Well I don't want to- I'm so stagnant and it's not bringing me joy and I know that that's not certain that it may be or yes. Ironically, being indecisive, technically speaking, is a decision. Right. Is a decision. Which is distinct from not making a decision and making that. I was going more on the one thing, I guess. I was focusing on the joy in wanting to take the action, not the decision. So it's the decision that comes before the one thing? Not necessarily, but assuming that the one thing has already been forthcoming, the decision would be next. And in fact again, you have made a decision to remain stagnant. Yeah, I don't want to. Oh, well you tried that one on. Now what will you do? Make a decision. Oh wow. Congratulations. You have transformed your reality spontaneously and completely. How does it feel? Great. Oh, thank you. I simply suggest that no matter what you do, and I would not advise you as to one specific idea or another, that your decision be phrased in such a way. Listen up, all of you. Whereby, the wording does not contain any nuance of what you don't want or who you no longer wish to be. And simply is the establishment of who you are so that you are not running from who you were. You are not running from any negative idea but are simply walking to who you are. And thereby by convention distancing yourself from any former decision. But the hint of running away from something still contains the idea of that something very strongly. And since you cannot get away from anything, you can tell at all. It simply is the new decision and not not the old decision. Understand the distinction. Shutting. I want to understand that we are creating our own reality here. I call it drama. My drama every day is how I choose to see whether it is a relationship with others or within my own faith. Oh, and does drama have a connotation since that is your decision? It is a drama. Does it have a particular negative connotation? No, just like flow. Oh, well, generally speaking the way that you express your language, drama is very serious. Drama has a lot of interactions that can be rocky. Yes? Well, let me just rephrase that. Oh, do you understand that your words are revealing? I am not picking on you, but you also have the idea that you can create a musical, a comedy. Do proceed. In keeping with that comment, I've moved into creating a circumstances and decisions and moving forward into the ascension process. And now I look at it and consider a confusing. It has been bringing forth many different perspectives and many different aspects that are very confusing because they are new to me. By the way, co-fusing is simply taking many things that you are now observing and interpreting and simply re-establishing your relationship to them and ultimately it winds up with a decision between the options, a fusing of your intention. Is there a particular idea or perspective that you find confusing? Yes, I have a few. Oh, one. In some of the information that has been brought to me, I don't understand some of the information regarding spiritual hierarchy, slash galactic federation and how they work in alliance with one another in conjunction with the ascension process. Oh, allow me to say the following and see if this does not shed some light on this idea. From our perspective, there is no hierarchy. The reason that I explain this emphatically and specifically is because one of the qualities of the galactic community is complete and 100% equality. That does not mean there is not organization. That does not mean dispensation of particular actions and approaches. But only through what you would call the human interpretation of our structure does the idea of a hierarchy because you create your society in hierarchical fashion, become filtered into the interpretation of who we are. From my perspective, there is no hierarchy in the way that you are expressing the term. There is no linear qualitative difference between any job, any approach, any particular duty if you wish to call it that. And there is complete equality. There is no ascension in the aspect of moving through a set of rights. There is no ascension in the aspect of moving to a greater ability from a lesser ability as being worse and better. So understand that often when any individual from any society becomes aware of an idea, they initially interpret that idea through their vocabulary, through their present understanding. So for instance, in your past, there have been many predictions of catastrophes, apocalypses, and dire consequences. Now as I have said, there is no the future, but individuals in that timing were sensing a propensity, were sensing a tendency from the energy available at that moment. However they interpret that energy through the means of their societal approach, through the means of what was available to them at that time. Back in those days, things were a bit different upon your planet than they are now. So for instance, they did perceive there will be great change. That was the energy. That was the perception. However, back then the only way to interpret great change was through a complete tearing down of the present structure, a revolution, a rebellion, death, and destruction. And so therefore rather than simply a perception of change, it was changed in their archaic vocabulary, cataclysm, destruction. So the senseings of the ancient seers and the ancient prophecies were accurate in determining or predicting great change, but were not accurate in determining the methodology. They did not know certain things that would come into play between them and now that would allow that change to occur through individuals, that would allow that change to occur with what you call the hundredth monkey mass phenomena. They were not incorrect. They were simply interpreting it through the means available to them at the time. A large propensity of human consciousness still can only function, can only imagine a society functioning through a hierarchy, otherwise there'd be chaos. And although there is still organization when you are a physical being, it is not perceived through a hierarchical filter. So therefore again, anything that you attract is a perspective and you get to choose. If you simply understand that all the voices that you hear are choices that you hear, then you get to choose. That includes any other idea that you have heard, which apparently is not sitting very well with you, or any idea that you now attract, whether it be my perspective, which is your perspective, the timing for you to reveal your perspective to yourself, or any other means that you attract your knowledge, your realizations to yourself, it is always up to you to choose, and my suggestion is to trust what is comfortable to you, to trust what you're vibrating at, what excites you, what moves you. No one else is an authority until you in your vision build in your agreement to what they are saying. That is the only thing that seems to create external authority, and of course by convention, by extension hierarchy. Individuals that truly begin to express their self empowerment have no desire to have anyone else follow them, to take care of them, for that taking care of does not completely acknowledge their power. Perhaps it would be more that a master would be the first one to tell you that you're a master, and would do nothing for you, though perhaps the way that you would interpret their actions might loosely translate to a coach. Is this helpful or you would? Even more confused. How about that on tape again, thank you. If there is something that comes up as still being unclear, ask so that the answer to that will be on your tape as well. Well, my suggestion is that we're all for it will be gone. There is no hierarchy, and we're all out of it. Now, do understand. You contain it all. You can say there is a hierarchy or there is not, but if you wish to be accurate, there is a hierarchy, and there is none. Now you get to choose. Not negating, not invalidating, hierarchical approach, but simply choosing something that vibrates more strongly to who you know yourself to be, which is to say I validate that there are hierarchical expressions, but that is not my approach. Now when you said to me, I believe in equality, I believed you. I will not call you on that. The conviction was evident in your expression. Now the question is, you're going to trust in something anyway, like I said. Will you trust in your own knowingness, or will you fall into agreement with someone else's story? There's no question. Oh, back. Do understand that a question is simply an answer upside down, so the answer is right there. Oh, thank you. With you as well. Photon delt, is that also a perception? There is a physical counterpart to it, but it does not necessarily have the effects that have been predicted for the many photon belts that I'm supposedly already intersected with your reality, there is not what you would call the negative effect from it unless your decision places you of a vibration to experience negative effects in general, and therefore anything that you experience, you will tend to experience the negative aspects of. Understand what you call photon, simply in your own language, and your own physics are simply light, particles of light. Light in and of itself is a very high vibratory expression of consciousness. That consciousness is very raw and reflective, so therefore it mirrors your decision. And my knowing is that light is transformative and it's anything that's right on transform. Oh, right, that's one way to look at it. The idea is that the transformation begins from within you, and you then attract a symbol that you refer to as transformative. The light does not transform you. I could meet that light via this same vibration. Or simply allow yourself to have a shower when it comes by. Cool, thank you. But the idea is again, you are the light. You are the light, period. The light can represent the unconditional love of all that is. And all that is what you refer to sometimes as God, loves you unconditionally no matter what you will decide for yourself at any given moment. So simply you can choose to treat yourself with the same respect. One more, roles. Are we here specifically to take on specific roles? And I know it's a perception. However, there seems to be a lot of it in that feeling center, feeling center for most people that there is a specific purpose here for all of us. All right, but that supposition is a decision. So yes, you can absolutely experience that result and that reality. But that is not because anything was predestined or preordained. It is simply for whatever reason you falling into agreement with it. Truly you are a 100% spark of creation at every given moment who cannot easily be buttonholed into a particular role. You may assume roles to explore certain ideas, but when you decide graciously who you are, when that decision is a function of your preference, then the roles that you would assume in order to experience will be positive roles. You are not stuck in any role. And playing through something you perceive that you created as an experience ends or transforms the moment you make the new decision with no exceptions. And if the new decision is, I am that same person one moment later, you are. Absolutely. If the new decision is, I no longer choose to express a hierarchy which results in me feeling lesser and there being a greater to aspire to, again, wording in the positive, but to use it as an example, that I am an equal to all of creation. I choose to express that equality in everything that I do. And therefore, I choose to perceive that quality in others as well, then the veil of hierarchy will dissolve. Understand? Understand. So as a plan is evolving in its frequency as yours is, as you say, you are moving into a... Well, we do not necessarily consider it an evolution, but simply a conscious movement. But do proceed. Okay. Let's just say for the purposes of the take, conscious movement of all, the universe, it's being affected. This earth is affecting all. Well from your perspective, absolutely, for as I have said, when you change yourself, everything seems to change. Remember everything is multi-dimensional, infinite, and eternal. Everything contains an infinite number of facets and aspects. You in experiencing linear reality do not truly have the experience of interacting with the entire infinity of facets. You attract the perception of facets of any individual that is relevant to your particular decision and exploration. So as you begin to change your decision, as you begin to manifest your new decision, you interact with the corresponding facet of any other thing that you consider to be external. And so yes, the entire universe seems to change because you are now operating through a different set of facets with the infinite potentiality. Does that make sense or is it too confusing? No, I understand, but is there ever one perception? Well the perception that you would refer to as the perception of all that is, is at the same time a multiplicity and yet one perception. And that becomes slightly difficult to translate for it as an infinite concept. And you are at least now choosing to proceed through a finite point of view. So the answer is yes and no. And as you begin to expand your consciousness, expand your acceptance and allowance of more of yourself, you will find that paradox becomes the rule and not the exception. And that truly, since you contain it all, it is never, never this or that. It is always both. And that always puts you right back into the center to choose between them with absolutely equal ability. Oh, right? Yes, thank you. I thank you as well. What will you do? Either this or that. Do you wish to be more definite about it or would you like to think about it? No, I will say in thinking how many decisions. Oh, have you made one? Yes. Do you wish to share it? It is the same as what is in my center and make those decisions from that center of my dream at all times. Oh, you can never stray too far from yourself or everywhere you turn. There you are. And so your willingness to simply be more direct about knowing that no seeming external person can possibly know you better than you know yourself will allow part of your decision to be the certainty that you are now willing to honor who you are and settle for nothing less. No matter what you do. Everything's right. So he's choice. Everything's perfect, the perfect manifestation of whatever it is yet. But beginning to exercise choice consciously is the only thing that if you embrace and begin to express will immediately and fully transform your entire reality. You can do it on a gradient if you feel that completely transforming would be too sudden. But when you do it on a gradient, you are simply making decisions closer and closer to the you. You wish to be, to be, to be, to be, to be all that you had once. And ultimately where do you end up? That you. So you get to decide would you like to take the scenic route or would you like to simply beam yourself up? So to speak. Is that another process, Beanie? Well, you do. But I won't tell you. The idea is that there are many creative physical opportunities in your future and your particular fiction will often predict future reality. So you're a future self of Andrew, is that correct? No, in a sense. My particular reality, planet, experience, vibrates at a completely different time flow than your own. Approximately for the purposes of comparison, ten times faster. So what you would perceive as ten of your years would play out in my reality as a hundred years of history, although our particular relationship to time is far different from your own. So from your linear points of view, it would appear that we are in the future. But because we are already on a more accelerated timeframe, in comparison to your own, we cannot perceive each other. And so literally there are universes within a grain of sand. There are an infinite number of overlapping ideas or dimensions. They separate each other by wavelengths. And one of the expressions of the wavelengths is the flow of time, Street. From the channel's point of view, I could appear to be a future incarnation. From my point of view, he could appear to be a past self. But our realities are not in that type of sync for direct comparison. What are you following along? Blaming around the ascension process. Thank you. Oh, thank you. What a lovely image. Covering yourself with more of yourself. All right. Shutting. It's my own. Could you speak a little about a crime creator or God as we know him or her? And whether or not this is a, that this energy is a personal or a non-personal form. It is both, it is the idea of everything. And that is why we refer to it rather than nailing it down to a specific as simply all that is. In one way of looking at it, it can be perceived as in person. But just as valid, it can be perceived as a distinct, self-aware singular consciousness. And understand, you seem to experience yourselves as sparks of perhaps the infinite white light that you would call all that is or God. From the point of view that you have, anything that you experience is automatically something that the overall light, that the overall, all that is can experience. So the proof, if you wish to call it that, that all that is can be a self-aware singular consciousness is the mere fact that you experience yourself in that way. On the other hand, you experience yourself in a finite way. And all that is can create that awareness, but also has the awareness of everything else. So the idea of singular awareness really takes on quite a different meaning. One way to express all that is physically is unconditionally loving white light that permeates all creation. That is all creation. And at the same time is its own sensei and self. Now if this is confusing, again it is because we are discussing infinite terms through finite means. Is there some specific question that you have in this regard? How about does this personality actually travel into the realm of time and space as we are now? There is an apparent while you are exploring linear reality of a continuation of seemingly a singular persona. But as you begin to expand, you associate yourself as only that persona. And you begin to associate yourself as also that persona. Does that translate? Yeah, but I think more what I was asking you is, as the personal form of prime creator or god, does that personal form travel into the realms that we travel into? Well you are speaking very arbitrarily for it is an infinite creation. And within that infinite creation, at the same time that there is the concept of time before during and after, there is the overall concept of timelessness, which is eternal nowness. There are multiple spontaneous incarnationalness or anything you wish to call. So what you are saying is available as a reflection. But what you are discussing as all that is is much larger and again even this term, any term that we use bumps up against comparisons that do not inherently exist, for larger and smaller, still implies space and time. So trying to put this all together, I assume that it is possible that the prime creator could assume a physical body like one of us here has and we could run into him on the street. Well, that is one way to put it. Yes, it is absolutely possible. But you are continuing to remove yourself as that being. In other words, you are living proof that that is so. Simply part of your definition, part of your decision is to assume that you are not. Very creative. But do you understand the notion? I think so. Therefore, infinite does not occupy space and the idea of existing within the infinite is only a finite way to perceive it, to wrap your finite, perceptional mind around it. So infinite, if you were to attempt to view it, pervades every direction on and on into infinity with no beginning, middle and ending, does not have a beginning, never was not, never will not be, never will be anything less than it already is, and never will be anything more than it already is. Where it is already everything. And as I even begin to perpetuate this explanation, you bump up against the boundaries of finite vocabulary. If there is something else specific you wish to pursue, by all means do. I find this quite fascinating. How I got here was through association with a group called the Hare Krishna, is you familiar with that? Yes. And of course the belief there is that God as the original personality has actually traveled on this world as inhuman form, of course not really human form but as an apparition of human form. All right. And again that would be accurate in one way of looking. But all that is is unconditionally loving 100% completely. So understanding those qualities, when you are assessing whether there is a particular individual that would embody this, assumably human, linear, limited qualities such as judgment and conditioning of love would not apply to that being in my particular interpretation of what all that is is. So when you are plugging in the model does this particular person represent a direct incarnation of God, then be willing to be clear to yourself what the qualities of God would be and see if that individual no matter who it is expresses that degree of complete unconditional love. Since everything is all that is, God, the reason that it is explained, that all that is is unconditionally loving is because there is nothing outside all that is. So another way to put it is that all that is is unconditionally fluffing. And any manifestation that would seem to be less removed in your physical terms from God consciousness would honor 100% completely every aspect of reality, every polarity of reality, things that would seem to what you call the general human consciousness to be positive and negative would be completely equal valid representations to all that is. Now I trust your own sense of discernment to plug in that explanation if you even in that sense are willing to entertain it and answer your own question. And I remind you in no uncertain terms that you are such a manifestation. And one can say, well, this individual incarnation of God is more God than that individual manifestation of God because they do this, because they do that. But ultimately it is inaccurate. You are all equal, equal, equal, no hierarchy, equal members or manifestations or expressions or reflections or spark of the infinite creation itself. What you call judgment, what you call vengeance, what you call punishment. Although they exist as concepts within all that is, do not represent the approach of the honoring of the sovereignty of all of creation of a pure manifestation of the approach of all that is. Does that make sense? Well, I am going to have to work on it. Do you feel that God would vanquish all evil? No, it has to be. Do you think that evil exists or what you are referring to as evil? Outside all that is. And all that is is everything except evil. Oh, it is just clarity. How? Would a direct incarnation of the unconditionally loving white light of creation come and destroy this. Destroy that. Unquish this. Re-vangence upon that. Does that make logical sense to you? Sure, it is part of everything. Just as soon as you do that as the opposite. Now how does that answer your question? Well it gives me more than I actually asked. Well thank you. Let's work on that. How are you sir? Yes for now thank you. Are you through working on it? No. By no means. Are you through now? No. How long will you dangle as a character for you your decision? For as long as I want. Take all the time you need. I thank you. There will be time for one more sharing. Shoving. I just wanted to share something. Do you know that this is Chester my husband when married maybe you know that. Congratulations. Thank you. I wanted to say that I don't know about six or seven months ago we completely transformed our relationship. Oh right. And what happened? You made the decision. Right. What is through the awareness of something that you told me or reminded me. Ah through your own reflection system. You will see. And the specific awareness was that the present is not a result of the past unless I say it is. Thank you. Well put. And so that really worked. We just sort of forgot all those things that weren't working or just moved off of them. Well do understand how that fits into the mechanics we have discussed this evening. When you make the decision of who you are you can simply make it because you're making or you can make it with a justification or a rationalization. If that rationalization is I am this person because I have done this in the past you do not actually experience being a result of that past you re-corrifying the past in the moment as an excuse to make a particular decision in the moment. So there is the apparent I am affected by the past but in being willing to make the decision based on who you are what you prefer what excites you with your integrity then the baggage of the past is no longer relevant to the new decision. Oh I can't. So really I just made another choice. You always do. Now if that choice is most agreeable to you congratulations. Oh look at this and thank you and I wanted to share that because you don't seem like your voice came in my head and said that although I know what the advice is you know that all the present is not a result of the past so I just wanted to share that. Oh right. I asked you a question by way of what you would refer to as one moment. Oh why. A testimonial. When you shifted your decision did the other individual seem to change. Completely. Oh miracle. Yes it is a miracle. All right I am being facetious or miracles are the rule and not the exception. Once you begin to allow your decision to include that definition. Yes it is amazing how people seem to miraculously shift and someone who you just cheated. I don't know how to believe all of a sudden you are not hating it. You know what I mean. Well not exactly. But I will take your word for it. I mean it is like a whole 180 degree from what seems to be hopeless. Wait a minute I am just going to make another choice. You recreate yourself 100% in every given moment and now you have recreated yourself to interact with another facet of any individual that you perceive. And so miraculously they seem to have changed. Simply you have made the decision. And you are living the fruits of that decision as you all do with every decision you make whether positive or negative. All right I am so excited. Thank you. Before we depart mail proceeding. You weren't going to let me go without that. I thought not. I think I am still reluctant to share a lot of personal stuff in these public sessions. Oh right bye. I don't know. It is not a comfort private session. But is there not something you wish to say. Yes. Do you believe? From the very beginning I wondered how it was that I attracted you into my life. I perceived that you attracted me because I was so drawn to the energy and so drawn to come and I still am and probably attracted you here tonight. Well again as I began and is a co-creation we each attract whatever will benefit us the most to support the decisions that we have made and therefore we function mutually in that capacity. I think sometimes said that when a student is ready the teacher will appear and that certainly seems to be the case in our interaction. Oh. I wonder what if anything else there is in our connection. Is there some connection that I am not aware about? Oh right so may I assume from your statement that this isn't enough. If you were to perceive the most accurate representational answer to that question rather than looking in your so-called past the relationship is potential for what you would call your so-called future. Now not to remove yourself from the moment do I say this but simply to allow you to stray your gaze in perhaps the more accurate direction. Has my gaze been in an inaccurate direction so far? Not necessarily. To further expand upon the answer simply again it is our desire to communicate in a way by invitation and so we have taken you up on yours. Perhaps not in the form you expected but congratulations for that. Everything that is a part of your teaching I am working into my life the decisions I am making and I am making decisions to do not yet. Oh and I thank you for that. A decision as well. Yes. It has been a wonderful experience for me. May I ask you one last question? All right. How about one more? Did you not request the information that you have received regardless of whether it was from us seemingly as a reflection or anyone else? Did you not specifically request it? Certainly my understanding otherwise we have been here. But can you be more remembering of a specific time where you strongly made the request? Do not answer. Play around with it. I thank you all for your willingness to co-create this interaction in such a way where we may all share aspects, reflections of each other's consciousness in tandem and in love and joy. Do understand if there is anything that you perceive that is joyful from this interaction from what you perceive to be me, pat yourself on the back. It is you. I am merely a mirror and can only reflect back the degree of brilliance from the original source material. So celebrate the recognition in yourself that as you expand you now attract the means, the methods, the tools, the keys to make the decision consciously. I bid you a most fondant love. Good evening. Bye all.
