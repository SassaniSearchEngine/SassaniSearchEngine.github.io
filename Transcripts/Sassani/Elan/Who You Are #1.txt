 All right, I'll say I bid you greetings this evening of your time as you create time to exist and extend my unconditional love and appreciation for your willingness to interact with me in this way. Do understand that we do consider from our end that your interactions with us are in fact a gift and do contribute to our understanding of both you as individuals, you as a society and as well enable us to expand our understanding of ourselves. For as we have shared with you many times in many different forms, it is our perspective that each individual 100% entirely creates their own entire reality, every single aspect of it and this would include from your perspective that you create me as interacting or reflecting with you in your own reality. The paradox of reality and part of the infinite aspect of reality is that this is true for every single individual and although it would seem how is this possible, how does everyone actually create it all, the bottom line is this is how it functions and these types of concepts which would seem normally to be mutually exclusive actually coexist and this is part of the definition of infinity that all possibilities are already true and it becomes a matter of you as a filter consciousness deciding which of the infinity, which of both sides of everything you will choose to perceive and you will choose to express and experience. Truly the gift, the greatest gift perhaps you can say that you have to offer is being the truest version of yourself that you can possibly be. For understand although you are foundationally and fundamentally, multi-dimensional, infinite and eternal beings as far as the way you are expressing yourself in this life, this is the only time so to speak you will be the you you are now, the version of the you that you are now the specific version and so therefore when understanding that as an infinite being you are choosing to have a finite experience and understanding you will only have this version of the experience but once being the best version of you that you can be is the most conscious and direct benefit that you can in that sense contribute to your own life, to your own perception and to your reality so to speak and so your willingness to define who you are and express who you are consciously and fully is your greatest gift to not only again yourself but all those that you seem to interact with. Often you have in your society as individuals a notion that there is a mass belief, a mass truth, a mass consciousness that in many ways sees you as a particular being and you will often accept cues from your perception of the mass perception of you and by into that idea and actually express a version of yourself that is what everyone else wishes to see at least your understanding of what you think everyone else wishes you to be. In that sense you are not necessarily fully expressing yourself according to the you that you know yourself to be and allow me to say in no uncertain terms only you truly know who you are. Anyone else can merely have a version of you that serves them for their exploration and in that sense their version is no truer than your own version of yourself unless you believe their version and begin to decide that perhaps their version is true and then you express yourself in that way. The point here is that you always have the opportunity and you always have the 100% ability to simply express yourself as you know yourself to be. Why this is a great gift is because each and every one of you are a 100% unique perspective not existing anywhere else in the multiverse in exactly the way that you express yourself and so the more that you are willing to express your uniqueness as you know it to be the more you are consciously contributing by providing a clear reflection of who you are for other individuals to do with what they will which you have no control over for however anyone else interprets you will always be up to them as well as it is up to you to interpret your own self. And so when we speak about creating your life through deciding who you are trusting that decision and then acting as though you trust that decision as a template as a model to begin to create consciously the result of being willing to do this fully is that you express yourself as you know yourself to be most fully and this gives anyone who would attract you in your reality the opportunity to take what you have to offer and use it in whatever creative way they will. If you are interacting with another individual and you are withholding who you are to some degree because you believe they have an expectation about who you are and therefore when you interact with them you allow them to see what you think they want to see. You are actually allowing them to have an elaborate conversation with themselves rather than with the unique perspective that you have to offer and of course as there is in everything there is value in this but it does not give the other individual an opportunity to grow in the unique way that they would were they exposed to you being yourself fully. And so perhaps one first step is to begin to trust your own preferred interpretation of who you are and realize that you are not truly doing anyone a big favor by saying what they wish to hear and in fact are depriving them of your unique viewpoint. Now when you attract yourself to a situation, when you attract yourself to an interaction with another individual from their end they have attracted you and one might in that sense assume that they have attracted you for the unique perspective that you have to offer. If you are willing to give them that perspective and trust that you feel the way you feel for a valid reason then whether or not they agree with the perspective or not they are given an opportunity to grow by having a comparison of another way to be another option of how one can express themselves. Again when you tell them what they wish to hear which is not truly a representation of who you are in a sense you deprive them of this gift that you are and so beginning to trust who you are can begin to take the form of being willing to express yourselves trusting what you attract yourself to to fully be yourself in any given situation. And when you do this you become a clear reflection of who you are which paradoxically allows your reality to build itself around you more accurately according to your desires, according to your preferences because you are allowing those desire and preferences to be constantly expressed and not perhaps you can say confusing the issue with expectations that others have of you that sell yourself in many ways short of who you actually know yourself to be. Seeing yourself know some individuals may interpret this as being a complicated procedure is actually the easiest procedure there is in expressing yourself or it is effortless to simply do that what you know to be true and actually takes a bit of effort concentration and attention to details to say the things that others wish to hear and maintain the consistency of really having that point of view. So you do not force yourself to be who you are in fact if you wish to get technical if anything in a situation where you are compromising who you are and saying what someone else may wish to hear you are forcing yourself to be what you think they want to see. When it comes to being yourself however there is simply no forcing involved no forcing necessary and in fact quite the opposite of forcing or manipulating you simply allow or let go and be yourself allow yourself to be who you are. Your willingness to do this boldly and your willingness to do this consistently will allow you to see how in many situations where formerly you assumed a person would act a particular way if you actually gave your real opinion and so therefore perhaps you did not in that case you will find invariably that their response will not necessarily be the response you expected and you will generally speaking find if not immediately then down the line and appreciation from the individual for your willingness to actually give a counter point of view for that gives someone an option a new option saying what they wish to hear they could sit in the mirror and have that conversation without you having your unique presence and perspective available is the gift that you have to offer and again by way of analogy by way of a metaphor when you are willing to give away the gift of who you are your willingness to allow the individual receiving the gift to do whatever it is they wish including return the gift then allows them to do what they want with who you are you need not force yourself upon someone else in order to simply express who you are and allow them once again to do what they will with it which they will anyway and so therefore when you begin to get a feel for what I am saying and realize that it is all right all well to be who you are consciously and fully you will feel generally what you call a sense of relief because acting as others would have you be really takes quite a bit of vigilance and effort and again attention to detail to maintain the viewpoint you feel you wish that they will see understand by the way by way of a side note that most often what you think they want to hear is not really what they want to hear anyway and so that is a mental game that you will play with yourself and present things to themselves or to the other individuals that you think they want to hear sometimes they may other times they may not but always when you are willing to be who you are fully will that contribute in a positive way to any given situation as you begin to do this as I have said you become a more powerful clarified expression of who you are and this makes the things the people the interactions the relationships that would utilize that type of a person most maximally able to see you by being willing to express yourself clearly you can more clearly attract the things that will support that version of yourself and so there are many perhaps you can say fringe benefit to being yourself in any given situation remembering that only you know who you are and understanding that in your heart of hearts you can always ascertain in any given situation no matter what your emotional expression is at that moment that you have the best grasp of who you are can allow you to begin to express this consciously and fully and cannot then allow the benefits that are reaped by your unique perspective to pervade the interactions relationships and situations in your life therefore I remind you when we say we get something out of this interaction we mean and what we get other than again more of an ability to define ourselves and our overall conception of reality is that we also get the unique perspective the unique approach that you have to offer in a given situation that is many times different from what we would do in a given situation and many times what you are doing we may find preferable to what we are doing and so it gives us more options as well but this works also between you and members of your own society you have very much to offer one another and if you are willing to dive into who you are understanding that fundamentally you are a positive being able to produce that which you wish to produce in your life to interact with those you wish to interact with in your life to express what it is you have to express in your life this changes the flavor of the way you present yourself in life for life begins to now feel natural not normal for normal is a judgment is a standpoint is a mass judgment call if you will but natural which is your own understanding version of yourself therefore when interacting with you I simply ask if you wish if you will to simply be yourself most fully and that enables us the greatest opportunity to glean the specific gifts that you as an individual have to offer your willingness again to extend this to other members of your own society will include with it results that will be joyous and surprising when you realize that who you are adds more to the situation than who others who you perceive others think you are think about it for a while if you wish unless of course you're the type of person that doesn't care in which case move on in that light and tying this all together understand that you always in every given moment decide who you are I am this person you then proceed with the premise that you are this person and your actions express and reflect being that person until you change the decision and then everything shifts along with the decision but your willingness to have that decision be a conscious knowing version of who you are in your preferred state your preferential you if you will allows everything in your reality to clarify and allows you to attract exactly the things you need to continue to be that whole version of yourself conversely if you in that sense squelch yourself on a consistent basis you attract a support to continue to squelch yourself and so therefore that support may appear frustrate may appear paradoxically non-supported all it takes to shift this is to be willing to clearly express who you are by determining who that preferred you is and simply deciding all right I'm going to decide I'm somebody I know that in fact even if I'm not conscious of it I'm going to decide on somebody anyway on some level as I sometimes create level so therefore why not get in touch with who I want to be who I see myself at ideally as you say and have that be the decision about who I am when you are willing to build into your decision your knowingness of who you are as unique being and maintain that decision allowing your actions to continue to reflect it your physical reality shifts to support that new fuller no hold barred version of who you are and therefore the face the image the look of the support becomes abundant becomes supportive becomes reinforcing and not squelching or frustrating always using the very same mechanism you already use to create your life though using it consciously and there is the key maintaining your focus in a conscious way on who you ideally know yourself to be and your willingness to maintain that as you say flawlessly seamlessly in an uninterrupted manner allows the reality around which you build around yourself to reflect that in exactly the same mechanism that had given you whatever the face of your life is right now so therefore if there are things in your life which you say you do not prefer you may understand that it has simply been a matter of having decisions be decisions of a you that you do not prefer decisions of perhaps you that everyone else says you must be so I must be but it only gives you the effect of being any person when you fall into agreement with any assessment made of you and so ultimately it always boils back down to your own decision in this moment I am this person and there is where your power lies in understanding that you do this anyway you understand the simplicity and the automatic effortlessness of it in being willing to label yourself consciously you now use the very same simple mechanism you flawlessly have used your entire existence in a constructive conscious supportive productive preferential manner nothing new here however it can give the a parasy of a complete newness across the board in your life when you are willing to be consistent about it and not only do individuals use the assessment of others and the expectation of others to make their decision in the moment but often you will also use circumstances as evidence to shift your decision if you decide I am this person this is my ideal self and evidence comes along which is neutral but you assign it the meaning of running contrary to your decision of who you are only will that change everything if you now shift your decision and say well I must not be the new person because this evidence shows me I am not but actually that evidence is a neutral set of props that you interpreted according to an older point of view and ultimately did not shift back to the quote unquote old you although that erroneous until you decided or fell into agreement or interpreted the evidence to mean that and shifted your decision pivoting on the evidence all circumstance is fundamentally neutral and you can always look at both sides of all circumstance in terms of also supporting the decision of who you are if something comes along when you have decided I am a particular person and seems to look contrary to who you are that is not the only thing that that symbol means it is one possible interpretation your willingness to either see how that is of service to you and if that is obvious using that information or if it is not apparent how that is of service to you simply insisting that it must be because it happened after you made your decision then you are maintaining your positive decision then you are not allowing anything to talk you so to speak out of it and then and here comes as you say the bonus the face of the evidence begins to change because you do not continually vacillate your decision and your results then do not continually be vacillated results when you are willing as you say the samurai to maintain a resolve of who you are no matter what and allow everything to only be a supportive reflection of that decision very very quickly chronologically it takes little time the actual face of the evidence also seems to transform to now support who you are it's still neutral evidence but it seems easier to label it as a support when you begin to allow your decision to be unswerving to allow your decision to be consistent to allow yourself to say when something comes along that seems to be evidence against your decision perhaps in the past I would have said that proves my decision did not stick and I cannot even see how that particular incident supports my decision but I know that it does because nothing is extraneous in reality and if it is important for me to see how it supports my decision then I will down the line and if it is important for you to see it you will but sometimes it simply is the opportunity and the only reason that something comes along which appears to oppose your decision is to give you the opportunity to really prove to yourself if you play that game of proof with yourself that I am still this person anyway even though that is happening and that is a service from your external circumstance from your feedback mechanism simply something that shows you I'm not changing my decision even if that were true which I know it's not because I've made the decision and I'm simply now maybe not able to see how this supports the decision but it doesn't matter I know that it does I still decide I am this person on to the next thing you already do this when you vacillate your decision you get again a vacillated result and alternating intermittent result but conversely when you maintain that decision it smooths out quickly and there is your power not asking you to do anything new not asking you to acquire new skills build new muscles exercise your mentality but simply to understand the simple way that you already express yourself and if it is desirable to you begin to do so consciously and reap the rewards of a universe which is only inside of you anyway that supports the new decision and allows you to celebrate the expression of who you are perhaps rather than dreaded as sometimes perhaps some of you do and so therefore you have everything you need always have and now are reflecting to yourself in perfect timing through whatever means whether you perceive it as me whether you perceive it as a book whether you perceive it as someone you have spoken to it is truly you revealing to yourself through your own timing what you already know because you are as I have said fundamentally an infinite being and that means you already contain everything expressing yourself in a linear form where you do not always have the immediate understanding that you contain everything still allows you to remind yourself that you do and access from that totality the specific linear things which will be of service to you in the moment or that is the presentation of the filter if you will of consciousness that allows you to experience the apparent of time and space before during and after all of which still contain now for it is always right now even right now and right now is when you always make that decision in every given now moment which seems like a successive succession of now but is truly one eternal now from the infinite perspective so therefore you have it all you always have and it is a matter of being willing to express it as fully as you wish you will find in interacting with me that this is my own approach not that I am saying that it is better but I am vouching for the effectiveness of it for never have I regretted in any way being myself and reaping the rewards and reflections of who I am in my reality and therefore this is one option for you as well if you wish only you know who you are and if you wish you can entitle this interaction who you are if you do not then be yourself and entitle it anything you wish for your willingness to share the gift the spark of consciousness that you are your unique 100% individual perspective I and members of my society thank you and at how we may mutually be of service to each other in the phase of these interactions that we have called the sharing I consider myself fairly good learning conscious creation and creating what I want myself all right when will you be very good at that I'd like to know that I'll know okay are you willing to express that you contain within you the ability to be very good at it and before you say anything allow me to say from my perspective since you still tend to hinge on the perspective of others you absolutely have that ability I know I have the ability but I feel like in the last few months my ability has been shaken a bit all right how have you allowed you to express yourself in a way that creates the apparent see that you can be shaken from your foundation that's a good one well I know that I've been sleeping like 10 sometimes 12 hours a day I can't remember my dreams I had been a lucid dreamer I still consider myself a lucid dreamer I feel like I love control that something outside of me is influencing me oh are you willing to access your internal wisdom consciously purposely all right if you sit down and are willing to simply explore who you are being willing to discover who you are and when you have a grasp of that hit the ground running as you say you can expedite the process that you are creating and the reason that you are creating the process from my perspective that you are creating in terms of the excess sleep the what you call seeming lack of dreaming is that you are giving yourself an opportunity to turn within in a sense you are creating the apparent see that you are forcing yourself to turn with him if you are willing to embrace the process of turning within and dive into it you will no longer need to create external symbology to reflect to yourself that now is the timing therefore what we have in that sense opened up this interaction with is very timely for all of you but is also apropos for the conversation that I am having with you now for your willingness to define ideally this is who I am and then go one step further and say I am this person now that I've defined what that person looks like how that person is I am this person that is all it takes and that is where your process that you are creating will eventually lead you but you need not continue to create it in this way I assume in mentioning it you are saying you prefer to move things along and so therefore get down to the business as you say of getting in touch with who you are which need not be a complicated long process unless you insist that it is it can simply be a matter of sitting down closing your eyes taking a few deep breaths never mind if you are not one of the individuals who has what you call a propensity toward meditation that is not important what is important is that you sit down blank your mind as much as it will blank do not judge if things flow across the stream of your consciousness allow yourself to imagine what you would feel like with no symbols surrounding it if you were truly right now already excited mock it up build the excitement simply seeing well how would I feel if I were excited which is a way to essentially trick yourself into creating excitement using a removed mechanism sit there until you physically feel excitement then allow yourself to see what you are doing in your imagination and watch the surprising thing that come up watch the symbols that resonate strongly with you while you are in the vibration of feeling excitement for no apparent reason if you create the excitement vibration then your consciousness will provide the reasons for that excitement and you will then be able to see very clearly ah when I do this when I say that when I express this it moves me it gives me passion it gives me excitement is that simple enough yes it is when you do that and see this person who you will generally find most desirable a most desirable version of myself then it is not difficult to choose that version understanding you will choose some version and it is now up to you to have it be the preferred you therefore if you are willing to do that very simply keep it simple no long process and come up with even a working model if you will of that you then your entire process will shift as you say on the dime now watch the irony here in the way that you all create yourselves if you don't do that if you simply continue to allow this process to play out at some point where this is a very contracted what you sometimes called depressive process all contraction or depression or depressiveness really is is an expression of realizing that your answers no longer lie outside and that outside will provide nothing but more confusing options and when individuals emerge from what you generally societally refer to as depression they emerge anew because the end of that process that you create is ultimately a decision I am this person generally a desirable version of yourself so you are not in that sense negating the reason that you have created this process you are simply expediting it moving it along in a more immediate and conscious way and this can apply to any one of you who are feeling any such version of this type of contractiveness when your answers no longer seem to lie outside they are strongly and firmly within and you have access to them again by being willing to create the vibration of excitement you then provide your consciousness the opportunity to project what you would be doing to feel excited and you give yourself as you say cues mental cues is that too simple and too good to be true now it makes sense hey i'm going to give it a shot do you feel if you were to truly get in touch with the most joyous expression of who you are that you just might sound a little bit more excited about it yeah do understand in many ways that laughter is the first step and that it is no accident of semantics if you will that by lightening up you then enable yourself to experience and life and meant so by all means allow yourself to be amused for that amused posture that amused expression or vibration always draws you to an appreciation point of view as opposed to a judgmental point of view all right thank you very much oh i have done nothing and in fact thank yourself all right yes sir all right ma'am shitting hey and just to enhance that i think maybe what we're looking for because i'm experiencing exactly what she's been experiencing and it's a contraction of some sort of depression all right before we proceed to simply use what has already been in that sense put out can you apply what i have just said to yourself yes what is your feeling before even doing so about what may occur when you do that i've already done it and i can't seem to even get in touch with what you just grabbed all right so thank you very much for speaking up for that is an expression in that sense of continuing to assume that the present you always make your decision of who i am right now is a result of the past if you do something that is something you have already done you are not doing exactly what i am saying some version of what i am saying you are doing but not exactly and if you did something and did not get a result that really truly has nothing to do with who you are right now unless you build into your decision right now and by the way i can pretty much expect this to be a bust and believe me that registers so the point is i am not asking you to do the same thing quite the contrary i am asking you to do something completely new the difference being to truly truly conjure up the excitement till it's palpable do you feel you had done that last time no because i i get interrupted by this chatter that is in my head in my imagination of the situations that i'm in a basement all right but do understand that in the excited state there will be also a version of chatter chatter can simply be the wallpaper and need not be the building if you will well i would like to remove them or at least set them aside so i can see clearly what you're talking about but the idea is that you cannot set something aside where will you put it when you are everything the idea is to simply create the excitement the chatter is coming watch the chatter look at it maybe the chatter will actually become amusing and allow you to shift your mood but feeling excitement is really quite simple even if you're saying all right and perhaps this will be a tool as well can i remember a time where i was very excited now we specifically have been in that sense suggesting to create the excitement first with no vision of what that excitement in that sense is created by and then we are telling you you will see the things that are exciting to you but you can also do it the other way around using symbols and cues to drum up the excitement and then move on with the process so if it takes a particular place a particular person a particular symbol a particular book a particular as you say television show whatever it takes where you can picture that you are excited the moment you create that feeling of excitement you're right in tandem with the so-called process i am describing let us go in order can you picture something that is truly exciting to you what do you love to do no i can do that as you mentioned this album i um what is the next thing the next one if it is something you feel you do not wish to share with the group no no no there's i was understanding what you said and i don't have the problem with that that i could definitely drum up little instantaneous excitement well we are actually looking for quite a bit more yeah well when you said is there anything in your life and i thought in my past my whole life that i've experienced yes i could think of an exciting thing oh then for the simple purpose of creating the initiation of the spark of excitement use that symbol but once you feel the excitement shift your inner gaze to the blank screen and see what you now see yourself doing with the foundational underlying vibration of excitement and you will circumvent the little maze you have created in this process when you do that and again i suggest doing so in solace you will be able to then take advantage of what i am saying more directly and understand that you have done it and not the process itself and you will also understand it is not the same process you have not already done that and gotten a negative result you did something else close to what i was saying and got the corresponding result of that approach which is all well and good now you are talking about conscious do you feel you deserve to live the life that you prefer that's been coming up lately again oh right do you feel that you deserve it i could say deferred maze those yes oh i would perhaps the most accurate answer be yes and no all right why no no because what i'm experiencing right now in in my life would say that was at face value right now is not my preferred reality and does that then mean that because you are experiencing something you do not desire that you therefore do not deserve to experience that what you do desire where is the logic i am simply asking i guess it's still in my belief structure and it's surprising to me at this point oh well do understand as we have said all along that you contain it all not everything except this and so therefore you truly if you wish to get technical not to overwhelm you but to hand you back your power on a plate do deserve everything you desire and don't deserve anything you desire now what are you going to do oh you don't have the place that i prefer you choose which one you prefer to express because both are equally true and therefore both have equal acceptability to express them and both will get a 100 result if you choose to express that you do not deserve the joy and ecstasy that you wish to create you will create a life of dangling it in front of you and never quite getting it if you decide consciously to express that you no matter what the face of your life and perhaps because of the face of your life that you do deserve that is what will enable it to change but not by buckling into the evidence which is very literally what you have described to me that you are doing well i decide to change but these things come along and they are more powerful than my decision in fact they tell me my decision isn't sticking how could my decision possibly stick if this is happening but ultimately the paradox and the irony is it always boils down to you finally saying and so therefore my decision did not stick and the moment you do that your reality realigns to the decision not sticking and very literally seems to support very strongly that it has not back and forth i deserve i do not i deserve i do not i can have what i want i can i can have what i want i can't this creates a intermittent result preferential things non-preparential things preparential things non-preparential things you're still getting the results of your decision in many ways it is a matter of being willing to completely commit to your decision and perhaps at first may feel that you need to create the endurance if you will to persist news if you will is that if you are persisting and willing to persist in expressing that decision consciously and we have said this before generally we refrain from such labels but it really is a demonstrative statement for just three days you will see a change and immediate and sweeping change but not if it's three days of let's test this out not if it's three days of by the end of these three days i'm going to come to an assessment and it can go either way that literally sabotage is the mechanism and no external sabotage going on simply your own willingness to not commit to who you are i understand that it can seem to individuals particularly if you are testing this rather than committing to it as though your decision is delusional that your decision is fooling yourself but only if you step this up as a test for setting it up as a test has the underlying supposition that you probably can and will fail setting it up as a statement setting it up as an act of creation is far more definite and allows that evidence to change i know we have discussed this before with you specifically i know we have discussed this in many different forms and i also know perhaps you may be still doing some of that well i've heard this before but the idea is everything i have just said you have not heard before it is brand new and your implementation of it because it is brand new can only give a brand new result is the emphasis that has arisen out of this interaction helpful definitely i'm i'm hearing you with new ears but it's true i really understand what you're saying and it leads me to a question not to place anything outside of myself but is there something going on with all of us in the mass consciousness that we seem to be going through this s you want to call it that because i don't slew myself from anybody else and i have been attracting understand that you can interpret it in this way but it is a bit backward it is more as though what you go through you will then perceive the mass to go through but because your definition society have been the other way around you create the opposite appearances as you shift you will come back interact with me and say miraculous thing happened a few weeks ago everyone was in flux even me i changed and suddenly everyone else seems to have changed what's going on it's the universal abnormality and anomaly no it is the law of creation you experience the reality you are being the vibration of always which is perhaps the more accurate way to say what you put out is what you get back and i say more accurate because there's no out to put something there's no back to get it from what you are being in any given moment the vibration you are expressing in any given moment immediately gives you back immediately supports that particular perspective okay so wouldn't it be easier though for all of us to create together on a timeline kind of thing some sort of real idea that we are experiencing right now together and that may be okay so we just give this some real evidence to say just why i'm going through this and it gives me faith to get to the you know the preferred process ultimately no and the reason is because the evidence can only follow the shift in expression now individuals will say sometimes well the evidence follows the belief but i remind you you have all beliefs in their offices so it is not a matter of a belief that you have and you don't have another belief and the one that you have will have the result it is a matter of having both beliefs and the one you express will provide the evidence there is a distinction we are going through some sort of stellar and we speak of harmonic emergencies and numbers and dates are we going through a transformation now if you are willing to look at it from one point of view absolutely there is a mass transformation taking place the reason i de-emphasize that in this discussion is that that literally has nothing to do with your personal transformation unless you build into your decision some type of comfort that that is happening as well all right but understand the mechanism is not that it is driving you along or adding to your energy whatsoever simply that you are using it to hinge your decision which is all well and good i am simply suggesting to remain conscious about the mechanism and then in the end assigning the credit where it is due you you have decided you have made the change you have seen the difference and miraculously in your perception then everything else sweepingly changes as well to match the new version of who you are automatically instantaneously and so yes from one perspective perhaps my point of view it may appear you are having a mass planetary transformation but from your perspective the only way to experience this is to individually transform and that is where you will see the greatest evidence of other individuals transforming and the reason i highlight this is when you are creating turmoil and confusion and perpetuating that into your decision yes it appears that everyone else is also in major flux understood yes and others will seem to change when you shift your perspective instantaneously you mean to tell me this stuff really works i just stated that i am god i mean i must be because i create everything around all right i will say you are starting to sound as though you mean it i understand it right now i want to continue to create that understanding yes in the moment right now do allow yourself to sit down and drum up excitement no matter what symbol it takes to drum it up then blank the screen and see what you are doing now with that foundation of excitement that will take into consideration some of the parameters that are in place in your life now that perhaps had never been before and allow you to come up with creative solutions to express your excitement here's the key with what's available right now and that is always the only starting place from wherever you're at and is the only starting place you need to affect a complete change one moment is that all i was going to say i'm going to listen up to everybody else is sharing because that's just a support and as i have said often in what you call past interactions if someone stands up and answers the question and you say oh my goodness not that question again that is the one you may really wish to perk up and listen to i thank you today um i just want to say this is great it's so perfect but what i have been experiencing here you say um great i just want to share something with you but i have been doing recently and more of that i was focusing so much on what i didn't want that's what i was getting so and i know that probably has a lot to do as a preferred self but well again it is what you focus your attention on and paradoxically you have this word which seems to have more power than it does it's called not i do not want this i do not want that but when you say i do not want this i do not want that you are continually focusing on this and that exactly and that is the solution to that type of approach rather than running away from the things that are not representative of who you are define the things that are representative of who you are walking toward them you take what you no longer wish to focus on you find what it is you wish to focus on by focusing on that the thing you do not wish to focus on still exists there's no where for it to go there is no outside but it is no longer relevant to you and it is no longer in your stream of visions therefore effectively it's not there but not because you have run from it because you're too darn busy being yourself that will often happen as you are willing to increase your inner vision of who you are your external world then reflect that clarity as you clarify your own version of yourself yes very very i have a question um i've been trans-channeling and having me interactions and i see myself um when i start to go to the chamois um the the ship i feel it's the mothership i go into this room and it's a huge white light that comes down over me and i'm sitting like an Indian stop and i see the outline is around me and then i have a friend in front of me so i'm aware that i'm here but i'm aware that i'm there obviously so the person will ask the questions and it will come through and i feel okay and it's great it's not like a real deep trance kind of like a medium light chance because i'm somewhat aware it is the idea of allowing the information to come through but being willing to still participate with it is the exact level of trance in that sense that is most beneficial in the age of being willing to wake up to more of yourself and not be oblivious or in that sense remove your own credit from the process okay which works not great until now here come the the old judgment where i start judging myself by the way you understand whatever you are about to say is part of your decision do proceed oh well i know that i've made that decision but now it's just new decision and what was that old decision for the purposes of continuity um well i whenever i would start to realize that part of me was coming out of it i would start judging myself and i just kind of like we just connect all together all right stop do understand again the opening essence of this interaction what you feel you are contributing is vital for the expansion of the interaction and your judging that is building into your decision in a sense to not trust who you are or to trust that you could actually be extraneous in the process which is impossible so therefore how you can approach it to embrace your input regardless of what it is still allowing the communications to flow freely you can have an opinion about it without coloring it do you understand and one more question um i was writing in the car this week with my son and i i can't experience an open of reality quite a bit lately which is fascinating oh not you too must be going around person i think in the car it might seem to kind of use to um not that i'm being named and i said to my 15 year old i said just look please did you see that and he said to me he says my that's in your reality that's not in my reality i'm sure like i was quite light of face shift and i was excited oh is that something you are willing to allow in other words him to maintain his own reality coexisting in the same space as you maintaining your own reality and allowing both to be valid for each of you i got lost in the excitement because i was just so excited that i know right perhaps you got found in the excitement but i understand what you are all right oh thank yourself one moment have you thanked yourself oh three questions i thank you shedding female i have a question i'm new to the group all right i really but i understand this is my first time as well so let's all proceed with the joy of this coverage so if i'm hearing everything correctly we all exist as our own universe is independent or another way all of reality exists within you including by the way your body you are fundamentally an infinite consciousness you are expressing yourself along the line for the purposes of certain advantages that that has and even your body exists within your consciousness and not the other way around yes that is my perspective at least when you talk about becoming very excited and enjoy i love himself that but then i stop myself because i don't know how relate to other people well do understand that this is generally speaking in your society a great motivator of individual to see an individual engage passionate excited and proceeding to express that fully and consciously well is it your job to make them understand or is it simply your job to be a good version of the excitement so that those who will benefit from seeing it can have a clear reflection of it what is your prescribed job description for yourself i would prefer to be who i am always with moping around for these individuals somehow assist them no but i guess i worry about relating to other people do you wish to relate to them by diminishing yourself or do you wish to relate to them by contributing what you wish to contribute allowing them to take what they will and leave what they will that approach allowing them to take whatever portions are useful and discard those which are not is the great service we are seeking and your willingness to stick to your guns allows them to seem regardless of their own set of choices my goodness there is an example of a person who proves you can actually be excited now whether they choose to create that how they feel about that whether they actually resent it is their own business but at least you give them the opportunity to see a living example why are we not learning that as children i mean why why have we not learned this going to be in them i guess i guess why are people why does somebody chosen to map that for so long well the idea is regardless of what has happened you are waking up now and you can take the sentiment behind that from this point forward to educate your children to interact with other individuals and rather than lamenting of why has this happened simply understand what has happened simply understand what changes will allow you to express it differently do that and from this point forward work that into again your approach so if you believe you will attract what you need is then to send away your sentence well you will attract what you need whether in that sense you truly understand it or not but you can be attracting support for negative decision and so it looks like adversity what it actually is is the complete fulfillment of your decision but not allowing necessarily those decisions to be conscious and preferential now by very virtue of the fact that you're even able to understand a word i am saying you are ready to begin to express this higher newer fuller degree of yourself and your willingness to stick to it allows other individuals to see allows perhaps particularly since they are so sensitive and still in perhaps a raw or state children to be very perceptive of it in particular is that clear yes very clear thank you all right i thank you in talking about the universe and and my reality being only my reality so if you look at the weather can i create a universe where the weather in my universe is what i want it to be um the example was the hurricane that was coming and um we were concerned about it because of the boaters and i have been began to have very negative things and talk about it a lot and telling to be quiet and bringing to us and that we should really start focusing on making it what we want to be so we did that and um had a bunch of people over and he told them all that the hurricane was going east and he was so positive enough that they all left and told a lot of other people in the hurricane maybe i've been telling him that we can create whatever we want in our universe and that if we want to have a universe that's ours that has the perfect weather that we enjoy that we can do it am i the next round absolutely and the idea is your weather in a sense is such a reflection it will always reinforce whatever you are explored as an individual and in fact you have seen that even can it rain on one side of the street and not the other and so i mean i started thinking about it and i'm thinking well it happens to be a world where there wouldn't be any hurt and you're a good method well first of all you are making a lot of assumptions that the idea is for now again you yes and your general vicinity you need not worry because what you call your planet your environment your atmosphere has an equilibrium and a balance that it will maintain and it can maintain it in a number of ways some as you have witnessed can be quite tumultuous others need not be but balance will be maintained and restored and do realize there are still vast unpopulated areas upon your planet then i have another or perhaps luke war follow me um and i have another thing that i've been noticing that i have like some understanding or clarification so i did have one idea that came through today i watch and i watch my family and i watch my children i watch my parents and i see patterns of behavior i see people experiencing things in one generation that another generation experiences um and i wonder how as an individual i can facilitate or interrupt that process well transform or produce an alternative rather than interrupt and the idea is again to become aware of the mechanism when a mechanism is not obvious to you you can participate in what appears to be an automatic to it an automatic presentation of it but once you begin to attract the idea that describes how the mechanism works in this case you decide who you are you trust that decision you act as though you trust that decision and you produce a result you can understand that each time an individual creates behavior that you by the way are interpreting as a pattern they are deciding all over again with what you call many past notions built into that decision but because that decision truly occurs in the moment an individual always has the immediate ability to spontaneously transform that decision and therefore the result and so simple awareness of the mechanism being willing to embody the mechanism is the strongest way to impart it to others not with an insistency that there's something wrong with them or that they must change but by the successful implementation of it and being an example of what will happen when you live this way and by the way they do not need truly to change for you to have the life that you prefer though when you do and interact with them if you remain in their vicinity you may find they will choose to pick up on many of the cues that you put out but it is not your job in that sense to worry about who they are by being the best you that you can be you give them the greatest opportunity to see alternatives that can assist them and so by being true yourself and and the you prefer to be you create change on both ends of the continuum absolutely and most immediately apparently in your own experience which others also are very quick to notice or they also assume you have patterns and when you begin to act differently and begin to get immediate different results it allows them to see even though they may strongly buy into that they are old dogs that cannot learn new tricks that hey it is possible and that is truly the most you can do for when you are willing to express who you are fully and truly are doing this fully there is no insistence that anyone need embrace who you are and in fact it is quite neutral you put it out not being hooked on any particular result you have literally finished your job by being yourself and what if you remove the responsibility of how a person must interpret what you have done you relieve yourself from a great deal of self-imposed pressure and that allows you to remain calm remain focused keep expressing yourself in integrated terms and provide an unbroken example to the others not to provide an example to them only because it is who you are but it will provide an example to them in the process absolutely does that not make sense and if not or if you can find an argument as to why that would not be by all means shared with you know i'm not the argument it sounds much clearer than what i've been doing well anything you would have said again it was a trick question i would have simply said well that's true as well which do you choose and that not does not need to seem overwhelming understand the more options that you have one way to look at it is oh my goodness i have so many options i'm so confused i can't pick or another way to look at it is the more options i have the more i'm apt to find one that's going to be precisely the one i want and sometimes the preferable options stand out even more clearly when there's a few options in there that are absolutely not preferential understand individuals will often say as one has this evening all there are voices in my head chattor in my head and one of the ways that we assist you in pivoting using this is to simply change the idea of the many voices that chatter into choices once a voice becomes a choice it is no longer something compelling it is simply an option the more options the more power the more you have to choose from the more you can make a choice that is truly representative of who you are the more you are willing to express that the more other individuals can benefit from it if they so choose and paradoxically even if they don't choose they get something out of it anyway it is the insistence that individuals have when they find something that works for them that others must change are doing it wrong have an inferior approach that results even though the thing they may be expressing is quite positive the insistence that others must also fall into place and do it that particular way is what results in what you call struggle fighting war and this type of thing the idea that you can be who you are because you have the right and the reason to be who you are and that so can they is what will allow for peace peace of mind and peace of body so therefore offering a gift with the receipt in case they wish to return it is in that sense the way to truly give yourself in an unconditional way is that clear yes and i i just wanted to say i'm thank you because um the sharing that you have done has made a great difference to me and i found the concept very important then pass yourself on the back congratulations to you for only can you first embrace and appreciate something if you contain it to begin with and so therefore you really deserve the credit oh you're welcome at this timing we will pause for a break to be determined by you and resume contact upon request
