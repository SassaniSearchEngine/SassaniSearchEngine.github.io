 All right, I'll say three things this evening of your time as you create time. How are you? Oh, thank you very much. We begin this interaction this evening of your time with the entitlement. When beginning in that sense to take back your power, to decide how you wish to live your life and begin to express that life through preference with integrity. One of the things that is most helpful is in that sense letting go of preconceived notion and in that sense loosening your grip to produce rather than a forcing and allowance, an opening up and open posture. When you begin in that sense to make such a decision to transform your life, obviously one of the notions that comes up is what do you wish in that sense to transform it to? What are your preferences? What is representative of who you choose to be? Therefore, the first shall I say step of opening up will begin by tuning in to in that sense your preferences to tuning into the energy that you produce on an emotional level which allows you to see in any given situation what is most you and what perhaps is no longer representative of who you choose to be. Therefore, one of the representations of that vibration is what you refer to colloquially as your excitement. For your excitement is that vibratory representation, the energy if you will, that tells you in any given situation that the thing that excites you the most in that moment is most you is a representation of who you chose to be. Now when you open up you can in that sense allow any factor to lead you any factor to set the tone. Many individuals in that sense will choose to open up to fear and allow that fear which is believing that a reality that you do not prefer is most likely to lead your life and that is certainly one possibility I need not tell you. However, you can begin now to tune into your excitement which is in that sense a representation of your passion, a representation of the thing in any given moment from what's available that is most representative of the thing that if you act on will give you the result that will change your life according to preference. So first of all, opening up takes the form of being cognizant of beginning to define the things that excite you for you truly deserve these things and it is now a matter of getting down to identifying them. Very often your society will seem to talk you out of many of the things that have excited you perhaps as you were growing up. Maybe saying that's irresponsible that's no way to make a living. Everyone knows that you should grow up and not do that but understand that until you believe it, until you buy into what they say everyone does not know anything. When you buy into it then yes, it seems like everyone knows this and that but there is no that's the way it is. There are in fact many that's the way it is is and you in that sense get to choose and the one that you choose, yes, will seem to present the evidence that that is the only way it is but that is the nature of beliefs. Whatever you believe, every belief system has along with it a built-in self-sustaining, self-perpetuating system of logic and system of evidence. So truly by extension, believing is seeing. You will always see it and if you shift the belief and act according to the new belief, the evidence changes and since both realities have evidence you may understand they are both true. The thing that you do not prefer is true and the thing that you do prefer is true and it is not a matter of deciding which is true, this or that, for that is a very narrow-minded approach. It is more the understanding that the truth is composed of all truths and all truths are true to those who believe them. They then again provide their own evidence which tells them it's the only way. But when you begin to see that someone else's truth is just as true, that gives you equal access to choose any truth that you prefer and by not buying into the notion that there is a truth and everything else is false, you allow yourself that many more options of things to choose from. So therefore all truths are fundamentally and foundationally true to the individuals exploring them and when you in that sense act according to a particular belief, the evidence is provided making it seem like that's the way it is and this works for all beliefs and all individuals, individuals across the board as you say. So this is automatic. Therefore perhaps the second thing that will behoove you to open up to is the things you truly believe. For many of the things that you believe you have chosen to believe, you have consciously chosen to match and create that belief in your life. But because you create the idea you call unconscious, many beliefs also will you have bought into quote unquote on faith. Perhaps because that was what you were spoon fed and perhaps because no one told you there was another option so you just assumed that is the truth, that is my belief and then by creating that belief got the evidence that that was the only way. Paradoxically you cannot change one single thing that you do believe till you first acknowledge that you believe it and this is particularly true of the beliefs which you have created or chosen unconsciously because you create the separation of them being unconscious, they are not at your disposal till you make them conscious, till you allow them to become conscious and till you allow yourself to become aware of them. Therefore the beliefs that you have which are unconscious do present themselves do you, do come to the surface and if you are open to their messenger, if you open up to the messenger of your beliefs, you can allow them one by one to spring forth to your awareness from your subconscious mind. Well how do you do this? You may ask. Good question, I'll tell you. I'll tell you all beliefs result in something you call emotion and you are quite emotional beings but perhaps have not always been taught that these emotions are always no exceptions, a result of a belief so you do not just feel that way, well I just feel that way many times individuals upon your society will say but that is not quite accurate perhaps you can fool yourself into thinking that but ultimately every emotion is the direct result of a belief, you feel that way because of something you believe. Therefore emotions themselves are a window to your beliefs and therefore a window to your liberation from unconscious beliefs that you no longer prefer and simply when you feel an emotion that is from an unpreferred belief in general by extension conveniently it will be an unpreferred emotion. Now this is where many of your society run and cower. Oh no you mean I have to feel something bad? Well the idea is this, if you are willing to feel your negative emotions rather than deny them and squelch them, yes you do have to feel them but only for a very short amount of time for when you get down to feeling your emotions and allowing yourself to express them then you are in the perfect mindset to ask yourself not now hypothetically but while you are feeling it what must I believe right now in these circumstances to feel this way. So opening up to your emotions is the allowance of those emotions again particularly ones that you do not prefer for they deliver on their wings the messages that are your beliefs so therefore when you open up to your emotions allow them through and then ask yourself what belief lies under them then the quote unquote unconsciously bought into belief gets handed to you as you say on a silver platter. It becomes most obvious in that moment that is why the emotion is created to tell you to allow you to see what you believe and once again once you acknowledge a belief and acknowledge that it is a truth and not the only truth you then equalize it to all the other options which you now lay before you when you deny that when you say well here I feel a negative emotion what must I believe I must believe this particular negative thing oh I would never believe that oh anyone who believes that is very bad no way you deny that emotion you deny that belief and you talk it back into the subconscious when you acknowledge in that sense the belief well I would prefer not to believe this I would prefer no one did but obviously I do believe it you are now back in what you call the driver's seat you now can change that belief but only because you have allowed yourself to acknowledge it acknowledgement liberates your unconscious belief denial tucks them back in and by the way they then come back knocking louder for you cannot ultimately for very long deny what is inside of yourself it grows nastier uglier noisier and eventually will come in some unpreferred form that you will address it so your willingness to begin to dive into addressing your beliefs again in the form of negative emotions allows you to see an interesting thing that occurs once you are willing to feel the anger feel the fear feel whatever negative emotion that you create and again it has you the belief you generally get to a point now that you've dived into it where you simply go well now what it is not that the emotion ever continues to grow and overbear you only doesn't seem to do so when you deny it or you deny it's underlying belief so in acknowledging in calling forth a belief that an emotion represents the whole of that emotion begins to loosen for that is again why the emotion has been created by you and when you use your creations in a positive way they have no reason to hang around after that they have played out their purpose so your willingness to feel these negative emotions and trace them back to the belief actually allows you to end cycle on feeling your willingness to say well that couldn't be me on beyond that again tucks it back in the form of denial and again you will get to look at it again some other time in a nastier form as you open up to your emotions as you open up to your thoughts for they often will be generated from such emotions and trace back to the belief the last thing that is left to open up to is what you call your actions for your beliefs create emotions and thoughts and with that foundational prism you then act you do something you perform an action in your reality that action will always be tainted if it is again a negative belief but somehow will reflect in either a blatant or subtle way the underlying belief emotion and thought never again do you act in a vacuum or do anything in a vacuum there is always a foundation so obviously if you have a negative belief yielding a negative emotion yielding a negative thought the actions that you perform will have a negative foundation and cannot help but again blatantly or subtly come out as negative actions in a physical world which is where you choose to exist actions are actually what create the reality physically so therefore belief emotion and thought are the foundation and action is the midwife that brings in that reality and you always again as you always feel what you believe you always act according to what you truly believe so beginning to open up to your actions how am i acting in a particular circumstance again particularly when you are not acting according to your preference can also be traced back to a belief now this is what liberates you from your unpreferred beliefs opening up to them in the form of emotion thoughts and actions but where you transform them having acknowledged them is by opening up to the actions performed from the old negative belief which is again what creates your life you may now that you are equalizing the old unpreferred belief by acknowledging it call up the new preferred belief and the new preferred belief when you even stated with your eyes closed perhaps sitting still and quiet you can begin to get a sense of how it feels because again all beliefs yield an emotion even if you are only trying them on so you can literally conjure up the feeling by simply stating the belief that you prefer having acknowledged the old belief that you no longer do when you state the new belief and begin to feel it and project in your imagination very clearly how one with the new belief would act if you open up to those actions which will be absolutely different obviously from the actions of the negative belief you now have in front of you a mole a model choice a negative actions according to the negative belief and choice b positive actions according to the new preferred positive belief when you go through the process of allowing yourself rather than being automatic to begin to assess this mechanism and lie side by side the actions of the unpreferred belief to the actions of the new preferred belief it is not shall i say a great difficulty in choosing the positive actions for now that you have show yourself that there is an alternative now that you have seen that your actions were the result of an unpreferred belief now that you called forth the preferred belief and again see it no uncertain terms that the actions of the preferred belief are different it is not that difficult to choose the actions of the preferred belief because now that you have given yourself the advantage of acknowledging them as an option they are far more representative the new actions according to the new beliefs of the you you say you prefer to be so going through this particular process if you wish to call it that will always give you two sets or two courses of action and again one will be preferable to the other so it will be no big choice to make and this is how you create your reality you believe you feel you think you act you're already doing this again the negative unpreferred beliefs are yielding negative unpreferred actions which are creating negative unpreferred results this is nothing you need master your experts believe me therefore now if you wish to master anything else you can master performing making yourself aware of first and then performing the new preferred actions which again by extension can only yield at least a different result in the same quote unquote seeming same circumstance so your opening up takes the form of becoming aware of what you already believe feel think and act and becoming aware of what you wish to believe how that would feel how one would think and act with that belief providing options providing alternatives which again then are not difficult to choose again I remind you this can be greatly simplified by simply in any given moment allowing yourself to factor out things that are not available to act upon in that moment pushing them aside leaving them for later and seeing what is right in front of you in any given moment what's right here what's right here what's right in front of my face and choosing from those options the choice the option that excites you the most that you can act upon with integrity this will change the face of your life without the process and the opening up process will simply then be automatic you will simply in the perfect timing have particular negative feelings which will then be the perfect timing to trace them back to the beliefs reassign new beliefs reassign new actions perform the new actions and get the new reality you are right there right there at the precedent of changing your reality and even being able to understand a single word that is translating through the channel allows you to know that you are capable of this now lastly before we proceed to interact openness being open is an advantage what you call God what we call all that is what sometimes will be referred to as the universe or infinite creation in that sense always provides to you what you truly feel you believe and deserve to have and therefore a posture of openness ultimate willing to be completely open therefore results in the universe withholding nothing from you it is a point of power many individuals in your society will equate that degree of openness to what you call in a negative sense vulnerability but under that vulnerability need not mean in any way shape or form weakness it can simply represent your willingness to be completely open to the universe and again I remind you the universe then withholds nothing from you only will that degree of openness be perceived as weakness if you believe that again something that you do not prefer can slip in there and get you and the bottom line is you are the entire universe ultimately metaphysically speaking you are the cause of causes there is no outside and therefore there is no outside for something to sneak in from and get you it is all within you you have the perception and one of the explorations of physical reality is that your soul is within your body but from our perspective and our knowledge and understanding this is completely reverse of the actual shall I say mechanism of creation for literally literally your body is within your consciousness not the other way around your body is but a point a pinpoint in that way of your consciousness itself so from that perspective you truly created all and from that perspective anything that you perceive to be external is still within you and therefore from your point of view a reflection of something within you therefore you can use all the various reflections in your reality in a positive way some will align you in the aspect that you will agree with them and they will assist you in defining who you are by reinforcing who you are but some of the external reflections will in that sense allow you to define yourself through what you call opposites or by showing you an example of something that you absolutely are not and therefore though you do not usually interpret it this way is of service to you by again aligning you to who you are with a dynamic tension in that case by providing an example of who you are not but however that allows for self-definition as well so no matter who you interact with and whatever you do it is always of service to you and it always assists you in defining and reinforcing your definition of who you are again either by agreement or by complete antithesis but everything is of service to you and again since it is all within you you may wish you may just wish to begin to approach it from that perspective as reflections as part of you as gifts that are being offered to you again sometimes ones which will support your viewpoint and others which will in a sense seem to run opposite to it but that again allows you to define yourself that is what you call anger for anger is simply a momentary rush of alignment when you in that sense interact with the reflection that is indicative in no uncertain terms of who you are not and in that sense it is then of service to you true anger only lasts 10 to 15 of your second that feeling that rush of alignment again is of service to you in your self-definition beyond the 10 to 15 seconds in general individuals in your society have been brought up with a tendency to spend then many successive minutes perhaps you can say sometimes hours, days, weeks or years invalidating and judging the thing which is not representative of who you are and that is why what you call anger seems in that sense to last so long but if you truly in that sense count to 10 that is where that expression comes from that will in general play out the amount of time by which you can realize that that rush of alignment has been of service to you and perhaps you can say cut yourself off at the path at invalidating the thing that is not representative of who you are for just as denial invalidating something that you do not prefer does not give it less weight it gives it more weight by placing more attention upon it invalidating or judging a symbol does not give it less weight in your life or less effect on you it gives you more effect more weight and you will never truly in that sense transform anything by continuing to judge it you can in that sense validate realities which you do not prefer without condoning them in other words you can say all right that is not my exploration a matter of fact it's nothing like my exploration I would never do that but obviously they have the right and reason to exist as well they although I can imagine what are exploring something from some level so I will allow them to explore that and that is the extent of the shall I say tone with which you then validate them with but again you can validate something without condoning it allowing something to exist on its own and not interacting with it is not condoning it it is validating it where you condone an action is when you perform a similar action so if you in a sense find that someone is doing something that is not representative of who you are and you are willing to validate it as a reality and then not do that thing for any reason even if it's just to show them then you are validating that point of view without condoning the moment you act that way again no matter what your rationale is well I'll show them how it feels so they'll never do that again the moment you show them you are being them you are condoning that action and you can begin now through this realization to simply validate all realities and only condone only act according to the ones that are representative of who you are this form of opening up particularly what we have just discussed the latter portion is the key to what you call peace upon your planet for it is not the fact that you have many different ideologies in and of itself that creates warfare it is the mutually exclusive element saying that this is the way the only way and no other way have the right to exist that creates that friction that creates that war if there were only one way there would only be one person and in looking around obviously this is not so each person is a way is a path a path is not something you are on a path is something you are and always shall be so therefore beginning to validate the realities of others beginning to validate the belief that you used to have or that you are finding no longer serve you gives you equal access to all other reality validation is the key to equalization validating your beliefs that you no longer prefer and validating the realities of others that you no longer prefer without condoning them these are the simple keys to beginning to embody inner peace beginning to embody peace of mind peace can only be achieved through the love of peace itself for peace from the perspective of hating war is matching the vibration of hate and in fact by extension matching the vibration of war itself so by loving that aspect embodying that aspect and providing through opening up to action a living example of a person who is now willing to express their great power in this way begins to allow you to be the initial examples upon your planet not to mention creates a life of ecstasy for you in the process so I assume there is some attraction to what I am saying our particular society functions in this way and we in that sense have complete intercooperation in fact to the point where now we no longer have the need for what you colloquially refer to as privacy and our society expresses itself no longer through what you call language but through tell empathic connection tell empathic empathy empathy which is vibrating as someone else so closely matching their vibration so closely that you begin to create similar thoughts at the same time that is the mechanism that you call telepathy but it is the form of empathy and thus we rename it tell empathy our society functions in this way because again we are willing to look at the reality of others that do not correspond to our choices without invalidating them and simply going on about our way with the things that are representative of who we are as you do this you attract other individuals who are now representative of the new belief and many times either your old friends will begin to seem to change as they too will be willing to match this or they will in a sense begin to disappear into the woodwork as you redefine who you are as you redefine your inner self the outer reflection then changes to follow suit and always again is in this way believing seeing it always has been it always will be if one of the things that you believe is that seeing is believing that is why you get that effect and that is one of the things you are taught upon and in your society but the adverse is no less true you are living examples of it and as you change your beliefs and act according to the new preferred beliefs so will you too see what I am saying only you can prove it to yourself only you upon being so willing can open up to who you are and express who you are throughout your life we wish now to thank you all for participating in this co-created interaction with us this evening of your time it brings us great joy to function literally as ambassadors from our civilization and in allowing you and the ground roots level to act as ambassadors from your civilization as well I thank you express my unconditional love and appreciation and ask you now how I may be of service to you shut it hey when you're planted it must be fun to have sex is there any other way I mean the idea is many of the mores social mores that surround that symbol in your society do not exist within our own so therefore since everything that we do from moving our little finger to as you say having sex is a complete and committed act there are no if you'll part of the expression half-assed actions in our society we are always in that sense completely committed to whatever we are doing for it is always a direct expression of who we choose to be this bit about excitement that we share is simply our automatic way of living and in a sense required observing your society to understand where you were not doing this automatically at first this was not apparent to us such as it an automatic way of life for us but again because you can understand this because when I say it you feel well that would be nice that tells you you contain it for only can you understand something if you first contain was there a specific question that you have yes do you have you have physical sex to read produce it was shall we say much more prevalent in our past now the act is more of an exchange of energy as we are also perhaps you can say evolving so to speak into a more non physical existence however again historically speaking it was much the same as your own without perhaps again many of the more raised attached it was always a complete commitment it was always a complete sharing between two individuals and it was always a complete expression of two complete individuals creating a greater whole not two individuals feeling incomplete attracting each other out of those feelings of incompleteness and attempting to complete each other through the act now so there is a difference in how it is perceived but again you would perceive historically it occurring in much the same way with much the same anatomy is that well now now you do it now it is far more than energy exchange as we shall I say as you as a society begin to evolve from limited master of limitation physicality to more of a limit less physical beginning now individually and society to see what you can still do in your creatorhood while still remaining physical my society is beginning to shall I say border non physical the first level if you will of experiencing existence as non physical beings so therefore part of the symptom of this in my society is beginning to no longer rely on external symbology therefore rather than quote unquote eating we will now exchange energy directly with our environment this is a relatively recent development however we still maintain the ability to perform the physical act and from time to time we'll choose to do so for specific reasons because again as you evolve you do not lose the ability to experience something you used to be able to create so we will tap into it here and there now and then but far more are beginning to rely on inner resources rather than outer reality now one of the things that you are doing as a society is beginning to realize that the outer reality is a reflection of you but still use that outer reality since you created it and now you realize what it is and where it is from you can begin to play with it and have fun with it we are perhaps you can say just beginning to pass by that idea and beginning to explore non physicality altogether was this clear yes in the in biblical times it's a merry was with child without having sex that's possible with that absolutely it is quite rare upon your planet but it is absolutely and that is in a sense a version of what I am saying where there has been an energy exchange that has a physical analog good example will that do yes we thank you shut up hey man you read a lot about you were full of duchess and articles on running aliens running tests on the human stuff do you have anything to say about that first of all we prefer the terminology detainment for they are just that temporary detainment no one is whisked away and not brought back understand that again as I have shared at the beginning of this interaction that you create your reality and you do so either consciously or unconsciously certain of the agreements that you have made prior to this life you will often choose to have remained unconscious agreements any individual upon your planet that is interacting with such entities which do exist physically although they also exist out of phase with your physical reality as well have done so by choice now again from the perspective of many of their lives since they do not realize consciously that they create their own reality they have denied and forgotten the choice and do not act as though it is a choice when this perspective is assumed by an individual then the playing out of the agreement takes the form of happening to them for it is not even a notion that everything happens from them that this must be one of the things they agree to and therefore they act out of fear and that fear will produce physical pain from what you call the various procedures understand that there are many other individuals who have been having such interaction since childhood who have never filed it in the negative draw have filed it as a positive very personal experience they also are detained in similar manner certain observations and shall I say perhaps you can say procedures are performed and they simply with no pain allow the exchange understanding that they are providing something to these being that those beings in return are providing something back though perhaps that will be perceived as mental and these are the individuals that because they generally have filed it as positive and private are not on all one don't you the ones who are in fear and the ones who have not even entertained the possibility that they must have agreed to it so now they can look at why they did so again through that fear tend to speak much more loudly tend to in that sense attract other individuals to speak of this too so overwhelmingly your society's notions of these interactions come from the fearful individuals now this society has been interacting with your society for many years your government has been aware of them since your 1947 year and in that sense they mean no harm they are in that sense utilizing particular genetic material again by agreement so many will not admit this and are doing no harm to the individuals in the process the individuals who are in deep denial and in that sense experiencing this in the form of victimhood through that self-judgment through that judgment of the agreement through the friction of all these conflicting ideas creates a very pain create the very mental anguish that you hear from our perspective that is never the result of the interaction only the denial of the participant of their agreement does this make sense yes oh is there something else specific that you wish to discuss along these lines uh along another line i'd like to discuss different incarnations that one soul would have different lifetimes is there a way of of connecting those or tapping into another another for instance if if you lived if you were reincarnated obviously is there a way to tap into the previous life and learn something from that well absolutely well however allow me to explain something that perhaps is not taught in your society you have all in this room lived thousands of lives upon your planet not just a few not just three or four therefore yes there is the availability of a plethora of information from what you generally refer to as your over soul or higher self however being that the last 25 000 year cycle upon your planet had been the exploration of limitation negativity and functioning as though you are completely separate from what you call god or all that is many of the explorations many of the experiences of perhaps you can say most of those lives are completely irrelevant in a lifetime that is exploring expansion that is exploring limitlessness now again having lived thousands of lives they were not all lives of complete limitation and suffering many of them also had such exploration beginning to open up to spirituality beginning to open up to self-empowerment so therefore your perception that you have only lived a few lives is due to the fact that those few lives that you may perceive are relevant had similar explorations to the life you are living now so yes you can tap into them but it is not something that requires effort for as you explore something and simply in a meditative state close your eyes and blank the screen of your imagination periods in your historical timing that are relevant will come to the surface will come to mind and you can tap into in a sense what you are doing in a particular life if what you were doing is similar to what you are doing now that is the only way there will be any bleed through and any sense to be made of it again if it is a life that was so much different from the life you are leading now it would simply make no sense within the framework of who you are so you can tap into them they are again usually the ones that are representative of what you are exploring now and where you find yourself strongly attracted either to a people to a land to a place to a particular shall i say sacred site these ideas will cue you into what connections you have that are relevant and then if it is a physical place or a physical person then connecting with that place physically or with that person physically will generally in that sense create a conducive enough commonality in this life to have aspects of that life which will be of assistance to you in this life come through now one more idea when you speak of incarnating as a soul who lives a life is born gets old dies reincarnated born gets old and dies that is only one way of thinking about it and one way of experiencing from the perspective of what you call your over soul or higher self that is not the way it is perceived by your higher self from your point of view physical point of view there is linear notion linear timing and the linear playing out of what you call before during and after from the perspective of your higher self all lives everything all everything all together is simultaneous no timeline to stretch it out upon it all exists in an ever existing eternal now moment where everything is simultaneously occurring so from the perspective of your physical self reincarnation from the physical from the perspective of your higher self it is multiple simultaneous incarnations so one other idea in connecting with these ideas is that you need go nowhere from the perspective of your higher self it is all happening right now and you need not retrieve something simply tap into a bleed through where what is happening right now can be perceived by you right now for the commonality in all lives and in all existences that do not even contain the definition of lives is what you call the now moment you always exist in the now moment you only ever have you from the now moment create a notion of a path a notion of a future but you truly only live right here and right now so right here and right now are your nexus points are your connections to many of these ideas is this of service oh thank you as well other male are we not someone that is by the negative a collective negative belief systems along those around us only to the degree that you accept them only to the degree that on some level you buy into them then feel that way think that way and act that way to hear you therefore you actually have an option that many of you have not pondered and that is to only experience positive results you are in a world of polarity which involves positive and negative when you expand your consciousness within a given reality by definition your awareness of everything expands including the negative but awareness of and experience of are two completely different things you only experience something when you act according to that premise if you see negativity in someone else validated but do not condone it you act according to your preference you can be aware of negativity even more aware of it but only through others and not need to experience there is a belief that many individuals buy into that in order to appreciate or even have the ability to even discern what happiness is you must do so against the backdrop of continuing and repetitive sadness and misery and that is simply a belief therefore because it is only a belief that you must balance positive with negative you only get that effect when you act with that expectancy you can in that sense be willing to be more aware of negativity and positivity through your expansion again in the form of awareness but not in the form of experience now as i say this if you find yourself saying yeah sure then you are identifying a belief within is this a story yes but as it has a talent path a creature who can feel the negative belief systems of others and those negative belief systems can impinge on the nervous system no no who told you that that is a belief which yes has evidence which will accompany it but that is not the way it is that is a way that it is in other words i may be aware of negativity that individuals are exploring in your reality but i do not feel that negativity because it is not my belief so therefore i have an awareness of it but it has no effect on me and in fact many times my particular orientation is so positive in terms of belief emotion thought and action that i merely take your word about the negativity upon your planet for i have no experiential choice of feeling it and therefore i always see you from the empowered viewpoint i always see you as exploring negativity because you have enough power to even begin to think about exploring it and i will never therefore feel sorry or sympathy which will drag me down or affect my vibes as you say i will simply in that sense see you from the empowered viewpoint and again perhaps admire many of your courage to the degree and the extent that you are willing to explore experience of negativity but that need not in a sense have any effect on me until i say so then it does so it can and binge if you contain that as a notion or you can simply maintain a compassionate awareness of it without it affecting you because you are too busy generating the alternative which is then of service to other individuals who may wish to see that reflection do proceed if this is not clear it is clear um it doesn't sound too simple or too good to be true really in living in this environment and and in having had the belief system that i was open invulnerable to this environment and in feeling the pain that exists in this environment is the result of that you can only feel the pain if you contain a belief that would allow you to feel that pain so therefore if someone else is creating negativity and you perceive it and you feel it the point there is that there is an issue in that for you and that you are now giving yourself an opportunity very creatively through an external circumstance you labeled them to see a belief that perhaps you have not looked at within yourself but when you truly are clear what you believe when you have acknowledged all the negative beliefs that no longer serve you and replace them with positive beliefs you will no longer match that feeling that they have with the same feeling for your interpretation your perceptive system will now be retuned for positive in that sense experience so if you do feel this it is simply again an advantage an opportunity for you to see where that applies to you once again allow me to say this you are the universe everything within it is you therefore you do not literally feel someone else's energy you create your own version of that energy and express and experience that so even when you say well if I feel your energy no you are matching my energy you can only feel your own energy so again allow this to be a window to your soul a window to the belief that you still contain that you no longer prefer and again many times one of those beliefs will be well everyone has to have some negative experience to balance out the positive and it's all right to believe that you cannot change it till you acknowledge that you do and you cannot acknowledge that you believe anything till you realize it's all right to believe that is this getting to the issue yes but you you just grind a process in your world where you and another true telepathic experience actually unite on the level of experience and share the identical experience hey but perhaps what I left out with that not one single individual upon my whole planet chooses to experience negativity so they are simply gradient variances of positive experience and that is what allowed us to become telepathic but for I mean are there none of us on this planet who are capable of experiencing another experience directly again no you create your version of it and the more accurately you do that the more it seems that way but that is the extent of it as I had began by saying telepathy is not reading someone else's mind it is empathically connecting with them so much that you function and identify completely as them and when you function completely as them you create similar thoughts at the same time your energy your thoughts but from a similar foundational perspective they can seem to be the same this is very often exhibited in individuals upon your planet that you say are in love where they seem to know what each other are about to say they are so in synchronous harmonic vibrational resonance that they create similar thoughts at the same time and this is always the mechanism and knowing this gives you power whereas thinking that they can impinge on you create an excuse not to exhibit that power a very sound excuse but an excuse no one from the overall fundamental foundational viewpoint that you created all which you do you your powers of creation are so vast though this makes down paradoxical that you can actually create the appearance that you don't create it at all but that is not lack of power that is complete power and the complete courage to play out that reality do proceed if this is not clear I mean I just if people in love can do that in the positive realm I mean if you're walking down the street and people are walking by you when you're feeling their habits and you're feeling their energies and you're feeling the essence of what makes them individuals I don't know if you are positively oriented then you will not feel their negativity as negativity you will sense their negativity you will sense their interpretation of it but you will provide yourself with your own interpretation of it which will generally again if you are functioning from the positive perspective be an empowering notion as to why they have the right the reason and the complete strength to create that negativity but until you match it you do not feel it and when you feel it you are matching it from within in my language I think of that as taking it personally in what way um did it somehow a reflection in taking it on or taking it personally or taking it as something which denied my own experience or my own oh no and if in that sense that is your perception then allow us to clarify what you are saying is what is true for you what I am saying is no better than what you are saying and I am not in that sense attempting to convince you about what I am saying what I am sharing with you is an alternative way of looking at it where you won't get the effect of someone else dragging you down with their energy and when you in that sense maintain a positive perspective you are then more able to be of service to them if it is a notion that you wish to be of service to them to begin with we are not invalidating your process and saying that it is untrue by any means we are simply clarifying and explaining our own against the backdrop of your own and giving you a choice when you choose to perceive what you are perceiving obviously as we have shared in acting that way you will get blatant evidence that that is a truth a very valid truth a very valid way to look at it what we are providing is another valid truth to ponder and decide which one is representative of who you are. So then what is the stop on from having for example having a thin kind of interaction that you have and that's not any kind of what is there should be no limitations to that where you know we can we can engage in totally positive telepathic communication with others on our fund? Well the idea is that you can't and as you begin to function from the positive perspective because you can only experience a reality that you are the vibration of you begin to draw from your population other individuals of like mind and as in that sense you attract individuals willing to explore that vibratory presentation then you will express and experience that with them but ultimately mass on mass as a society this is many years off into your future for many individuals they will choose to represent and explore negative experience in no uncertain terms. So just to clarify the mechanics of being aware of other people's limitations without being limited by other people's limitations could you clarify? You simply in that sense make note of what it is you feel is their limitation and then go about your business without being the same way therefore you are validating their reality and providing a positive alternative that positive alternative is a beacon which again attracts other individuals of like mind you create a nucleus and in that nucleus begin to express ahead of the timing of the rest of your society versions of this telepathic ability but right now what is perhaps you can say a main consideration to individuals upon your planet being that they deny much of the beliefs within them is what you call privacy so as the need and the desire for privacy remains individuals will not allow themselves to open up to that type of telepathic connection where they are afraid to face many of the things within themselves let alone let someone else in to see them. I have a few other questions. What we will do is allow some others to ask and then come back to you for continuity but please hold them we wish in that sense to interact again. All right. Sure. From your perspective is there a difference between belief systems and a few things? If it can be interchangeable but again this is semantic for as you in that sense have a belief system in general you can also break it down as a gradient of opinions being expressed from the perspective of that belief system so it simply depends what you are asking. Okay. I've been in a situation at work where someone who sits very close to me he has some very interesting conversations we also have very divergent things belief systems and very different perspectives on things and he stated on a couple of occasions and no one certain turns that he believes that his way is the way that things should be and if other people can't toe the line according to what he believes then too bad and if they should you know even die or whatever the result that's just their tough luck. Well again this is the attitude that we have shared that results in warfare. However you're now in a unique position where you can actually demonstrate that not only are you willing to accept the reality of others although again perhaps not condoning it but you are even willing to accept the reality of others that are not willing to accept your reality and this again provides an example in no uncertain terms in a blatant way do that individual regardless of the fact that he may never in this life choose it at least shows him that such a thing exists and can work as an alternative as an option. Do you find yourself however in fisting your viewpoint upon him? No. I feel very passionate about my belief and I felt really willing to accept it which I think in my work environment for me there is a certain feeling of vulnerability there and it felt really good to do that anyway you know to feel vulnerable and be very clear about who I was anyway. I guess what I'm asking about between belief systems and opinions is that questioning him further about like why he has this particular opinion and what he bases it on it there was very little factual he was very unaware of the fact of the situation that he was had such an opinion on and I can respect his rights to have opinions but and his own belief and they can certainly be different from mine. Where does the butt come in? Well when opinions are formed without the knowledge of the situation that they're pointed out. Well that is your perception of his knowledge of his situation which obviously differs from his own perception. The point is are you willing to validate one who even from your perspective does that it is perfectly fine for him to explore. Now you too in a sense can mirror back to him saying things that you cannot substantiate and know nothing about or can simply in interacting with him maintain your consistency of knowing about what you speak to again to provide another perspective to him but never can you force him to change his point of view that in a sense is not even the point. So are you willing to simply maintain who you are interact with him to the degree that you wish to and then in that sense when it is no longer relevant not need to insist on your point of view for again if you believe in the power of it you simply stated as a gift with no insistence that anyone need taken. Where is it hanging up for? I get them hanging up because his belief system is mutually exclusive and yours is not. No I guess because I feel that for one person to say that their way is the only way and that everybody else's stuff is it better to inform her own. Those people tend to find each other then they become a group of people who think that anybody else has to do their do things their way. Well in general they then attract another group of people not their way with a similar notion and in that sense create what you consider conflict but is that really your business or is your business to be who you choose to be interact with that individual to the extent where you feel in that sense excited to do so and then allow him to create his reality and again assuming that your reality does not contain those definitions perhaps you will then not be interacting in proximity with him to that degree and simply be again attracting your group which will show you that always can exist simultaneously. Well I sit right in front of me so I hear this a lot on a day to day basis. Well I'm going to get it started to be a mythic site. You had mentioned before about the dynamic tension that's created when there's a disagreement between belief systems and I'm finding that a lot and I see the service that it is for me because it allows me to really define myself as you said but um another book. Another book yeah it's I think I've gotten the message and I'd like to move this one place. Also it's not quite a dynamic. Oh well sometimes it can be as mundane as simply requesting a change in seat but perhaps you can also understand that perhaps there is some unfinished business. Perhaps you have not given yourself the opportunity to maintain your center in that situation till there's no longer a charge on it till it no longer matters it is simply who he is and who you are. So perhaps there is still a little bit more there to work out. Okay. Is there something else? Um not really. I have other questions but I have other questions. We thank you. Shut up. Hey um I went back to a previous slide too and we discussed this before and uh and I found out I was carrying forward guilt. Well that was your interpretation of it through which we then provided a tool but do proceed. Yes. In that sense you only match that guilt create that feeling here and now or again the path that no hold on you the present is not even experientially a result of the path and only do you feel an effect from the path when you match it or recreate it right now right here the only time the only place there ever is but anyway since you had created that shall I say convenient convention we simply played through it to allow yourself to deliver a message to yourself. Now what have you done and how has this been a service to you? Well I found myself I didn't want this guilt and here I was creating it again so I took another look at it and I realized I said I I know what to be guilty but yeah I recognize I was being guilty feeling that way and then I turned around and said well I didn't if I want something different I didn't say what it is I want to be different at so I I defined it a new preferential person would be someone with integrity you see but I have no guilt that's brandon saying I'm not guilty by any guilt. What is your definition of guilt? Doing something wrong? Well judging yourself for having done something or something and in the process of judging yourself in that moment not unconditionally loving yourself for unconditional love means no conditions and judgment is the imposition of condition so in the moment you are feeling quote unquote guilt you are not unconditionally loving yourself and while you are then placing blame and judgment there is nothing to reconcile you are in the process of experiencing blame and judgment. What will allow you to re-center yourself is again the reminder that judgment is conditional love and the willingness to re-insert unconditional love which then takes the form of forgiveness retaining remaining restating that unconditional love and moving forward if you feel a particular way again allowing that feeling to deliver the belief. Now what is the belief behind the guilt? In this life right now it is in that sense the overall subject of integrity and in that sense do you feel here and now that you still in that sense still function not entirely in your own integrity. Perhaps before you answer I will say that that is my perception and that is where it comes into the here and now and that is where you give yourself the opportunity to say all right all right all right I've had enough of this I am no longer choosing to act out of integrity I acknowledge that I have I forgive myself for having done so and will no longer do so get back into the moment and from this now moment create who you prefer to be which is an individual who understands that everything is one expression an integrated whole and integrity is treating everything with that integrated perspective. Now when you do that and as you have done that is it even possible to then feel the guilt? No. Oh is there something else? Oh at this time we will pause for a short break of 10 to 15 minutes of your counting and resume contact at that time.
