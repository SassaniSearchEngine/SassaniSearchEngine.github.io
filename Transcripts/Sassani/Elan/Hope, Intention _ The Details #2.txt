 Very often, in what would appear to be the most mundane of happiness, great and overwhelming knowledge can be transformed. It is your willingness to shall we say nurture the childlike fascination within you that allows you to approach everything with that fascination and therefore allows you in maintaining an expectance, ease and overall positive expectance, and not a rigid expectation allows the situation on the path of least resistance to deliver its jewel. What was happening the most from me last night was fear. Fear for my inner child, you know, the child within, which is so symbolic, you know, as I just came, I was really getting up to a depth the most so the fear got in the way and I, you know, wanted to see balls of fire and things in front of me. But you're right because as soon as I acknowledged the little things like drops of water dripping on my head, for instance, I, you know, felt more aware of what was going on there. You know, if it happened to it that I heard flapping of wings, like let's say when a medium sized bird, like a dove or a pigeon take off and there were no birds in the cave that I heard that and that could be bad, you know, they weren't that. And also, it was, word, I had to it for four hours and it's hit star in black and it's very, it's a powerful thing to do. Perhaps in a sense, symbolically, you may understand you had a, all right, liberal usage of your language, a womb without a view. Oh, thank you. Feel free to. Okay. One of the energies that I'm going to need to ask you about is that I was feeling a lot of dolphin energy once again. I had visions in this blackness of glittering oceans and dolphins playing the ocean. You know, I've seen a documentary a few nights before. It might have spurred that on, but I did feel that. Well understand the acceptability of that energy when felt to very easily being tapped into. So perhaps rather than blaming the documentary, simply understand that that is what you chose to attract when you were in a very receptive and open state completely unaware of what to expect. Thank you. Thank you. So, also I come to the realization that something is, it's so big, it's so close in the front of my face that I'm not, I won't let myself see it. I won't let myself remember these experiences because I believe that something big is going on in my life right now. Oh, well, in my hands, in my, you know, if you were to define what that something might be, what would it be? A transformation. Oh. But perhaps that will do and you need not make it so mysterious. Yes. So can I ask some questions about the cave? You could ask briefly. Am I the only one who is visiting this chamber? Perhaps in this time, here we are, however, there have been many over the many, shall we say, agents that it has existed. Okay. And perhaps, again, another way to approach this would be for now one of the only visitors from your direct dimension of experience. But since this will represent an overlapping vibrational resonance, you may understand that perhaps you can say other individuals are visiting them from other dimensional experiences and sometimes what you would perceive as a site or a sound. Yes, definitely. And you mentioned that it has an extraterrestrial overton when they built it. And I'm wondering, who exactly are the D.C.s? Well, there are more than one, shall we say, raised with a technology that can act that the vibrational resonance of the chamber? It's not serious energy. There is a very strong connection with that energy. I got that. But in general, you will not have direct craft from that civilization being that they are primarily now non- Yeah, I understand that. I got that from my dream, the first time I went in that night when I dreamt. I don't know where I got it from, but it was this serious energy. I was just going to do it with breeze and I'll leave it at that. You are doing just fine. Yeah, you're wearing it. So in order to seek a certain specific energy, what could that be? Well, first of all, while in the chambers, again, a conducive atmosphere for vibrational resonance itself, did you ask her any notes? Yes. Vibrate, saying perhaps, or what you say, or sometimes called own. Yes, I mean, you think you're saying it out there right now. Yeah. Then I will, in that sense, understand that you did. What did you then find as a response? Last time I got an echo and I didn't get an echo this time, I just found myself coming to myself, vibrating among us. No, I felt physical. I felt hard as a rock. I felt very still in parallax and hard as a rock. Will also understand that having had gotten what you call an echo and then doing a similar thing and getting seemingly no echo is, in that sense, a result as well. That symphony of my body and that harmony was frightening in a way. Well, in a sense, it was more a result of your own contraction in what you would call the expression of the people. Sibley, free, deep breaths and the re-establishment and restatement of your clear intention can be all that is necessary to begin to then flow and become more fluid and less contracted. Do you feel that there's a healing energy there? I went there to, I hurt my hands and I need to tap into that and I went there for that reason. Well, do understand and we have discussed this many times before, that you always do the healing. That particular circumstance will perhaps magnify and mirror back to you certain ideas within you. If healing is what you are concentrating on, it can have the effect of enhancing and magnifying the effect. But that is simply, again, because you then enhance and magnify your expectancy. So there are high possibilities there that I can... If you wish to apply it in that way, you will find great success. What you are doing to healing and utilizing what you have created within your reality to do so, at least understand that fundamentally. Is there anything that you could advise me on as far as searching for other chambers along that line, as far as like, you know, literally north and south of this area? Perhaps not so much finding other areas but another simple suggestion. Do you have what you call a small drum or perhaps... Bongo? No, that's the thing. You may find that the playing of such a type of instrument within that chamber will also result in what you sometimes call déjà vu or a percent of a connection. To their local chambers? Do some degree yes, but also to what you sometimes colloquially will call path-like connection in this case. Though we generally refrain from removing you from this particular life's focus, in this case you will again echo and mirror back something which you can then use in this one. Yeah, that's what I'm seeking from what I can... How I can use it in this line. It's so important to me now. So can I ask about the stick that I have? Last question, yes. Yes, this is last question. Do you have anything to comment about? I found it stuck in the ground, I showed it to Andrew, and it was stuck in the ground at the entrance to the chamber. It's really unusual and it means a lot to me most importantly. And it's symbolic, I guess, it's women's spirit stick to me. In a sense, yes. Perhaps more than something that will support you in that sense, being that it is quite frail in that way, you may simply understand it to be a sad representative of your power itself. Power in grounding but also power in connecting with the higher realm. How does the ball act like that could be a sense, yes? In a sense, yes. But again, if you will connect with it physically while meditating, it will in a sense seem to speak or perhaps seem to be. Okay, great. Thank you very much. And for your willingness to explore the depth of your consciousness and come up, my... Thank you. Thank you. A lot. Be right. Be right. Thank you. I have another question from... Let me just put it on. In my vision that I'm having currently about teaching the children the balls of light, the holographic light, I'm very excited about it. And I just... Oh, are they, by the way? They. The children? Oh, okay. Two questions about it. How can I access the balls of light now in my own energy field? And how can I assist the brain of this technology? Well, question or shall I say answer one will also be answered. In a relaxed state, I open, manifest through your imagination as visually as possible such a ball, perhaps a first signal seems to theory or ghost-like, but you will begin to notice it taking on a seemingly more solid appeal. So you will literally be mid-wiping that style of energy into your physical reality. That will be the answer to bold questions. But once you begin to whatever degree to connect with that symbol, then it will be more accessible to utilize in this reality. Okay, just meditate on the... Eyes open and allow it to begin to perhaps in a sense, crystallize into your reality. Understand that it is right there and simply begin to allow yourself to have the eyes to see. In other words, this is already here. These balls of light are already here. Well, if you will look at it that way, you will have the success. Therefore in that way, perhaps you can understand literally, yes, it is something that already exists and you are calling forth into your dimensional reality. And then how can I use them currently in my teaching situation? Well when you begin to connect with them on this shall we say more fatal or dense level, then you can get that information directly. That was why it was the answer to boldness. Oh, thank you. Sure. Well, that's it. Yes, you are. I do find myself wanting things more. My desire level is increasing. So is your deserved ability. Now not from the overall sense of all that is, but from your own sense. King of rationally, do proceed. Well, I think some of it is connected with this preferential preferential me that I have been utilizing in my creative imagination and dealing with situations. I have that feeling of the system too. Very much so. Oh, thank you. Very good tool. I have discovered I have had these dreams the past week where I seem to be encountering some part of my consciousness where there is reluctance or whatever to move into. Describe. Well, in one dream there is a large airplane coming in for a landing like a 747. And it comes in and there is a big black screen in front of it. And I can see that I know that there is a runway path to screen, but the plane is going to have to go through it. Happenating. Yeah. In another dream I have, I am being, I am watching a black cyclone, a tornado, and it is charcoal black. And it is hovering around and then I am running down an alley and I look back and it is the foot of the alley. I am seeing this black cyclone. So there is some thing, there is something in my consciousness which says express the sphere or are you running from the tornado? And this, yes, I did run from the tornado. Understand, the black symbol in this case will represent a space where all is possible, where all possibilities unfold and become a faithful. There is to some degree a reluctance in general initially when individuals begin to perhaps for the purposes of this sense is confront the vastness of their power. Understand, again, there is nothing that you can create within yourself that you cannot use in a positive way. And that simple piece of information can be enough to walk toward the black in the case of the airplane in a sense. It is a very strong reinforcement of what we have shared in the beginning of this interaction. Being that what is beyond the black screen will represent your intention and perhaps to some degree you may understand the screen itself to be the detail. It is unimportant that you focus upon them, simply continue to move through them. And again, there is the underlying knowledge that on the other side, so to speak, you get what you want. So look at your willingness to simply take that leap of faith in the airplane analogy and look at where you are running from the many vast possibilities within you in the tornado analogy, which generally implies a destructive force. But also understand that you can walk toward that. And that once again, it is not literally even a tornado. Anything in any of these dreams is you, including the black tornado. So when you sense you are running, understand that you are running from the portion of yourself that represents your unlimited nature, your again all possibilities being valid and accessible. If there is a little bit of anxiety about this, understand again that excitement and anxiety are the same energy. It is that when interpreted as anxiety, it is from a negative assignment or interpretation. If you understand you are assigning that negative meaning and simply choose to call up the preferential preferential use, you can assign the positive need and walk toward, run toward, rig toward it and jump, dive into it. You will not be swept away. You will be placed gently and firmly on your feet, grounding you, now possessing the ability to express all positive. Sound the kind? Very exciting. Will that be? Yes, thank you very much. Thank you. Hello. May I have over there? Hello. Hello. Hello. I'm while we are on dreams. Well, of course I would like to say that was a very beautiful lesson you gave us earlier. It was what I have been focusing on for the last two weeks. Thank you very much. Thank you for creating and the connection to our particular communication. Do you personally? Dreams. I have had a couple recently that are so bizarre that I do, I must ask. I had a dream that I was on a magical carpet with two or three others who were flying around a mosque and I suddenly received such an enormous jolt of spiritual energy that my body was rigid and shaking, my ears were ringing. I wasn't at all afraid but it was just an enormous surge of energy. At that moment I heard three or four voices, maybe more that I recognized as being spirit, both male and female, telling me things that were extremely important. They were very anxious that I know these things. The energy was so strong that when I came out of the dream I was unable to remember what it is that they were telling me only that it was something that they considered very important that I know. Well, in a sense, understand that you absorbed it fully but it will unfold as to the timing of where it was useful. Being awake in your bed in the morning was not the place. I thought you were going to say that. Oh, thank you. You are now acting like an evil. The second dream. One moment. But also there is again your willingness to soar as if by magic with other individuals of equal illness. And this will represent again your willingness to begin to embrace the spirituality through and within you. Understand that if you relax when you feel the infusion of what you have turned spiritual energy, it will flow through you like a fluid circuit and there will be no paralysis. There will be in that sense no sense of overwhelmingness. Understand next time that paradoxically your willingness to relax into it will then again allow you to regain the type of movement you are used to. It was not unpleasant at all but I was surprised by it. Hey, three number two. You're number two. Even stranger but I'll only mention one aspect of it. I was walking away from a brief discussion with someone who was a little agitated but I wished them well and sent them gold and light. I was walking away down the street and walking towards me was a boot about boot style with a head mounted to the way of gold. And a male head so the entire entire individual was about two feet tall or shorter. It made a comment that the person that I was just talking to was a little upset and we had a good little chuckle about it. And we just kept walking. It was a very unusual image of course being one boot with a head mounted. It didn't move in a, but it moved in a very graceful manner. Could you comment on that? It is simply again the combination of the willingness to connect spiritually so to speak and the head while yet again in a very blatant form remaining quite grounded. It is perhaps again a very unusual representation of that circuit and I'll become incomplete. It's a club and fellow. We'll understand that you are in it and perhaps we'll get your kicks in much the same. I won't hit my head as much. No but you will always get a head. Thank you so much. Thank you. I have a tennis friend that I spent about an hour and a half with yesterday. She was asking me. Did you play tennis? Yes. Yes. Yes. Did you win? Yes. Yes. How did she handle it? We were partners. How can they? Yes. How can they? Yes. How did they? How did they? How did they? How did they? How did they? How did they? How did they? How could they? Yes. In the winter I played devil. Winning and losing is a lot less important. Oh. How could you? Yes. She was asking me a lot of questions about you and the concepts that were running for the first time. Yes. That was a question. And while we were talking, which was for about an hour and a half, it came up that last Sunday I had worked hard on leads for two days, picking them up. And I developed very severe leg cramps, Sunday nights. And we came up in our conversation. We took place yesterday. And this morning at eight o'clock she called me up and she said she had had the exact same leg cramps, the same position of the cramps and had gone to the same experience. And reminded me that this had happened the same way a year ago that we had both had severe cramps at the same time. And I've always been drawn to this person. I only see her in the winter when I play indoor tennis. And she knows I admire her. And there must be a connection there. Well, first of all, if I may ask, did you rake the lead from your excitement to do it? I will take that as a mess. Therefore in resisting perhaps something else that you truly wish you have done, you have created resistance friction. Is that truly so unusual? No. Now I will assume she was not excited about the raking of the lead. Well, she wasn't raking the lead. What was she doing? What unexciting things were she doing? I don't know. She said she's been very busy. Oh. Do you understand the point? Yeah, I do. Except I'm really am kind of excited about raking the lead now. I didn't use the thing. But I am now because of the feeling of connection I have to the planet. Oh, oh. I feel much more positive. No, they're all up, thank goodness. But the same thing is good news. You're a body. I can't. I can't. You're right. And perhaps you raked yourself across the coast. Well, I worked very hard that day. How did that move? Which? Yeah. Hence your body gave you some indication of it. But I'm wondering why she had the same experience right away after we spoke of it? Well, there is a connection that is most obvious as you have shared. Again, though, more specifically relating is what was she doing. And when you ask her, it will be more obvious. For her, okay. For her to see why she had a little time. The connection I was wondering about why we had a little same time. Well, again, you are strongly connected. It's sympathetically vibrant in it. I'd like to ask about one dream I had. Well, this is my first water dream. And it wasn't really very nice. I dreamt about as a large cauldron with dolphins swimming around in the circle. And the cauldron was being heated to a boiling water. And the dolphins were turning black. And I was beside myself. I was crying hysterically. And I was so obsessed. You are simply tapping into, shall we say, some of the attitude, perhaps in symbolic form, of many of your human population toward the dolphins themselves. So perhaps you can now look at how you made the other systems in that sense. For others, though, there are many individuals who interact with dolphins and make that available for other people to do so. For the joy and understanding of the experience. There are also many who simply do it for the mind. Therefore, in a sense, you may say, a form of slavery. That's interesting. I'm still going to be meeting a woman who is very well known for her interaction with dolphins. Also, bring this up with her as well. Okay. There are things for that person to share in addition to what I am sharing. Great. Thank you very much. And... Ela? Erm... First, I want you to thank you for being patient with all of us. I think all of us should practice that. Well, I thank you for thanking me. However, it is my pleasure. It is simply who I am to understand that if I am attracting to interact with any particular individual, I am trusting that I am doing so for a positive reason that will not only be of benefit to them or you, but also to myself as well. As you each begin in the sense to embody that attitude, you will also find the increasing of what you call tolerance and the decreasing of exclusionary practices. And also understand that that frustration is not being in the moment. If you are in the moment and understanding that the moment always contains whatever you need, there is no frustration. Therefore, thank you for being one of the many gifts that boldly chooses to interact with me and allow me the pleasure of your interaction. Do you proceed? I was wondering if we could switch to something lighter using the term in the colloquial sense. I think sometimes the questions are too serious. Oh, oh. But do understand that everyone's question has a significance for them. And just as you feel that I appreciate all questions and have what you have called patience, also understand that it is no accident that you are present with exactly the people asking exactly the questions that they are. Therefore pay particular attention when someone asks a question that you really think was a ridiculous question. For you are willing to assume that label in general means that that answer will apply most strongly to you. And that applies to everyone. Well, I was only talking about being serious. I was wondering, in short, I am wondering what you do for fun, but I would like to ask a series of questions all relating to the same topic so you will understand what I am thinking about. It will be easier if I ask all the questions at the same time. Oh. Can you tell us what you all do for fun on your planet? I already know that it is not a separate activity for you. What you are all the time is it already maybe. But still, I am curious about what is living like for you. First of all, what are your physical surroundings like? Do you have mountains and rivers and trees and do you have beautiful skies and sunrises and sunsets? But moreover, are you touched by all this beauty, the way we are? Secondly, I can fully understand and have experienced myself the advantages of communicating without language as far as many thoughts are concerned. But what about literature, poetry, singing? Do you dance, play music? Do you express yourself through art forms? Do you have sports and games? Third, do you have parties? I mean, wild parties. In short, how do you have fun? Oh. Understand, we do very often simply play, as you are saying, for the sake of play. This may take many forms. Sometimes we will in a sense play catch, perhaps you will say, with the bowls of life that have been mentioned. And there will be many different activities, although they will, in general, never be of a competitive nature where one loses and one wins. In general, there is a goal that adds, perhaps you can say, a team or perhaps a set of teams can accomplish this goal in tandem. So everyone always in that sense, loosely speaking, perhaps you can say wins in that sense. Our day will be quite spontaneous. There will never again be an agenda, and there will always be the allowance for what simply comes up, what is simply spontaneously occurring. Therefore, we always follow, in assessing what is right in front of us, our excitement, which then leads us from one exciting experience to the next. It is again spontaneous. It is again unplanned. Our physical planet is very park-like, very green. There is to some degree what you would call mountainous areas, though not as much as your home. There are many, shall we say, field-like areas, many park-like forest-like areas. Our planet is approximately 77 or so percent covered with water, perhaps including lakes and what you would call streams, rivers, would be in the upper 80 percent. So therefore, swimming is one of the things that we also like. Participating in shall we say activities in the water is a particular joy of my own. We also, from time to time, will have vessels that will sail upon the waters utilizing the wind. Though our, shall we say, temperature is somewhat moderate, and our weather is never, shall we say, swinging, there is, shall we say, a breeze. Though you will find there is not what you would call tides, so to speak, due to the fact perhaps that we have no moves. In terms of, oh, one, parking, you may understand that everything that we do is in this spirit. There is an ever ongoing sense of celebration. In terms of strictly planning a party no, in terms of many individuals turning up at the same place at the same time, yes. However, there will be a far difference in what we will consider entertainment and humor. Oh, perhaps there's an analogy, not that we have lamps or lampshades. But upon my planet at a party, we're ones who place a lampshade upon their head. For all intents and purposes, they would become the one. So though there are many similarities, you may understand there are many differences as one. Will the two answers be questioned? Yes, but not yes. Thank you. Hello, hello, hello, hello. Hi, Lauren. Greetings. Well, first, I wanted to ask something that I've been thinking about for a long time. Do you interact with our children upstairs? And just with me in particular, she interacts with data. And because she mentions these shapes, that hasn't been really mentioned in Java. Some reason I just thought like a data connection process. Well, there may be overtones. The connection is more strongly to our own civilization. Understand being that our parents would consist of you and the data. There, by extension, is a connection. Though it is, perhaps you can say peripheral. We do interact very interestingly enough. This question has not been asked very often. Many of your children, yours included in dream reality. However, this will generally take the form of other children, human friends. For most often, when any of you interact with us in your nighttime dream, it will bring it back as a seemingly very familiar friend. But in general, because of that reality, you are interacting with us as complete equals. Because the forms of bringing it back as a memory will, in general, be to bring it back as a memory of having been with humanity. In general, that is your interpretation of equal. So therefore, it may not be obvious to them that they are interacting with anything that is that alien or foreign. It is far more familiar to them at this point. Interesting. Whitney talked about her visible friends. One particular, Shaina, that she talked about. I am wondering, did she actually see them? Are they actually being the reason for something that I remember having friends with child? Can you maybe get some information on it? In a sense, you may understand that it is both. In other words, there is a consciousness that will correspond to it. But it will always be up to the individual to interpret, this is a real consciousness, this is my imagination. Generally, at some point, you will reach a point where you say, well, it is just my imagination. Therefore, the effect, the result that you get will have it having been just your imagination. But if it would, in that sense, be over to continue to define it as a discrete consciousness, then there will be the unfoldment of it as a discrete consciousness. So ultimately, it will depend upon the label that is assigned to it. For again, the assignment of meaning determines subtly the actions which then determine the effect. So it is wide open right now. Does that make sense? Yes, it does. I was also wondering if they interact with spirit-sized. There is, shall we say, some involvement from that end of particular guide, but it may not be that they are aware of them on a conscious level. Okay. Is that all? Well, yeah, I was wondering more about your interaction with them in particular, and during sessions a lot of times, it's always struck me as amazing how they could be awake, you know, five minutes in for the session, and then as soon as you go into trance, they're out. Well, understand. And having no agenda with interacting with them in what you call your dream reality, we generally simply play. And increase the activity and concentration of doing so during these interactions for the obvious convenience. Yeah. That's great. Thank you. Thank you. Is there perhaps a question you may have had from last month? No. Oh. Do you trust in our timing for selecting me? Yes. With me. May I? Good evening. Greetings. And good evening to you, as well. This is the only truth. My question is, last week I had a dream about talking to you. And it was specifically you, that's what I saw, but I don't remember what we said and what was covered. I'd like to know what we were talking about if you would fill me in. Nope. Can you tell me anything about the other business I've had since then? What can you tell me? You will always notice your willingness to express what you do know that enables me to expand. Your hesitation in doing so simply does not provide me with information that you already have. Information will always come along the path of least resistance. And if you know something, there is no need for me to know. Well, all I remember about the other's visitations is that I knew that it happened because I got a particular type of collaboration, my dream, and figures. And as all I remember of that, all the correspondence that came along, I think it was a very strange feeling sent back on the neck. Right. And my stomach was then, it was just a flip-flops. Why? You are establishing a connection and no more, can I say? I know. Thank you. Not as you expected. Congratulations. It's just something to do with what I'm going to be doing in the future. Thank you. Can you tell me more? No. Thank you. Thank you. Talking about dreams, I had a dream a few months ago and I saw a spacecraft. I've never dreamt about E.C.s. or, oh yeah, once. But I've never seen a spacecraft that I knew. The craft. The craft. It was probably a silver color, but it looked like it was an animation, almost. Until we looked at it more closely and I was very concerned that Mars would see it. I was pointing out to this guy saying, look, it's here. The spacecraft here. How exciting. What does all this mean? But as we looked at it, things began. And I was saying, oh, maybe we're going to go up in this spacecraft. You know, this is this. Well, you know, here's the opportunity here. And at that moment, it just being changed and it became a huge sort of animated, making mouth of some kind of cartoon figure like that. That was very entertaining and very huge in the sky. And it occurred to me that we were probably on board the craft. And in order that we wouldn't be, or that I wouldn't be so afraid, we were in tears. We were entertained by this visual figure that was a cartoon. And that was basically it. Oh, well, you sound quite resolved about whether simply that you wish to share it or was there a question? I just wish to share it. And your interpretation will do and it's quite accurate. And I wonder if you had anything to comment on that or anything further to add? There is a high degree of likelihood within the next three to five of your years that you will indeed have a physical craft site. That is all we are receiving. All right. Well, will I be, uh, if you think I would be going to board the craft? Not yet the time. Okay. By the way, by you. Therefore, you can interpret perhaps that dream is getting your feet wet. I wanted this as also, might have had anything to do with my, uh, um, expression of my, my, uh, my craft. The child with these, I've had any connection with that at all. Well, to some degree for there may be the opportunity for you to photograph some of us. Okay. And to your, for your willingness to act in this regard. Come on. Hey. I'm going to give everybody a turn, but I have another question. Oh. This was about, uh, I'm interested on a soul level about abortion. What do you wish to know? Well, is it a soul agreement? Hey, everything is. Yes. I, I, I think so. I just want to see you back from you about, is it possible that one soul will continually come back in that shape? And, and that circumstance. Well, from times to time, sometimes as we have shared earlier, individuals are not always from the perspective of a consciousness as bold as you all are in terms of being willing to dive into the limitation of this reality. So again, to use what we have just said in terms of getting one feet away, sometimes soul individuals will choose to, shall we say, create part of a life and not carry it all the way through. For shall we say a sense of the experience. Some proportion in that sense of this phenomenon will occur from that idea. Also understand that although karma is self created, individuals do create, and if one feels that it will balance in a sense their energy from perhaps having perpetuated or perpetuated a particular idea upon other individuals, many times they will take that form many times over and over again, because in their estimation that is the only way to establish a balance. There are again many other ideas according to this, but as you have begun by faith, it is always that everything is a form of an agreement. And always will there be another opportunity for any individual soul who shall we think terminates their step into this reality in that way to once again incarnate. As everything else, it is not an ending, simply a transformation, an exploration, an experience that is available. And again, because your society is conducive in allowing this to occur in this way, certain souls will simply do so again because it is an experience, an exploration that is uniquely available in only certain places, this being one. This is a sensitive question on our planet, does the fetus suffer any pain? Does that soul have feelings? It will depend entirely on the specifics. In general, no, but there are exceptions. Because they are not really a minor sin, not really a person until they are born in their eyes open. Our understanding of what you would call your conscious self would enter your body, so to speak. Now again, this is colloquial. The body and the consciousness are one thing, but in the focused way that you call entering the body will generally occur just after physical birth. But there is, shall we say, body consciousness extensions that exist prior. So again, it will depend completely on the exploration and the individual. This is an overall shall I say, a category perhaps you can say. Certain individuals will choose to, shall we say, realize more of a full consciousness. What was the timeframe for what you call the abortion? The one I'm talking in reference to is recently. We sense what you might call a peripheral connection, but she has in our estimation approximately three of your years ago reincarnated in that one. That is our strongest perception right now. You told me that the first time I ever had an encounter with you, and I had figured you asked me if I had a child three years old and I said no, but it occurred to me that my friend Lydia has a child three. So I figured it was her. Well, at this point we will refrain. But much has been shared. It doesn't matter if it's anywhere that's better. Well, we thank you for your willingness to begin to look at the connection. I don't complicate it. If you say so. That is one of the expressions of reality complexity, but the understanding of it, the usage of it can be quite simple. I trust in timing a lot. All is according to agree. Nothing has been breached in that one. We thank you. Hey, it's not to be. Is there this reincarnated in SSI bodies or who they create our official bodies to inhabit? Or are they still producing their own unique type of physical expression naturally? Very interesting. Fascinating. Why do you like that? It's a question that came up to me today and seems to have particular significance. All right. Fascinating. Very percentage. You may understand that similarly to your own society, while they are in tact as a society, they reincarnate so to speak back into their own society. But you may understand that one of the primary reasons from their perspective for the creation of my race and others which we will not discover is to, in a sense, reincarnate into our society. Very percentage. In order to ensure the survival. Thank you. I see. Do they at any time create artificial bodies that they use? Perhaps you can say altered natural bodies, which in a sense then become somewhat artical. Because aren't there several types, the taller types and the shorter types? I think, but in general, what you would perceive again is simply differing races developing in the same planetary system, not unlike your own, though again the races will differ. But also there is genetic alteration and what you might call surgical alteration to certain of the types. Now, are these types produced naturally or, you know, through like, sometimes a sexual intercourse change? No. Are they all No longer. That was the case. They're all tested in science. Well, in a sense. They do not have tests or tools, but we understand. We understand the attenuation of the genetic potency. Well, in a sense, it results ultimately in what you refer to upon your planet as replicative saving. And how does this fit in with my interest in the interdimensional travel and my patient in the way? I do not. How does? I think it has to do with developing the access for further exploration into these matters and coming into a clear understanding of the varied ways in which the all it does express himself and how it all interrelates into a grand whole. Well, that will do more. Thank you. Thank you. There will be about a few moments relating to this interaction. Hello. Hi. Related to Tony's question, there was a female data that you had mentioned. I don't know if it was last session at the house who acted as a liaison or something for. I just remembered in his question and I wondered what time crying she was from. I've given related his questions that they stated would not have bodies if they're only she more of an everary timeframe of your own. Okay. Is that all? That's it? Thank you. Thank you. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Thank you. I was wondering if there was anything that you would like to point out to me for the year upcoming. Well, beginning on that day, you are born into your own unconditional love. So simply be willing to remove the conditions to yourself love as we have discussed. And use should you still choose to judge yourself that judgment to glean where you are still imposing the condition. Perhaps you can call this the year of unconditional self love in your case. I'm just writing. Oh, yes. That's exciting. Thank you. And. Hey, hey, a friend is asked to ask about these in biology behind numbers 471122 and 44. They seem to be popping up in a spiritual reference. Do you have any comments about this? Not really. Other than perhaps the number seven representing to me. The seven densities of consciousness in your octave of reality. The sense that I had was that they were referring to varying degrees of exactly which is a state of the octaves of density or dimension. Before being the current dimension that we are aware of the seventh being the transformation that is coming up that we, as you said, are one-fifth away through. The eleven being a transformation beyond that. Any comments? Will you, Justin? Perfect. Thank you. Is there anything else you wish to say in terms of the other two numbers since you're on the road? Well, I know nothing about them other than they've been referred to as the beyond beyond beyond beyond or other strange vague terms. I know those are the numbers that I have no guesstimates upon. You would. But we thank you in that sense for demonstrating that when you already know something, there is no need for me to add anything to it. Everything. Hang on. Hey. I have a question that the little embarrassed things mean to ask. Oh, well, I will not be allowed to speak with my friends. I'm embarking on things now that are very exciting to me, a new career in the planning and things like that for it. And I'm noticing at the same time an old behavior pattern of mine is cropping up. Well, in a sense that is impossible. For with the new information, you may say it is the old you, but it is truly the new you trying on old shoes. If you wish, describe. I do because I would like somehow to shift how I'm doing this. I'm working during the day and then in the evening is when I have time to work on these new projects. I would say that I would not be able to do anything. I, what we would call, just veg out. Maybe I would turn on the television when I come in the door and it would stay on until it's time for me to go to bed. And that whole process is really unconscious. Well, not really for you are sharing it with me. When in that sense you decide and understand it is always a decision, a choice to sit down and watch as you say television. From what is available is that the most exciting option or do you not really look at what all your options are? It seems like I'm in this motion, my finger is doing it or I'm doing it and I don't seem to be able to bring to my conscious awareness the idea that I'm choosing every moment. But when it occurs and you are sitting there and saying perhaps I should be doing something else, rather than saying I should be doing this, I should be doing that, say this is what I am doing, watching TV. What are my other options? Invoke them, call them up, put them down on the table before you, then choose with your excitement. If watching television is the most exciting option, keep your eyes open to what you are watching. But if you give yourself the benefit of all the choices, many times you will simply find that one is more exciting and simply you have not given yourself the benefit to think about it. Where the automatic behavior perhaps seems automatic is where you do not give yourself other options. So simply next time, do so. It can be that simple if you allow it to be that simple. Do you see that as applicable? Yes, I was very concerned by the automatic nature of this and it's what I would term in a way depression. Since I'm not really asking and I'm not really excited and just kind of sitting there. Well, perhaps one of the choices in that moment will be meditation, self-reflection, turning within. Put that on the table, put it out again next to everything else available and choose. That way, at least, if that truly is the reason, then you will get down to the business. Perhaps sometimes you will find the watching of the television to be the most exciting thing. But when you have looked at the choices and chosen from those choices, that choice, then you will enjoy the watching and not judge it. Does that make sense? Yes, it makes sense. Do you understand that where it appears automatic is when you would give the apparently of it being the only choice. Rather than reminding yourself, there are other choices. It's in the part about reminding myself that I'm concerned about myself because if that little part, which is so small, it's the lever for everything. That is really the part that seems like I'm in a fog. So maybe even being able to bring it up to my awareness isn't there because somehow I walk in the door in that way. And this could last for days when I do this and I'm in a fog. Well, again, perhaps as a method of centering in those moments, invoke your clear intention. Whatever that intention is, then again, lay down what is in the moment. So if you find yourself watching television again, say, are there other choices? Remind yourself of the other choices. Then choose from a list rather than from one choice. I think that would really help if I could stay to myself when you do stay to you. When I say to myself, yeah. Now, do you hope that you can do this or do you intend to do this? I intend to do this. Then you interrupt that pattern. I'll send you with. Thank you very much. But perhaps up until now, you have simply hopes. Yeah. I felt powerless by that pattern. And I've said it myself that I've observed myself doing it when I've seen that when I had done it in the past, I didn't accomplish things in the past that were actually important to me and that I could have accomplished. But that was the... Yeah. This is the now. Thank you very much. We thank you. I deeply appreciate it. Thank you. Yvonne. Would it be more appropriate for me to study network chiropractic or channel a technique of feeling myself or with a study of network lead to the other? Yes. Yes. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. At this time, allow me to once again send my intention for you all to experience unconditional self-love. Because I have this intention in my reality, in my multiverse, you will all unfold and bloom as the most beautiful of flowers. You may choose, if you wish, to mimic the vibration of the reality that I am suggesting by simply also having the same intention. Intention is vibratory alignment. Intention is the establishment of a frequency moving through your reality, having your reality move from you in a way whereby your excitement is what it is that you honor an act upon. Dialed in, forges into the physical reality that vibratory foundational intention. The details take care of themselves. The details are not something you need prepared. They will be the fruit of your intention. If you will simply understand of that perspective, then you will derive great service from them. Rather than concentrating on the details at the cost of the intention, allow the intention to bear the fruits of the details. You need not hope, which again set up a countervibration. You can substitute intention, which is purposeful by friction. It is up to you. I wish you all, as you are all quite active in this regard. It was fond and loving. Pleasure.
