 I'll write out say how are you all this evening of your time as you create time to exist? Begin this interaction this evening of your time with the end following entitled if you wish. The idea of being white body. As we have shared many times with members of your society. You are part and parcel. Gradesations, radiations, pieces if you will, and at the same time fully representative of what you label God, what you label all that is. That aspect that you think of as God as all that is, is composed of what you would label. The white light of infinite creation. It is in a very real sense. Excessy, pure ecstasy, for that is the component that is the ingredient necessary for creation. Excessy. Therefore, you are all versions of this light broken down in specific and individualized ways. You are very really in a sense a prism that does break down the white light of infinite aesthetic creation. And that prism is composed of three sides. Those being your beliefs, your belief systems, your emotion, energy, emotion, the activating factor of feature, and your thoughts. Thereby they comprise the three aspects of the prism that does break down the white light of creation into the individual that you do deem yourselves to be. Each person, each representation of this broken down light contains the whole. For the idea of creation is holographic. What we mean by the idea of holographic is that every point contains all points. Not just philosophically, not just figuratively speaking, but literally. Therefore, you are all creating your own reality. And you are doing so via, if you will, your beliefs, your emotions, and your thoughts. Therefore you are each in a sense the white light of creation itself. Though part of the exploration you have imparted upon, that being of separation, of individualization, you may in a sense use the analogy. Although you do contain the totality of all that is, that for the purposes of this exploration as you label it, you are in a very real sense a spark of infinite creation. We shall embark with you this evening of your time upon what you might label, though not in a effort full way, an exercise, one that will, in a sense, nurture the crystalline seed spark of infinite creation within you to allow you to feel an an experiential sense. That although your society has labeled that you have many bodies, many representative forms, the form you presently most strongly identify with being the physical body, you have also labeled many other portions of your being, various bodies, the astral body, the mental body and so forth, these ideas. They are all in a sense coming together within what you may label your light body. Your that body will be in a sense a true representation of your overall essence, your overall higher self, not meaning to make the separation between your physical self and your higher self, for they are one and the same. When you do in a sense speak about communicating with your higher self, that does presuppose a separation that you are separate from your higher self. When you speak of achieving your higher self, that also draws a separation where there is no separation other than the way you define it. Therefore, realize you are your higher self at all times and simply by this realization and recognition you may begin to experience harmonious alignment with that idea for in these explorations of physicality. You have broken yourself down into many parts, into many compartments. They are only as real as you define them to be and therefore act as if they are real. As we have said and do maintain, you are always 100% beings. Even if you choose to use 90% to make it seem as though you are only using 10, you are always 100% all the time. Therefore with this recognition in mind, we will nurture again what we have labeled the crystalline seed within you, the spark of infinite creation for a sense because you do draw separation because you are exploring that type of individuality. You may as of now view yourself as but a spark. However, this is not necessarily the case other than how you do define it to be. Therefore, close your eyes and we shall together embark upon a nurturing of this seed. Take deep three loving breaths. Allow them to be as you say cleansing breaths. Allow them to be nurturing breaths. Think of them in any way, shape or form that you will. What do we do for seeing and as you are relaxing into yourself, recognize and realize this idea when we do from time to time embark upon exercises, meditation and this type of format with your civilization. We always mention that your imagination will alter these processes. Do not think that that is an interruption. Do not think that in any way, shape or form you are taking what we are saying. It is the function of your imagination to individualize, to tell alive if you will, things specifically for you. Therefore, whatever you get is right for you. Unless you label that it is not, it has no other than head and power however. So in the spirit of keeping with harmoniously aligning with your higher self, realize that a faculty of your overall being is your imagination and that you may use it as a tool instead of just an escape. Your society has labeled that it is a fantasy generating element and that people escape into their imagination. That is very good. That is an exploration of imagination. However, it is much more highly specialized, much more finely honed than simply that idea and it can allow you to tailor anything you do here by and here is the key. Simply validating what you get from your imagination. Therefore, as you will alter, as you will perceive what we are sharing with you, it is absolutely perfect for you at that time. Now, in any way, shape and form that you are accustomed, allow yourself to relax, to feel as if you say you are floating and create for the purposes of comfort, for the purposes of harmonious feeling, your place of perfect peace, wherever that might be, whether it is a place or not. Simply allow yourself now to go there and you will very really be while you are there at a point of zero rest state. As you do feel yourself suspended so that the forces you have become accustomed to, gravity, are not imposing upon you so that you are floating so that you do not feel way down. Allow yourself to visualize within your kept cavity, within your heart area, in a midline fashion, the idea of a spark, the idea of a small in a sense star or a gateway within you by allowing yourself to relax into yourself as we have said. Begin to visualize this idea of this spark. As you are floating in the electromagnetic fluid of your planet, feeling as though you are weightless, begin to experience the idea of this spark per se as beginning very slowly, very lovingly and a very comfortable way growing so that it begins to encompass more of your physical body. Begin to allow it to expand to the point that it encompasses your entire torso cavity, as you say, and as it does slowly creep inside, slowly gain in momentum. It begins to touch up against the boundaries that you have labeled your physical being. Simply allow it to net them up very comfortably and cozily do what you label the insides of your skin till the light takes up your entire body. Your time being, stopping at the barrier that you do consider your skin, your outer color aim. Allow yourself to experience this light, being as this light. Realize and recognize you no longer contain glands, you no longer contain organs, but you now simply contain the expanded white light of creation within your being, within your physical body. As you do allow now slowly at whatever rate is comfortable for you, for this light to begin to penetrate your skin barrier and begin to radiate outwardly slowly, still in a sense maintaining the shape of your own body, but now expanding beyond those barriers, beyond that border. As the energy goes, radiate out and become thicker and fatter and more encompassing. Allow yourself to coalesce outward into what you label a sphere of light. Allow yourself to feel as the sphere of light, no longer confined in a sense to your physical body, although the sphere of light does contain the idea of your physical body. Allow yourself to revel and recognize, realize most strongly you are swimming, you are submerged in the ecstatic light of infinite creation that you are. Allow yourself to be not similar to the light, but as the light itself. As you settle into this idea, you now become aware that you are the entire universe, you contain it all, yet paradoxically, around you are other spheres. Allow yourself to perceive these other spheres. Allow yourself to expand outward to begin to encompass the idea of these other spheres, so that the sphere you now are begins to contain many spheres, those of what you label the individual around you. As you do realize and recognize in as you say no uncertain terms, you are aligning with the energy of all others present. There is a mass alignment occurring within this exercise, whether you do feel that you perceive it or not it is occurring, it is happening, it is felt by the universe, just as you would drop a rock in the middle of a pond and that ripple will eventually encompass the perimeter of the entire pond, so does the ripple of the light of your being begin to radiate out 360 degrees in all directions. Yes you allow yourself to grow, to build the momentum of what you label this light, recognize that the center of your planet also contains a sphere of light. Allow yourself while in a resting stage to appreciate the sphere of this light of your crystal and planet earth, your emerald planet earth to begin to grow within the planet, so the light is now radiating outward until it encompasses the entire planet and now rather than the light being within the planet, the planet is within the light. As you do allow yourself to now contain as paradoxical as this may seem the sphere of light of your planet. So now you are a very large sphere of light that contains many other spheres and now is merging and containing the sphere of the light of your planet. Now you are now aligning harmoniously with the vibration of your planet, for as you are finding within your society all planetary bodies as well as the central seed mass in any given solar system that you do label eight star has consciousness. People will allow yourself to align with the idea of the energy of your planet simply in this state for a moment be the eyes of infinite creation that you already are in a conscious way allow whatever thoughts or feelings that you have to come into your consciousness realizing that now that you are aligned with your planet aligned with the other individuals on your planet that you may feel you may perceive momentarily during the course of this event to feel as the planet as each other for validating any thought that you now get. Recognize that this all did begin within what we labeled your heart area. What we shall now do is use this gate that you have labeled a chakra which is very really a energy board. See an energy board attacks a gateway to infuse the sphere of light that you are with as much on conditional love as you can master feel it now building within that heart and area growing larger stronger. I will count as you say to three upon doing so a while that energy to build when we hit that number three. Reel release it in an explosive fashion into the sphere that you now are that encompasses all others and compasses your planet one two three three weeks. Allow yourself to feel the effects of so much love. Do not be concerned if it is your tendency to release in whatever manner that may come. Realize and recognize that this is not simply an exercise. You are literally injecting your planet injecting your consciousness injecting the consciousness of others in so far that they allow you to influence them with unconditional love. Simultaneously you have done so by injecting it through your own self for that is the only way to love another. It begins with yourself unconditionally loving yourself. People swim in this idea for as you say a moment. What you label upon your planet the Christ consciousness from our perspective is your math consciousness a mass consciousness that at the same time has its own recognitions its own view. Only you have now allowed yourself to activate through that lens through that prism most appropriately in this time of joyous occasion of your near to flush your planet with the love. Realize you shall see all around you from this moment forward the effects of this love. Simultaneously you will see all of your emotions which seem most unlikely within your world scenario will occur simply keep your eye out and you will perceive this idea things which seem miraculous will begin to appear. Recognize. People are not the exception to the rule they are the rule medicals are common place to simply your belief that they are not that makes it so within your reality. Allow yourself at whatever rate is comfortable for you to begin again to condense down your being to reduce the size of the light sphere that you are slowly allow it to reduce till again you feel your body within the middle of a sphere only slightly larger than your body. Allow in this state again recognize and acknowledge the alignment that has just taken place. Allow yourself to slowly at your own pace recede so that you now again perceive your boundaries your outer shell but at this point we shall not condense any further for you have nurtured the spark that you are and you have initiated and created your light body within future interactions and within other events that will synchronistically come into your life having nothing to do with these interactions you will find many uses for this idea. You have now in a sense graduated to the next level of being next simply by participating in this exercise you have recreated as you do in each and every moment anyway your being however you have done so according to the unconditional love and ecstasy of infinite creation allow yourself to react lamate to your surroundings coming back into what you label your room at your own pace your own timing. What do we begin the interaction that we label the sharing we wish to make one other point when you have a conception when you have an idea whether it is an idea about how you wish to be you are at that moment that idea at that moment you are that idea already. You have then recreated yourself in the moment you are experiencing it and that idea you may then go and recreate your old self again but you do not have to there is no process necessary to get anywhere other than what you label within your belief system a necessity for having a process once you conceive of an idea you are that idea if you then begin to realize that you already are that way not looking forward to being that way not wishing you were that way not creating a process so that you can get from here to them but simply recognizing you are that idea and then moving in action as though you already are that idea then you are and that is as simple as it is to change anything within your life there is no more inherent momentum behind any one idea than another over there what you assign it to be one of the ways to give greater momentum to an idea is and this may seem paradoxical but it works out that way to invalidate it by invalidating an idea you do not push it away rendering it powerless you focus more intently upon it and give it more power that is why these things can seem insurmountable by simply validating all whether or not you agree with it the effect is to equalize these energies the effect of having equalized energy is that you may equally choose either with no more effort to choose one than another therefore the mechanism of realizing that when you have an idea you are that idea and acting that way and not invalidating anything determining your preference determining where you stand on an idea defining yourself but not invalidating what you do not pre-file allowing it to be in a sense realizing it has validity for the individuals that are within that discovery that explanation therefore you never can get rid of anything anyway for you are the entire universe where are you going to get rid of it too the harder you push an idea away the furthest that it can go is to the boundaries of the totality of who you are and it will bounce back with as much velocity and force as you push it away by validating any idea any given concept you integrate it rather than trying to force it out you allow it to integrate here is an idea here is what I stand in comparison to that idea all right I don't agree with that don't have to manifest it expedientity but it is there it is valid and I shall go off in my own many direction that is all it takes to change anything within your reality therefore in exchange for your willingness to share with our civilization with our consciousness while allowing us the gift of your consciousness which we relish greatly I ask you now how may I be a sort of a to you sharing yes yes yes yes yes yes yes thank you very much the idea is that the physiological child was a bit fatigued that evening and at times our energy can be a bit shall we say not really meaning it in an overwhelming sense but a bit intense and we did in a sense recognize that he was fatigued but there is another idea involved in this which we shall discuss a bit later do you have another question yes I wonder if that could be more to change in that energy or to the fact that something that you can't get in the channel where she was at the time of the channel you feel the relationship to you I give very much no that had nothing to do with it nor did as we have said there is a question about the question asked for we will answer and interact with any question that we think or inistically draw to ourselves therefore there is never anything that can deplete our energy for shall we say we do not buy into the concept of depletion however you do to some degree he does and that was one of the two aspects that occurred on that evening and then again on one other occasion but all the information was delivered and in a sense if you listen back to that interaction on your audiotate it will be imperceptible that that has happened thank you very much share it in a sense his personality unlocks from what you consider to be your normal day to day personality to allow our energy through and it can be a bit in a sense we do not mean this quite literally but it is the closest we can come with your language this oriented and therefore his interpretation of that is a bit tired a bit fatigued but it has at the acclimate and integrate the energy improve and continues to do so for this evening we feel things are quite strong and in place does that answer the question thank you very much share it we are not sure exactly what you are picking up upon but the idea being that there is humor in creation there is the idea that you have labeled the zen frame of mind whereby when you are seeing the inner workings of your surroundings of your universe that you can see a certain type of structured ordered ecstatic humor within it does that help thank you very much if you have a particular aspect of that definition simply bring it to us and we will work with that idea with you thank you very much for your share it don't be shy I have a couple questions by proxy from press all right questions by proxy go away I have a good day I always the first time we as you say do not exist so much within the idea or create so much the idea that you label time there is the targeting of our planet the idea of night and day and so forth but it is not shall we say as much of a factor within our moving around in our reality when you are in any given moment doing what excites you you are not creating a necessity for what you label processes you are simply being here and doing when you create the necessity for processes you then create the necessity and in fact create time necessary to undergo these processes so in a sense the way you have structured your reality you are constantly creating a lot of time on our planet within our society we living the way that we do only doing what is most of what excites us the most in any given moment create less time you are not experience time in the same way as you our physical life span for various reasons however is what you would label in your linear timeline 300 of your years we live that long again because we do not create as much experiential time so it may seem to us that minutes to be colloquial now because we have talked about time when it is not as of a concern to us but it feels as though minutes have passed for us and in fact years have chronologically passed we only experience it and only age as it was minutes therefore we do in the purposes of becoming physical still then become non-physical and a reincarnate to a degree much less and less within our society now create a 300 year approximately life span with and at the end of which we do not degrade we do not become decrepit we simply transform immediately out of our reality and what you might consider though not exactly our physical life bodies in a sense decay very rapidly and in a sense disappear that is the effect of it you however can also create less time what you have noticed in your society time and time again that when you are doing something that you enjoy very much time flies by very fast no you are actually creating less time because you are in the moment and if you perceive that a half hour as path and on your clock two hours have passed you have only aged one half hour what we are saying is you do have the ability to live 300 years but it is only by living in that way you also have the fact and the other fact of your ingrained beliefs as you grow one of the strongest ingrained beliefs in your society is a fear of death therefore you have a whole different orientation to begin with this does not mean in any way shape or form that you cannot transform it by again simply and it is this simple doing what excites you the most within the idea of integrity in any given moment does that help? Thank you very much do you have another question? Oh right you want to know about what your family system or structure is? Thank you very much in a sense things are a bit looser upon our planet than yours we do not mean this in a ceremonial ritualized way but in a spiritual sense each and every member of our society is married to every other member when for the purposes of procreation individuals come together there is the idea of father physiological mother gestation period which in our society is seven months not nine and then being being born but it is not necessarily that we have a nuclear family unit when asked do we have monogamy upon our planet the answer is a bit multi-faceted it is not so much that one individual will meet another individual and decide to spend the rest of our life together for that again implies processes implies putting things out into the future just more that well I'll put it this way if at the end of a physiological lifetime when we do move on and die as you say we have been with only what individuals than it was monogamous but that is in a sense the only way such an idea would happen in our insight it is not a foresight it is not a quayan that is no ritual individual always find themselves synchronistically attracted to any individual who will serve them the most and if any individual comes into our scope our reality we know beyond the shadow of a doubt that they are the perfect individual therefore there is not the idea so much of family units per se although the children do recognize their physiological parents it is most appropriate to say that the children are the children of all that the adults are the parents of all everybody in a sense takes care of everybody one over note and away that relationships if you can call them such are conducted upon our planet that differs in a sense from any of your relationship we always allow any relationship to be there for what it is not not for what we expect it should be therefore any relationship from our perspective once began continues on forever for anything that is created always exists so we do not have in superiority per se of the idea we do not feel we have lost a relationship we do not feel we are in a relationship that is not good for us simply when a relationship has served its purpose and we have much conscious recognition of purposes because they are very apparent to us individuals synchronistically peacefully lovingly go on that way maybe to interact together in the future maybe not but there is no negative emotionality surrounding this idea so set out yeah and I also would be chairing the phrase that I used in defining that is like I have failed Mr. Blake what we are traditionally called separated and the way I language is that we recreate the nature of our lives. How are I? You have allowed that aspect of that relationship to serve the sparks and that is important we did not then invalidate its transformation. Remember the only the only constant in creation is change change is the only constant to resist change is to resist the universe functioning in its normal manner therefore very good anything can be viewed that way anything can be viewed as an opportunity and you have done so do you have another question? Thank you very much for your share. The charm. Good evening. And do you a good day? Several weeks ago in an in-depth discussion. One more. The reason I say good day is because upon my planet it is day. Several weeks ago you and I had an in-depth discussion and one of the main subjects had to do with the how tenuous or fragile my financial position was at that time. Today I am skating on even thinner ice. If you choose to be with that thing all the way we would suggest choosing those words a bit more careful for that implies a possibility of falling through the ice. But several weeks ago you sensed that in the near future at that point you saw maybe some prospects that would relieve or give some relief to my financial requirements. I would like to ask whether today you still sense such prospects in their future for me. Yes although what we are talking about now differs from the idea before. We sense then there was an opportunity that you choose for your own good reasons. Do not be rate yourself this is within perfect timing to pass by. However there are other opportunities that are presenting themselves or they are not. Yes I have created them myself I will say. You always do. Even when you create the apparently that someone else created it. It is your creation. Okay thank you. I asked another question. You do not have to ask if you can ask. I have the understanding that when we die in this life that our belief system and what we believe will happen to us when we do die definitely affects what we experience upon dying at least initially. My question is if we have someone we care for close to us who is approaching dying and who basically have no belief at all that there is life after death. What can we most effectively do to make it easier for them once they do. See you can inform that individual what you have just told me. Recognize if there is life after death you may say to this individual. There is life after death whether or not you think there is. Therefore I will present to you my perspective not that you have to take just so that you contain the possibility to call upon it should it serve you and then present the idea. Again very often an individual does not believe in a particular idea when pointed out that that idea if it exists exists anyway that it can't hurt in a sense to be brief in this regard. So simply again allow that individual to realize at the moment of death at the moment of personal transformation whatever you most strongly believe whatever your most primary belief system and what you would expect to occur will occur generally if it is something somewhat tumultuous it will not sustain itself very long or once you are in that state you no longer have a time lag between having a thought and then and occurrence there are no in between processes you are then a thought for in a world of thought for there is no intervening time between the thought and the manifestation and individual else who through their belief system create shall we say for an example the hell scenario very quickly transformed from that idea for they change in a sense their mind and then their surroundings immediately change in court of thought simply if one has the notion within them that of that knowledge then they give themselves a greater opportunity to exercise their overall control and a sense in allowing fashion not make forcing fashion of that scenario does that answer the question? I'm not sure I followed all that let me be more specific. Thank you thank you. Let's say a person dies and their belief is very strongly that there is absolutely nothing no hell no heaven nothing after death. Thank you very much. Can you give me an idea what happens to that? That person will experience what we will label a limbo state but in a period in a sense when you're getting colloquial speaking about timing within timelessness they will come to realize a very basic two words I am they will realize they still are and then when they begin to generate thoughts will create and manifest realities and changes within that spectrum within that dimension of experience of that of. Yes it does. Keep going. I guess I'm still asking myself if I have such a close person to me can I do them any good before they die so that that experience is either foreshortened or more pleasant or doesn't last long or something and help them along the way. Again you can never be responsible for someone simply responsible to them by being the best you you can be so simply impart your viewpoints without them having to believe them that validate their viewpoint and allow them exposure to who you are which is the most service any one being can be to another being. Very good thank you very much. Thank you very much. Sure. I want to thank you for interacting with me and helping to remember that. As to you we relish again these interactions for a while though in an individualized fashion appreciate your point of view and each and every point of view that we become aware of allows us to see just that many more ways that infinite creation expresses itself in the multi-box. About three weeks ago I woke up in the middle of the night when it was a very bright star in my life. Oh right. It twinkles in. Within the physicalized room. Yes. No comment. Do you have another question to replace the no comment question. If you do simply share we send second new I have all the questions. Share. For sure. Right now in the Middle East of our world there's potential war. I guess there is also potential peace. I was thinking of that in asking the question. I want to know if you can comment on the possibility of which direction this might take. We perceive the idea of world unity unconditional love. We sense the outpouring from individuals across the other planet of the desire for peace. This does set up a most conducive atmosphere for that peace. But one idea that may allow individuals in your society to in a sense accelerate their notions about peace is you don't get peace as many of you think from hating war. You get peace from loving peace. There will be an hour perception around your 1997 year age shake up in that area. But we do not necessarily perceive that the situation before you now necessarily need harmony in a war like scenario and very well may be a burden. But there are other energies. There are other polarities to be worked out in that hotbed of your planet that symbolizes many different thoughts many different energy infusion. Does that help? Yes. Again what each individual can do is not desirable. Act as though you are an individual. That is already in a peaceful world. Not trying to try to establish one and writing letters never hurts. The idea is you are your government right to them. All of them to know how you feel are prepared peace. Thank you very much. All right. This time we will pause for a break of approximately 15 to 20 of your old minutes.
