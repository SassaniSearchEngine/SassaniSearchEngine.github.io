 I'll write out say I did you greetings this evening of your time as you create time to exist. How are you all? Thank you very much. Oh wow, to begin this interaction this evening of your time with the statement that indeed you do. You do create your own reality. This has been, shall we say, a very main theme of our discussions with your society. We shall, for a moment, get into the idea of the mechanism by which you do so and illuminate ideas about how you in a very automatic way of life. In a very automatic sense, utilize your belief system to create your reality. Understand as we have said that in any creation what you call God, what we prefer to use the terminology. All that is, is the prime frequency, the prime vibration of creation. In a sense if you choose to look at it that way. Therefore, as we also have stated, the idea that enables what you're able to be individuality is variations in a sense from the prime frequency. Different frequencies, different rates of vibrational resonance. And this is what indeed you are as a physicalized being. In particular frequency of consciousness. As you do in a sense divide yourself, colloquially speaking down from the prime frequency. The idea again of how you create your reality is through your belief systems. Understand this idea also. Belief systems are also vibrational resonance, harmonic resonance in a sense. They are again another subdivision from the frequency that you are that defines your reality. The idea is this. You have what you may label, your primary belief. In a sense it is your statement of what you believe your reality is or what you believe reality to be. The primary belief is a particular frequency, a particular vibration. As such, as all vibration, as all frequency, it shall we say congregates, aggregate around itself, be a lease of similar frequency, slightly in and out of phase with the prime frequency. And in effect what you get is a nice neat little package of beliefs. The idea that allows your primary belief to stand out is this aggregate of similar beliefs that in a very real effect creates a background by which you may perceive the primary belief. For no belief exists within a voice. Therefore you create a background. One way to look at this idea would be to consider the primary belief or frequency to be the originating sound. And the background aggregate shall we say entourage of beliefs, the echo. In a sense the way you have created time and recognized time is your creation. You continually perpetuate creating time from your perspective. The primary belief occurs first and therefore since that is followed by the idea of the aggregate beliefs you may consider that they are an echo in a sense a background for the primary belief to stand out in relief. When very often you begin to recognize that you do create your own reality. One of the ways we have observed that your society does in a sense trip itself up is not making the connection between the idea that when you change the primary belief by definition the aggregate surrounding background set of beliefs also changes. Maybe a very subtle change but by definition they do change the whole entire picture does change. Individuals in your society when beginning to recognize that they may change their primary belief however look not to the idea of the primary belief but the background from which the primary belief stands out to see a change. And what does occur is the idea of redefining your primary belief but comparing it against the same old background of beliefs and in a sense what this does is cancel out the change. For you are using the echo to validate what you are experiencing rather than understanding that when you change the primary belief it all changes. Therefore what you do yet from this system that background this echo allows each belief system to be self-sustaining, self-perpetuating and contain a system of self-logic to make it seem that and this is your perception of the background beliefs that the way it is. That is only the way it is because you define it to be the way it is. There is no per se that the way it is. It is all again neutral occurrences. Everything that does occur is a neutral prop. You plug in according to your conception of your background according to your perception of your primary belief the meaning. The polarity you plug in positive meaning, negative meaning determines the effect you get out. If you do change your primary belief because you now understand that you may interpret and understand that although you may be aware equally of positive and negative you need only expedient positive. Do not compare or validate that positive change against the old negative background. That again cancels out the change you desire to make. Therefore again it is a matter of trust. A matter of recognizing you always have 100% trust even if it is in a reality you do not prefer. Therefore you are good at trusting and you may recognize that as we have said believing is seeing and not the other way around. Therefore if you maintain a belief system you will by convention create the background reality to validate that belief system to provide the evidence from each circumstance. Therefore nothing is truly evidence of any idea only the echo of your primary belief. Is this translating out of me into your language? Thank you very much. The idea of then again being when you have changed your primary belief you may now recognize that it has all changed. Not Adam for Adam one bit at a time the entire reality has changed. Therefore when you find yourself using external circumstance as evidence you may choose to use it as evidence in any way you wish. You may look out there and use what is out there as evidence that it is not working to up to you. Or you may understand that everything has changed and therefore if you are getting a meaning a definition which does not support the change it allows you an opportunity to review that piece of evidence. And recognize you are only cleaning from that externalized circumstance a meaning from your old background. Again to simplify this idea. When you create a background from your belief systems it in a sense is a filter through which you will only see things that are consistent with that belief system. When you change your belief system the filter changes. New things with the same seeming outer coincidence outer circumstance will take on new meaning for you will in a sense refuse to allow it to be evidence for that which you do not prefer. This is what will break what you call that cycle of negativity. When you do begin new trains of thought new belief systems from time to time and you do allow outer externalized neutral situation to be evidence that you are backsliding. This is the old me I have lost my progress understand that you have not you are now able to view it momentarily from that old belief system to decide if you would prefer to resume the old belief system. But you do not have to you do not have to accept it as evidence for you now understand that evidence is simply the echo of your belief. If you are viewing it as evidence that things are negative look again at your beliefs nail down the belief that is still having you view it in that older perspective you will find it. Mostly it is very obvious when you are changing your reality the only thing that you need to do is allow any of these quote setbacks to be opportunities to view what it is that you are still believing from the old outdated belief system. Therefore you take anything that happens as an opportunity to put it right in front of you to nail down the last vestiges of a belief system which allows you to create in your life things you do not prefer. When you do recognize that by virtue of the fact that infinite creation has been queued upon you the idea of existence that you deserve to exist that you deserve because you desire or excited by something to manifest that reality that becomes the new primary belief. And nothing that you observed can be evidence that it is not so only that there are still shall we say issues to look at in order to truly allow the entire background to shift. But that's all it is a slight shift in a primary belief will give a grand sweeping difference in your reality that's all it takes. Some of the primary beliefs in your society that as you say are ingrained within you from your idea of childhood are as follows one I do not deserve all that I can desire I must earn it. I am not inherently as I stand worthy of it I must prove myself to the universe to deserve it that is a belief. You can now see when operating with that primary belief how the background sets itself up to give you evidence that this is so. We feel it is most obvious and mostly everybody present can understand that evidence but you do not have to keep using that evidence to lock you into that viewpoint. Again if the creation had bequeced to you existence and that is all the pre and requited you need have to allow yourself to create a reality that you do prefer. And other primary belief that is again ingrained upon you mainly because of your perception of linear time before during and after it's the idea that everything must occur in a process. For instance if I am to change the idea of my primary belief I must engage in a lengthy process and that process does vary from individual to individual. The idea you label psychoanalysis I must first figure out everything that ever happened to me in order to reconcile it in my mind. Alright, there's a valid path many do use it but it takes as you say many years some individuals never actually get to the cause of the problem. Hello can we speaking. Understand that no less valid a belief system no less valid a primary belief is that it is that simple. Having the conception is the same as manifesting the reality. If you will simply change your belief to that which you do prefer and then act as though it is already so it is that simple and that in a sense is the adverse or opposites of I must have a process to validate the change. You can again do it that way and you have seen that it works but it is that simple. It is also a primary belief and again you will allow yourself to affect immediate changes in your life by even beginning to examine this perspective. Therefore again recognize it is all within you. You do not have to validate with the echo you can validate with a primary belief. I now believe this therefore anything I see that runs contrary to this idea is simply an opportunity to in a sense weed out the background and it is all quite automatic. You do not have to analyze each issue will come up in perfect timing allowing you when it is most conducive for you to in a sense settle or reconcile these ideas to look at it simply that you may now realize you can trust your time. It is all coming up when it comes up for the reason for again it is the most conducive time place and space in order to progress with these ideas. One other idea what you label fear is a belief system. That is accompanied by physiological changes the underlying principle being that you believe that something is most likely to occur which you do not prefer. Therefore you cannot get rid of anything you are the entire universe. Where are you going to get rid of it too it is all you when attempting to push away an idea the strength and force and magnitude that you push away with is the strength that it will bounce back with when it reaches the parameters skilokily speaking of your being of your universe therefore do not in a sense get rid of anything simply allow it to transform allow you yourself to integrate it when fear does come along as you say. It is again an opportunity to view what you must still believe in order to be thinking that something you do not prefer is most likely therefore an opportunity. We have recently shared one other idea a small perspective that will allow you in a sense to cut through much of this. That being when you do perceive that something is happening to you when for a moment you quote let down your guard and choose to forget for whatever reason that it is happening from you. Simply when you do feel why if this happening to me born with a load of names simply change the phraseology simply in any given situation that this does occur with any emotion whether you choose the label of positive or negative substitute the idea of how does this serve me exactly as it is that is this light change in perspective which will allow you to glean generally what is most obvious but at least gears your belief system gears your thinking for taking it back within you for you cannot change what you do not own and therefore any perspective that will give you back your ownership of your reality as you have already created it will allow you by virtue of that same ownership to transform it into anything you wish anything. Therefore although we have shared the idea with you that what you label karma is self-imposed the methodology by which your society has up till now in a sense perceived of karma is not the only way that an individual may experience balance. When you do buy into the concept of retribution style karma you do create that effect it is not unreal it is a real reality you believe it to be most likely you will get that effect. In a sense that is what is now a cutting on a mass scale upon your employment at this time the idea of certain retribution style karma is playing itself out and the idea of balancing of energy in a way that will allow you all by perceiving it to glean many things that will aid and assist you for creating a life that you do prefer. However you do not have to do it that way you do not have to have an eye for an eye mentality if you do something you feel is out of integrity you can balance that for balance will be restored balance will be maintained. There is only a slight perversion on how the balance must maintain that has become your idea of karma do something bad something bad will happen to you do something good something good will happen to you. Oh dear I have done something bad in my last life better watch out alright that is one way to view it however again. Balance does not have to occur getting experiencing a negative from having put one out another pathway of balance in this regard can be as follows you do something out of integrity. Our again for the purposes of this discussion definition of integrity is the recognition of integration realizing that you have as much power as you need to create the reality you prefer without having to impose yourself upon others without having to hurt yourself or hurt others in a sense. When you do recognize that you have an assess function out of integrity you are within integrity to be able to have that recognition you cannot recognize that you are out of integrity when you are within the framework of being out of integrity. Therefore that recognition the moment it occurs may just be for that moment but you are within integrity in order to view that you have been out of integrity. A way to balance this idea can simply be to have that recognition this side you do not prefer function and operate with the belief system that you wish to have integrity and then act that way that also is balanced. You may balance out in a sense colloquially speaking negative with positive if an individual murders another individual one way to work out balance is to be murdered. However another way to work out balance would be for instance to prevent another individual from murdering another individual. There are many ways to look at it and it does not have to be so directly negative for negative. Therefore in appreciation for your willingness at this most exciting time upon your planet to speak to us to allow us to share in the idea of your consciousness to allow our perspectives to enter your beliefs to allow yourself to even think for a moment that you can create your own reality and you can set up your own new primary beliefs. I ask you now how may I be of service to you? Shitti? Sure. Yes. I've come a long way to talk to you and I'm thrilled to be here. Thank you very much. Stand up as well. I spoke with you when you were with Daryl and Al Myra a few years ago and as a result of that interaction my life changed within a matter of weeks. Oh not me too. I started thinking about what excites me the most in the middle of a rather messy situation in my life. I had been inclined over the years listening to your tapes to look at things like careers, what excited me the most. I really couldn't find anything and then I realized it was this man that I had loved for years and years and years. My first love and it was back in high school and I realized this is what excites me the most just admit it. And within a few days he called me up and we hadn't seen each other in 16 years. About a week. Yes. It was amazing. Within about three weeks we were living together. My first husband in moved to Florida and things went smoothly and there we were. And I was doing what excites me the most. Madly in love I was as alive as I think any human being could be. I was full of joy and also. Well the strange thing about this is I walked into the situation that I had left this man for earlier and didn't realize it. And that was somehow or rather he couldn't accept my passion. He couldn't accept my love. Oh right. And it was I couldn't I didn't admit it. I didn't make it a reality. I didn't feel that I was. What I did was I kept being who I was and he kept turning his back on me and he kept. He just wouldn't allow me to be the female that I was. He had to have complete control over our intimate relationship. And basically he wasn't allowing it to me. And it took me a year and a half and two miscarriages. I got pregnant. We had a child which seemed miraculous to me then. And I pregnant too much pregnant again which seems miraculous to me now. Because what's happened to me is I have I feel like I've lost some of my life. There's a lot of grief. Oh right nothing is in the sense lost when we understand. Right right you know what I mean. I can't really be old and I am. Oh right. You can't if you wish. How about proceeding? Well when he won't allow it's allowing thing he won't allow it. He knows how to manipulate time. He knows how to manipulate our environment in such a way that I can't kind of squeeze myself in there. And be who I am. One moment may I ask you a question. Sure. Are you excited about these parameters within the relationship that you are in? Mike I don't know what you mean by parameters. In other words what you have just detail for us does that excite you? Well what excites me is. One moment. Does that excite you? I don't really understand the question. Me as you label this correct in season your relationship the way your relationship is without what you wish it to be. Is it exciting to you? No not at all. All right. There is your place in a sense to begin. Recognize that you are functioning. Doing what does not excite you. I'm compromised. Recognize another idea. Any relationship that any individual is in always continues. However many times the reason that individuals have agreed to attract each other play themselves out. Now we are not saying necessarily that this is the case. Simply that you must allow any relationship to be what it is again. How does this serve me as it is? The answer may come of being it no longer seems to serve me. It serves me by allowing me to see I no longer prefer to be in this relationship now one other idea. Recognize that your primary relationship is with yourself. When you establish that relationship and do not in a sense we are not necessarily saying this is the case. However understand the intent behind what I am saying. When you understand that you do not need another individual to make you complete you already are complete. You will attract such an individual to reflect back to you your sense of completeness. When you attract a relationship as many in your society have chosen to do to explore the idea out of a need to complete yourself with an external ideas you can only attract a reflection to yourself of that feeling of incompleteness. Do you understand? Yes. Does that help? Yeah. Can you tell me anything about our bond? We seem to have this incredible bond that seems extraordinary. Our perception is that you have spent in a sense many lifetimes as you create that idea together in various relationships not only the one you are now creating but recognize an additional idea. Any person that you do in a sense come in contact with in a given moment for that moment is your soulmate. Is a reflection to you within agreements with other individuals to in a sense be within your space and allow yourself to glean what you will. So with that said anybody that you come in contact with in the moment that you are in contact with them are your soulmate by the strict definition of that terminology. But understand that there are also agreements made between individuals to particularly in this transformational age reflect to each other over a prolonged period of life or lifetime. The completeness that you now choose to experience. Therefore we do proceed in your instance you have made such an agreement not necessarily with this individual but the idea being to allow the relationship to reflect back to you what it will as it is and grant yourself the validity of your own life. The validity the worthiness to recognize that if you do not prefer it it is time to operate within your excitement or you are feeling in a sense the effects of operating without it. Can you tell me about the being that is going to be coming into our family anything about how this being is going to contribute to our family. I have a child from another marriage who is having difficulty relating to him and a new 16 month old baby that is changing a lot of things. As far as the sex as you say we shall abstain it is your discovery and we would not wish to rob it from you. However the idea of this individual as you are labeling that individual when we can proceed that as with many of the children that are now in this transformational lifetime being born upon your planet will in a sense impose less. Of a forgetfulness of their connectedness with the infinite you will find many of your children who are coming into your world at this time to be what you will label your greatest teachers. Although you are all teachers and learns again you are now beginning to allow yourself in a conscious way having experience for deathfulness of the ecstasy from which you do in a sense emanate you are allowing yourself within a life span to remember who you are become a member again of that idea. But the being of which you speak will have shall we say let of that to experience they will remember more of who they are. Recognize one final idea what you perceive to be trouble that one child is having with another child very often the parent as you label yourself. Or filters for many of these ideas that may in a sense for lack of better terminology mediate the flow between them differently allowing them to be who they are and at the same time recognizing your role in a sense in perpetuating some of this idea. Does that help? I have one of the question that's way off from this one. Alright. Could you tell us about the crop circles in southern England what they are about? Briefly. The idea is they are in a sense many of them extraterrestrial in nature and they are a code a mathematical code to in a sense play the code game. All you need to do is collect photographs of these ideas paying attention to the chronology when they occur in proportion to one another. And see what you get. We'll be very interested. We assure you and will unfold within perfect time. Thank you. Thank you very much for answering my question. I was not able to see that. I was not able to see that. Somebody with nice enough dance all my questions were all anthropically except one more. Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry. There's a life after death question. Somebody asked what happened after you die and you talked about the person realizing that they existed the I.M. to the reincarnation stage. What's the process one goes through to decide or whatever to come back into the third dimension or whatever appropriate dimension? I really much you know, it will be a bit difficult to communicate this idea. But when you do as you say die physically translate. At that moment what you believe to be most likely is what you will experience for. You have created a time lag so to speak in this physical reality between the belief and the manifestation of the belief. This is your idea of linear time. But in that reality as well as your sleeping nights, sleeping dream reality thoughts are things. The sense you are a thought for in a world of thought for. Therefore by having the thought the reality is immediately created. That is why you as you say have a bit difficulty keeping focus as you define this focus to be in your dream. As you change your thought the whole scene changes. And in a sense when you first translate what you believe to be most likely is what you will experience. But the forgetfulness that you impose upon yourself to incarnate in this way and maintain a focus without all that outer chatter, colloquially speaking, begins to soften. You begin to in a sense merge with what you would label your high yourself although recognize you are always one with your high yourself. You are not actually merging but you remove the filter of the forgetfulness and then assimilate the exploration that you have in a sense undergone in the past life and make any quote future determination for you are existing at that point within timelessness as to what purposes you would still like to experience, still like to explore and make again the designation for your next destination colloquially speaking. Does that help? Yes very much. Thank you very very much. And to you. Shitting. Case. Nailed. Then you. Greetings again. And to you. Could you tell me is there another universe the same as this one but a mirror universe. Reverse polarized in some way. Yes. And if so is it as real as this one. Yes. And yes. Very good. It is an idea. That is very valid. And in a sense you are peering into that mirror image universe when looking into your mirror. Do you like additional information of a specific nature along these lines? It has some intuitive input. All right. Recognize also. You cannot imagine non-existence. Think about it. Go ahead. Try. The idea of being that anything that you can imagine exists somewhere. Because of the parameters you place upon a particular dimensional reality. There may be more or less likelihood of it manifesting within that reality. But anything you do imagine does exist. Therefore validate your imagines. Imogenes. Validate your intuition. Proceed. Then I would validate the concept that these two universes can interact times inappropriately creating problems. Not problems. In this word. Complications. In a sense. No. Although again you have perceived it and may create a side or parallel universe when that does it. But may I point out to you this idea. That universe is just as used to itself as you are. So if you want to spontaneously by locate to that universe you would perceive no change. You would still be within a structure that you are used to and not again perceive any change. Would not even notice that everything was colloquially speaking backwards. Because in that universe it is forward. Do you understand? Thank you very much. Do you have another question? Yes. Could you please comment on Ruth Montgomery's assertion that perfection is reached when we all are one with God. And that will be the end of the hereafter. Thank you very much. That is not exactly our perspective. For we believe that in any given moment you are perfect. A perfect representation. A perfect manifestation of what it is that you are exploring. Therefore we don't see any particular reality as more perfect than any other reality. Individuals upon your planet make a distinction in quality between physicality, materialness and spirituality. We do not. Physicality is simply an expression of spirituality and therefore qualitatively the same. The idea of merging is a perfect concept of merging. The idea of separation is a perfect manifestation of representation. Therefore none is more perfect from our perspective. But again we validate all viewpoints. Does that help? Thank you. More questions? All right. What is the essence of relationship with God? In a sense we do not draw the distinction of separation. We recognize we are all again manifestations of all that is. In barking shall I say upon a particular focus. All that is is way to do what we are now doing. And do not draw a distinction that we need to reconnect or re-establish a connectedness, but we never draw the initial separation. That is a concept upon your planet and many other societies. Does that help? Thank you very much. Yeah, I have a few questions. All right. First off is negative and positive energies of this planet Earth that we are now, seems to be in struggle. All right. Before you proceed may I again reiterate a relevant point. As you do expand, by definition expansion is more awareness. What you perceive to be negative energy is a choice of something to experience. What you perceive to be positive energy is another choice creating a polarity. One moment. You expand. You will become infinitely in a finite sense more aware of both. More aware of positive ideas and choices. More aware of negative ideas and choices if you only became more aware of the positive, you would not truly be expensive. So the idea is not that it is not out there as a choice. The idea is that you may choose which to experience, for example. Many individuals upon your planet are now choosing to experience physically the idea you labeled war. However, many other individuals have chosen to not physically experience it, but be aware of it. The individuals in this room, for example. So you are more aware of what you would label a negative energy, but not have not chosen to experience it. Again, the point is you become more aware of both, but you only need to experience what you choose to buy into. Now proceed. Okay. Continuing on that thought. Today I was involved in a peace vigil. All right. And the people that showed up that support what we are doing in the Middle East and believe that we have to fight in order to obtain peace. All right. And at least in my feelings, in my being, I feel as a contradiction in life. How long? And how long in peace from war? And they think you can't. And I'm experiencing what you're explaining as a negative and experiencing that, as all the positive experiences that we were trying to perceive. May I ask you a question? By them allowing you to examine their viewpoint, not choose it, but further defining yourself. Have they not an effect been of service to you? Yes. All right. That is what we need by evidence. Allow any individual who comes in contact with you to be of service in that way. Present to them your viewpoint in a loving way. However, you do not need to convince anything, anybody of anything you truly believe. Very often when you do, you are convincing yourself. You are providing to them the greatest reflection of who you are by exposing them to your viewpoint. And then as any gift, allowing them to either accept or reject it without an effect, taking it personally. Similarly, you may glean from them the same. You may look at what they have offered you as a gift that you simply choose not to receive. And then it has been of service to you. When they see you in a sense, going down, colloquially speaking to their level and arguing with them, you simply reinforce to them that idea when you allow them to be of service to you, reflect to you all, and allow them to accept or reject it, shall we say? You provide them an opportunity to see what that reality is like, where an individual does not have to impose their viewpoint upon another. You are a living example that such a thing is possible. Whereas when you scream back to them, you are a living example of what they are saying. Do you understand? Proceed. I have other questions about the Middle East. And do you feel that there will be ever a chance for us to resolve this conflict before just really out of hand? Do you think there will be peace? The idea is this. There is 100% chance there will be peace. There is 100% chance there will be war. Which do you prefer? By granting yourself your preference, I guarantee you 100% and how often do you get that guarantee? You will be on a world of peace. But many individuals upon your planet are displaying a contradiction. They are demanding peace in a violent way. What are they truly saying they believe needs to be done in order for peace to occur? Therefore, from your perspective, if you prefer peace, first of all, act like you prefer peace in all your interactions with any individual. Second of all, do not allow evidence to come from without to prove that peace is not in a sense on the way. Then you will be on the Earth that has peace. Recognize what we have shared about multi-dimensionality, about the idea of probable realities. They all exist. There is in a sense no marked future. There is every possibility. Which one do you pick if you allow yourself to function from automatism automatically? You may wind up on an Earth you do not prefer. If you will but own the idea, you will wind up on an Earth that will have peace. Does that help? I will question unrelated to that area. Does our government know things about other civilizations that they are not telling us? Yes, and have since. Your 7,7,47,1947 was when your government had irrefutable proof of our existence. How does it have to be any interaction between the government and other civilizations? Yes, they have. Do you have another question? It is an ongoing idea. Why are they withholding? The idea being that you are your government. Begin to act as your government. Begin to communicate with them as they are an extension of you. You have in a sense empowered them. Although the structure has been created out of fear. In a sense governments in the way you create them have been created to handle your fears. To protect you. Therefore that is what they believe they are doing. As well as the idea of when you function through fear you are generally fearful. Therefore fear that you have some power that can be interrupted. Many of your officials in the way you have structured your society and government fear in a sense that when this information does come out they will no longer have a job. They will sit with that. The definition of their job will change. You may communicate that to them in a loving way. There is a vast difference between the ideas you label protest and suggest. If you begin to suggest lovingly confidently instead of protest shall we say individuals upon your planet respond more favorably to this idea. All right. Did you have another question? When will the war possibly end in the Middle East and will the Arabs ever enlighten themselves to a point of existence on this planet where they don't fight against each other and most everybody else. Yes we proceed in the universe that we are coexisting with you in that you will have as you say in your 2001 world government and in the sense you may view if you wish you don't have to visit at a catalyst for enabling that to occur. However we do not necessarily feel that it is in your best interest to predict the timing but all the prediction is a sensing of energy in the now moment that has the most momentum. And therefore again what do you prefer what will you be a reflection of you can only experience the reality you are the vibration of what will be your vibration what will you attract to yourself. This is where it all begins within each individual through your belief systems that we have described earlier in this interaction. Go forth and act as though you prefer peace. You cannot get any other results but experiencing that peace for you will not allow anything to be an interruption in the peace of mind. Thank you very much. Yes. I am very happy to be speaking with you tonight. I love you. Thank you. I was introduced to you about two years ago and since then I have been trying to operate my life on what excites me also. Oh and you had a good time trying. Yes I think I have been experiencing lots of things that have come into my life and have opened more awareness for me. I have been reading a book lately by Wayne Drawer, Dr. Wayne Drawer and he discusses as you have tonight about your thoughts creating your universe what is happening in your life. Oh it's going around. And all my issues between scarcity and abundance and I'm trying and I'm operating more towards abundance and thinking even if I have five dollars in my pocket I'm abundant and looking around me and saying this is what I have this is wonderful and granting us that being this. My husband who is here with me tonight I feel tends to go towards scarcity and we often have a lot of conflicts. What is that allowing you to view? How is that being of service to you? Well it serves me in the thought that I don't believe that I'm not abundant. All right. Are you reflecting that reality in a non-enposing way back to your husband? No I think this is where we suggest it to start a place. May I ask you what is your definition of abundance? My definition of abundance is having things in my life that I enjoy and being able to know that whatever I need will be coming my way. What you need to have when you need to have it which all of you always do recognizing that this abundance always has existed and is not something to be achieved which puts it off into the future. And then functioning from that perspective, however, when you then begin to validate that your personal life, personal life, excitement is the truest reflection of who you are then those needs in a sense increase and the void is filled. Therefore the more you do what excites you in any given moment, the more shall we say needs you create and needs that are filled. Rosie? Well my feeling towards abundance helps move that issue out or that situation between my husband and myself then, I mean would that kind of like rub off? Again, by being able to reflection of who you are not in a sense scapegoating in other individuals for what you may label to be any shortcomings in other words things are allowing the evidence of what you go free for. That individual will see this function quite smoothly and then shall we say most likely wish to get on the back ladder. Another question that I really don't know how to pose it. I have an eight year old son and a four year old son. Congratulations. Thank you. And I feel that at times we are, you know, budding each other's heads. I'm standing here holding my ground and they're standing over there holding my ground and I try not to be controlling and to allow for them to be who they are. But there are times when I, you know, lose it. So why did I create these two, you know? Do not have to do it that way, but we have to do that. What is your specific question? I don't know. I guess. We meant to get that to be the point. I'm sorry. I guess I just need help and what can I, I guess I could say to myself what serves me to have this situation. That is my one. Step one. Then also from your end, what are you perpetuating from a feeling of powerlessness to control another and what are you actually setting down as guidelines that are well accepted within your society? In other words, many times these budding of heads as you say, most of those interactions are something, again we are the in general, which you could in a sense allow the child to do and discover for themselves. There is a propensity in your society and when it actually relates to physicalized danger, it's quite sensible within the parameters you have created, but that of, I wish to spare you from exterior which I deem to be bad, so you never have to go through what I went through. And very often this mentality went again not directly linked to physicalized danger shifting that mentality, allowing individuals to experience what they choose and in a sense live colloquially speaking, but consequences of particular actions is a stronger lesson than depriving them of that idea which generally then has an individual putting head to experience. You understand? What's that all? Thank you very much. At this time we will pause for a short break of 10 to 15 of your minutes and resume contact.
