 begin that question again please he won has life beings from various civilizations from many solar systems no one else so there are other individuals present I'm trying to stop laughing for me I know as a choice on choice on assignment may I in that sense ask you a question you sure may what is the source of your information what is the source of my information that there are many many many many beings incarnated on your planet from many other civilizations I believe that already from within myself I understand that though this is so perhaps you can say that in the overall scheme of your human population that there are not many many many that there are relatively few that function in this capacity they do exist but they are not perhaps as numerous as you are imagining from our perspective well I am also using creative ways to bring more light to all of the beings on this wonderful planet my question to the association world is if we all have an intergalactic family that we are a part of this might include a wife a husband kids which we have not seen since being on earth for this mission as long here is away from our loved ones how do they feel about this and when we reunite as one do we give our relationships on earth or at a higher dimensional reality would it be somewhat to us as anyway now first of all understand again that they are relatively few in number so therefore most individuals who find themselves attracted to the symbols are simply humans who have incarnated in human lives thousands of times and are now simply beginning to awaken to these ideas and attract the appropriate symbols so thereby those particular individuals would in that sense be generally reincarnating again to use that term with individuals over and over again and generally their quote unquote immediate family which is a rather arbitrary designation remains somewhat intact though there may be lifetimes where individuals go to and fro the individuals in that sense that are shall we say exploring assisting in the way that you are sharing or shall we say to that degree more connected to their respective society and there is an agreement and an understanding in their incarnational cycle that they will in a sense go to and fro this being perhaps fro or to whatever you prefer and will then in that sense reunite but not at the loss of human consciousness for once any relationship is established it continues forever now the definition may change the particular interactive parameters may change drastically but once established a relationship always continues so there will be the option to interact in the quote unquote future while you are still exploring a timeline then perhaps you can say after from the perspective of a timeline you are no longer exploring a timeline it will all be simultaneous and will not matter in particularly that way at all well let's say you have a female a female relationship on this planet and you have a female relationship somewhere else that you're just now finding out that you've had for a long time how does that those relationships at the moment of reuniting between the time when people actually is equal to each other how does that you don't have the voice out and uh... that's not a uh... on your planet you don't divorce anybody you just you go to another relationship and you you leave as friends we allow relationships to be what they are and do not have an assist insistence that they must be this or that so therefore when the face of a relationship changes it is quite obvious to everyone involved and we simply move on our way with no hard feelings also understand that we function strictly so to speak from only unconditional love so therefore there is no loss of love ever for there is never a set of conditions which one must fulfill in order to earn love which to us is a simple birth right so many of the things that you are discussing are shall we say societal implications from your planet who is exploring the version of love that you may call conditional but from the unconditional perspective everyone is an equal sharer okay thank you for now and i'll leave the rest of my questions for later on and we thank you as well female over there i wanted to uh... first thank you very much and to say greetings greetings to you as well we have had uh... my husband and i the opportunity to have been listening to your taste in california for the past year as our first time being here and we're just delighted and to some degree we have interacted with you in what you would call the sleeping dream reality though perhaps your perception or memory of it would simply be as friends human friends that you don't know in this life i guess it doesn't totally surprise me i would love to be able to remember more of that right well we would have preferred to surprise you but i'll run i wanted to share that following my excitement in many aspects and learning to accept abundance in many different fashions has really helped me to grow and connect more with my spirit guide although i i am continuing to learn but i think that by the way you always will continue to learn you will always will continue to grow and connect more of that but this not does not need to occur in a laborious fashion you know me very well uh... i would like to to lighten up a little bit in that growth but i have seen a tremendous amount of abundance and uh... i think once you start to follow your excitement and allow yourself to realize abundance comes in many ways it's a very helpful thing oh yes for the universe always reinforces and supports who you are the if you are being an obvious reflection of who you do not prefer you get the reflections of who you do not prefer if you are validating that you feel a passion or excitement about a particular thing because obviously that is most representative of who you are and you act that way the universe then supports that version of yourself which seems in that sense to come as great abundance but again we remind you that the definition of abundance is simply the ability to do what you need to do when you need to do it and money is simply one minute option of how that is when you have a tunnel vision that is the only way you exclude and do not see all the other ways that you create your abundance when you open up to the many other ways that you create that abundance you in that sense become more unconditional with your acceptance of abundance and the universe replies in kind by unconditionally supplying that abundance it's been quite a positive experience i'm very interested in the transformational age and i've been listening to many of your tapes when you talk about how within the next decade or so more overt interaction with other being societies may be possible i guess i have some uh... was wondering if you could be a little specific in terms of how will society begin to accept the transformational age once the notion that aliens extraterrestrials really do exist on a broader basis although i know we're gradually opening that awareness well do understand that to your perhaps you can say math consciousness aliens represent things that you have not believed existed within you so as you begin to awaken to the many other options of ways to create your own reality and many of the other ideas that exist within you you can will create an external reflection and you may understand that our presence our awareness our existence will be one of the reflections of that awareness so what i am saying is that we will only be able in that sense to be perceived physically by you once enough momentum exists within the math consciousness once enough individuals have began to open the doors and look at the things that they previously believed were impossible when that threshold becomes reached then the likelihood of our interacting increases for them we can provide the reflection of that expansion within your consciousness and we have most recently in that sense identified a particular date this particular month of your time as the date whereby that threshold will be crossed and that is your July 26th which by the way also has ancient my entire as well so therefore perhaps you can say in a sense if you are familiar with the terminology you are approaching shall we say in your mass consciousness the hundredth monkey phenomenon in beginning to open up your awareness and begin to shall we say transform your limitations into limitlessness I wondered if you could say a little bit more specifically any suggestions or ideas that I am not perhaps getting through some of the dream connections we have that might assist me or my family that I am just going to do this when you interpret it you will find most conducive that you will do so through your emotion through analyzing in that sense what you feel from an interaction that you perceive may have been with us analysis will not translate very well from that reality to this reality yet when you synchronize physically to us then that will occur as well but for now since tell empathy which is what we call telepathy for empathy is absolutely essential to occur it is emotionally transmitted so pay attention to how you feel look at what beliefs lie under or understand those feelings and you will begin to key into our particular perspective which will be assistive in an unobtrusive way generally it will present itself by simply in a moment where you would perhaps previously have created upset a little notion coming to your mind that shall we say allows you to transform it in that moment when you are willing to act on that notion you will be interacting with our reflection is that clear? very clear and I thank you so much for your time and energy oh and to you as well and now mayo I am interested again every medium I come to I feel is it for energy well how exciting wouldn't want you to be bored can you share with us baby? yeah what's going on here with us? you are growing you are changing in each and every moment you are a new person you create what you call the concept of continuity but simply you always create a new and every given now moment therefore you are perceiving because of the acceleration of the expansion of your consciousness a difference within you that you are then reflecting externally but it is within you allow us to provide an example you are as we have shared in a transformational age upon your planet you have explored limitation for tens of thousands of years and this is the gateway or the window through which in that sense you will now begin to explore transforming your limitations so accelerated is this particular point of time within your transformation which by the way is not about to begin but has already begun that you now in one day have the ability to learn, expand and connect with portions of yourself that would have formally taken individuals in your society two to three of your years this is one of the shall we say results of the transformational gate so therefore it is not that surprising that you would feel differences for your society in general defines itself by its differences rather than its similarities and it is an option to begin to define yourself by your similarities as will be one of the new perspectives within the transformation is that clear? there is a, oh why, is that a resistance? yes, yes, I am very excited about that I can't hear with the notion that earth and animal are the place we are you said about this animal reflection and then you said in mind animal if you will, reflection in your what? animal of what? it's continuing to say okay now we have discussed this to some degree and I've suggested that you can get the information directly is there something specific that you are seeking? not the seeking some others, some others are seeking any and the only way I can find out is by asking absolutely, okay, I would forward to that down on the bottom of the top of the slide in my house, where I am still being made and I've been making some of these four I think it's these figures that I've got in the internet are they just working? no, who you say hello? I did, I am here for that first and then I tried to communicate with my spirit but no, we have a trauma who can simply communicate so I wonder if you can share with me so I know there is an energy in the house a person who's got it and I believe that you can go and be still very simple, sit yourself down in what you perceive to be the center of the energy, close your eyes take three deep and loving breaths and allow the exchange, the inflow and the outflow with your environment, blanks your mind very clearly determined, establish how you choose to interact put forth in an invitation your particular desired parameters for the interaction, invite the consciousness to in that sense communicate with you directly and then and here as you say in your languages the clean shirt, trust what you get, the degree that you are willing to trust it and use it in any way that is applicable to your life will strengthen the connection, allow you to use that reflection and it is our perception will then transform that reflection okay my fear is that I was from the corner and looked right thinking something is going to be good, well that is up to you if again you act from fear put up a protection you set up the attack but you can always create, pun intended, a happy medium I believe that the feelings that not you or your society but your past others, and I do not you are touching on the energy of a direct individual that you have already defined begin there and then perhaps you will find other doors will open as well but allow the obvious to deliver its message interact with your reflection all right, there is no new effect unit out, the lady lives upstairs, knows the house she was the wife of the husband, she had not been ashamed very soon, but lived in, and then she was in a couple of words, and I'm wondering if you are sharing anything with her share with her, if you are sharing something like that people's suggestion, when you in that sense interact with a child simply look directly into the eyes of the child and see what happens yeah, I really felt that she had to picture out of the child but we mean physically yeah, I thought that I'll trust that, you need not ask me what you already know everything thank you see you next time I have four questions, two of them are from my mother who is a teacher all right, questions by proxy yeah, the first question is, could allow you to take in line with your little fit from the grid and you shed any life on that it is our particular perspective in this instance that she is in that sense experiencing physiological symptoms of what you would call the degeneration of her sight but the reason for this is that it is no longer necessary at this point in her particular, shall we say, exploration for now to concentrate so much on external issues it is again our perception that she will not necessarily lose her sight altogether however it will in some senses allow her to elaborately force herself to look within now her willingness to simply as you say, take the bull by the horns, so to speak and do so right now may prevent further of what you would call the degeneration is that clear? do you love me on things? would you take it with me by the horn in this case, me? beginning to look within now rather than needing to force herself physically to do so by taking away any other option question, why did she do a lot of physical pain? doing what areas of her physical body? she said all over her entire body, I know she's stuck that replay her back this is also related to the looking within and the collecting back together so to speak of what she perceives to be the many parts, the many reflections from her external point of view, so therefore perhaps you can share with her the beginning of this interaction, the idea of beginning to use the reflections as they come up realizing that when they come up is the perfect time to transform them and then she will not in a sense heal, shall we say the results of the explosive breaking apart of herself as what you may perhaps label psychic shrapnel riveting her body as her creations, look at how a creation serves her rather than what ways need is that clear? is there a phrase that can scare her and she can help her? hey, when something happens to her and again it is her particular perspective to say, uh oh, here that comes again, she can simply substitute what we have labeled the wild card for, you can pull this out and complete your hand so to speak any time and that is again the simple statement how does this serve me exactly the way it is? exactly the way it is that is using your creations consciously, it is most obvious in that sense what seems negative about it and the labeling of it as the negative occurrence has not allowed it to change, has not allowed it to transform and is therefore not the message, so looking at how it serves her in that sense will allow her to transform it I give that question to my fellow, do the old and share okay, I've been looking at for a number of years the inner mean, and I feel at some point I think growing child was high it is that inner child, that inner joy can you tell me be specific, is that what point did I 12 said or not let that come true anymore perhaps the point is not so much when did you but when will you free that child when will you understand that you are that child and you can now find it acceptable to express that particular shall we say fascination, that particular playfulness in whatever way it is natural for you to do so, allow that child to play through you for again you create your reality through yourself, then have a good time again in my second hand and by the way you need not judge the process, it is perhaps where you judge it that you in a sense seem to create a discontinuity next time in that sense if you find yourself judging yourself simply allow that judgment to be a reflection that serves you rather than judging yourself for judging yourself allow yourself to glean what must I believe to be judging myself allow that belief to become obvious acknowledge own that belief and then create consciously the new preferred belief to serve you and my second question is about my left eye how can I get I believe the muscle to the right eye what is the shall we say nature of the symptomatology you are sharing? I get called a symptom where the eye is not focused to see I get called it goes away called a lazy eye and I've been told it's not the wrong with the muscles to the decision that I made not to look at whatever it was what do you get out of not looking at it? what must you believe to feel that there is something that you would not like to face? oh there you go now again we have shared that there is absolutely nothing that you can learn about yourself that you cannot use in a positive way that is perhaps the belief now that you have acknowledged the belief that you have that you may wish to replace the old belief with once you have acknowledged it for the notion that something can creep in there and get you is the same as saying that you do not believe that you create your reality 100% all well and good for you cannot change even that belief until you will first own it so it goes back once again to using all these creations and looking at what you feel you need protection from and then perhaps if you will project in your mind worst case scenario using your imagination you will find that even that you can handle there is simply nothing that you can create that you cannot handle and your mere creation of it is your indication that you can handle it for there again are no pointless and extraneous creations that would simply not make sense so you have shall we say some home fun I would be told that I can't answer this life with that decision do you believe that? well I know that ever since I was a real little child I had trouble with the eye but again we suggest isolating it in this moment noting that you have connected it to a perceived past and proceeding from this moment utilizing and reflecting how it serves you in this moment with what's available right now not bringing in shall we say the past to confuse matters thank you very much and your willingness to begin to in that sense be willing to look at everything and perhaps request it fervently request to see these things will have the outer reflecting result of the compensation in the vision for that particular style of vision is again a reflection of what we have been discussing alright thank you we thank you as well female hey thank you thank you I'm going to go on working with you right now I'm working with you with the Chinese Chinese people oh can you speak up please? yeah right now I go quickly sorry to be children I'm not happy to be in your presence I'm just like a public image I'm thinking for it I'm just like a public image I'm just like a public image I'm just like a public image who are you? they are individuals and we are talking now for those who may not have heard about autistic individuals and retarded as you call them oh thank you that are choosing to explore different types of the focus of reality than yours many times at the exclusion of what you consider to be the maths agreed upon focus so their particular experience though it overlaps yours is uniquely their own and the joy in that sense that you feel you may understand comes because they have chosen this it is only outer other individuals who judge that they perhaps themselves would not like to experience this that assume that it is a miserable existence and it is not it is quite childlike it is quite fascinated but also again quite pointed to perhaps sometimes one particular focus at the seeming exclusion of all else when judged they are partitioned off from the rest of your society when understood they can in that sense be integrated into the society and treated on shall we say the level that they have chosen to express themselves as an equal and your willingness to treat them in that sense as an equal as you have is resulting in the positive joy feedback that you are perceiving that is so wonderful the other question I have is what is the attraction that I am having to multiply I am so strongly drawn well similar to your attraction for this interaction for that particular what you may call crystal and structure mold the vite is in that sense of extraterrestrial origin perhaps we can share as a point of interest that you have within your solar system between your planet of Mars and Jupiter what you label asteroid belt our particular understanding is that that was once a planet which was inhabited by the way with being similar to yourself that in a sense resulted in its own destruction and that that particular substance is pieces if you will of the planet itself which in your language translates to mal-deck so you may understand that perhaps the more appropriate label for that substance would be mal-de-cite are you still there? yes, I'm just kidding are you now exploring the expanded portions within your consciousness again as we have shared extraterrestrial sources things which are alien to your day to day shall we say perceptions are now beginning to be accepted into your awareness and this is a very blatant symbol of that willingness on your part to expand in that way why am I being led to that goal of so many people I just barely go off the hill again and you can go, please no, I'm just mad at it the idea is that again all relationships once established continue and simply the definition may change what you are beginning to express is similar to our own approach in our society is allowing the relationships to be what they are not what you insist that they should be and sometimes what becomes most obvious in a given situation is that it is the timing to so to speak go your own way but you will never exist in a vacuum and each space in that sense that you create will be filled, will attract individuals who are more reflective of what you are now choosing to explore perhaps you can say so that you have company thank you for being such a great question and you as well Fimeo hello, reading reading let's say, I am let's say, well we consciously met in November and I guess what I really feel compelled to do is just really validate a lot of what I have learned through my coming to your event and as the first one that I went to it was it was you are exactly be who you are you are true self and that has been so incredible for me just to be more credible but we understand it's credible but yes but and then I guess what I am saying is that I have learned good from pieces like do what excites you and with integrity and if something is going out in my life and I just really am not understanding it what I have done is seek to how is this serving me and all these things I really just wanted to say that it is really working in my life and it's really I guess I have gone through it some really difficult times in the last few months and just going back and just keep asking myself or God or the universe or whatever that has been serving me has absolutely carried me through and I think I have almost done the other side well may we make a suggestion to you sir stand in front of what you call on your planet your mirror and thank that for we are but a reflection as is everything else you see what creates the reality is your willingness to act or interact with the reflection we can never and it is not even our intention to do so prove what we are saying and we in that sense never insist that you believe what we are saying because it is us that is saying we cannot empirically for reasons of choice prove it to you physically right now however I can guarantee 100% that if you do what we are saying you will get that result and prove to yourself what we are saying so we thank you for your willingness to reflect back to us that what we are sharing is indeed quite applicable upon your planet it is absolutely and I have to say that I probably have about 10 mirrors in my one room one bedroom apartment so I'm doing that all the time thank them all do not leave one out they are simply the many points of view and they all serve you yes thank you and you as well and I just wanted to say that especially one of the messages well you have to have one that has been really terrific is that everything that happens is the exact right thing that happens if you use it yes and if we choose to make this I guess I guess I'm using my word but instead of it being like oh what a pain this is see it as more of a challenge and a fun thing and a home fun and good of home work it is always a joy to transform that which you formerly labeled negative for then with the same exact symbol you get the exact opposite result and there is a degree of ecstasy automatic once you realize this I think you are totally correct I know you are right in that but I just want to validate that for everyone here that it is true it is like true bliss well we thank you Mrs. Ambassador and thank you very much I haven't seen you on conscious level in months but we have been in touch I am sure we have and it is truly a pleasure to be in your company and display the season the pleasure is ours as well and we thank you at this timing we will pause for a short break of 10 to 15 minutes of your counting and resume contact at that timing how to go
