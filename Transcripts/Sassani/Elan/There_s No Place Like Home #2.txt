 Alright, I'll say continue showing. Hey, sweet mail. Greetings. Earlier. Now, you were talking about future to Kintira. Kim. And you would talk about her self feeling like she had come from at the society to Earth to visit here and then go back to the future. I didn't clearly understand why you made, I felt, a separation between now and the future. Well, you are winning and creating from what you call a timeline. So within the frame of reference of the timeline, the designations that we share apply. From the frame of reference of your higher self, perhaps you can say, which is simultaneous, infinite and eternal, then it becomes a bit more arbitrary. But you are physical beings in a physical world, and though we will discuss many times the simultaneity, the nature of your consciousness in that way, we will also, shall we say, play within the parameters that you have created. And so to make sense, linearly speaking, that would apply. Okay, so just the both. Okay. Thank you, Laura. Good question. I have done some happy integration and I've listened to the recollection three times the Oh, creating more time, yeah. Oh, one. And chose to integrate it three times. And again, I will integrate it this evening and ask for your sharing with me in listening to that because there's a part of it. And right now, because you expand on the point that I consciously understand is where time and space interact to create time or something. Well, the creation of the space itself in this particular type of reality, then again, by necessity, creates the time to traverse it, to go from one place to another place, so to speak. Now again, this is rather arbitrary in the overall scheme of things. But it was used as an analogy that as you create separation, as you create, for instance, space between yourself and the ideas that you express yourself to be, you then create more time in order to address each separate issue. But to boil it all down, if you simply, in any given moment from what's available, do what excites you the most with integrity and in the process of doing so, use all your creations rather than assume any of them to be extraneous. Then you literally are actively in the process of integration and in that process, create less time, particularly in the doing of the exciting thing, where you are at one with yourself at that point. Thank you, and that makes me excited to tell you, thank you about expressing the recollection tape that the person there was, the other person you said something like, yes, you have the judgment, he was talking about judgment about the woman that was talking, and he said, well, since you are her, so you directly related the connection and the integration of the oneness. I stand there for no time necessary to put it all together. Thank you, and that excites me, I like living now. Well, continue to be excited, and we thank you as well. Shut it up, you want. Good evening. And to you, greetings. Yes, indeed, I love every minute of it. And so do they. The question I have is, just popped into my mind, sort of like guys. Oh, popped, like a moment. I was in New Haven a few nights ago, and because of what I've been seeing on other TV stations, about a symbol of Jesus on a tree, and I found this to be interesting, and I thought there were two other people that were also interested in this, and we went down to look at this, but from, and one angle on this tree, you would not apparently notice that there was this, like Jesus Christ on the tree until... Well, innocence. But then when you got away from the tree, on the other side of this tree, I saw the arms of Christ. I saw the figure of Christ, and I saw the legs intertwining with each other. And it looked like a glowing... Now, there are lights in this park. It's in a park near the Italian section of New Haven, which you're probably not familiar with if you haven't been there. You're a child like their people. So basically, it's a highly Catholic area, and a lot of religious people around there, it's mixed. But when you stand away from it, you see very much so a clear image of the Christ, at least in the image that is comfortable to maybe the presentation of the people that are there looking at it at the tree. Can you explain how that process is occurring? From my going within, I believe that process has occurred through a projected image. So like if you take a projector and you project an image onto a screen, that's what you'll get. Well, all right, if you wish to use that analogy, understand that each and every individual doing the perceiving is individually the projector of what they perceive. Now does that make more sense? Yes, it does, because each individual obviously is getting a different picture than the next person. But there is a commonality in a sense, a common ground, so to speak, through which shall we say there is the conducive atmosphere for the, shall we say, rendering of the general mass agreement not to see such a thing, to be put aside. So it is in that sense a conducive mass agreed upon, or mini-mass agreed upon area, to allow individuals to behold such a projection from within. And again, we remind you that the second coming, so to speak, is the awakening of that Christ's spirit, of that unconditionally loving energy within each individual. So you may understand that perhaps war individuals to look most closely, the faith upon what they were projecting may in a sense resemble their own. Also on the tree, there were two children looking exactly at each other at the bottom portion of this tree. History has been there supposedly for generations, and these two children were looking at each other sort of like playfully on one side of the Christ. And then on the other side there was a rabbit, or an image of a rabbit. I didn't quite understand what that had to do with everything. Perhaps that was an interpretation. Right. By a particular child. Okay. And this also links up to something that is what I'm getting is going to happen in Southbury on all souls day on our planet. It's right after Halloween. And in a sense the date that is shall we say, remitly representative of the destruction at Atlantis. You're all hollows, being the evening before the destruction. You're November 1st being the evening of, and what you sometimes call all saints day, being the day after. And perhaps the true new year. So it's sort of an ending of an old and a beginning of a new. What's going to happen is that this cross on the Swarly's property in Southbury, we talked about it from time to time. On that day, it's supposed to be the miracle on her property. And this has been channeled to her through her channels through the interplanetary confederation. Oh, but you understand, as in the aforementioned example, all that behold such a symbol are their own projectiles. So they will behold perhaps something quite different from one another. And perhaps some individuals will perceive to project nothing. But some will actually project something when they go and look at that cross. That will depend upon them. But it is a positive. Very interesting. The other question I have is, I don't recall in terms of going on the ship tonight a lot of things. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. There was some images that came and went. But sort of like structural images, more anything else. Just right. Uh, structural images sort of looked like blocks. Like silver blocks. Oh. And I didn't quite understand what that was all about. It is similar to the, again, aforementioned idea of the storage space of liquid life. Stacked in a sense would be your perception. Okay. And why would I look at a stacked projection of liquid life? You're asking me. Why would I? I don't know. What will you do with the energy within them that you can mold to whatever it is you wish? I haven't really decided yet, I don't think. Well. I just, I do remember a, at one point, clearly before we were going back out of the ship, things became much more clearer to me. And I really didn't want to leave because I was starting to really phase in more of the images. Yes. But perhaps the misunderstanding lies in the fact that the clarity was necessary for the return. For the living of the life on the earth. That is where your focus is. I did see what seemed to be a couple of beings. I think there were three of them and they were wearing a black suit. I didn't quite understand that. Oh, what? Perhaps the motorcycle people. I just don't remember all of them. I was in a specific interaction with yourself in what we would call the association conference. Yes. That's something that I wanted to talk about because I felt like I was being given. I knew I was here but I was there and I was nodding my head a lot as if I was talking to a lot of people. And I physically hear what's nodding my head even though I was there sort of like I was taking information or understanding something. And I don't recall what the discussions were about. Yes. Okay. That is the idea. Allow the unfoldment. Allow the timing. Allow the flash of revelation of what has occurred seemingly in one moment but it will unroll or unfurl a bit at a time. And one final note I guess would be that the network itself, we have a station in New Hampshire which I happened to at this conference. I went to dealing with UFOs and stuff, a crop circle. Met another group of people at an actual TV station that wanted to be part of our network. And it was sort of like just saying hello, how are you and what are you all about. And that opened up a whole facilitation of the openness and discussion to the point now where they want to have a tape of one of our shows. And we're doing the show with the portrayals of the various people from your end of it that was on our second show. And they will be showing that on their show, on their TV station. Oh, you understand as we have always shared with you that you always attract the reality that you are the vibration of. And what allows that vibration to be seen, to be experienced by others is the action and willingness to put into motion what you are excited about. So as you have began to express physically your excitement now so do you attract until you all shall we say the reflections of life, vibration. This is only the beginning in that sense. And I understand to me my definition of abundance, we've talked about abundance a lot of times here, that I don't perceive abundance as just being how much money you have, but also abundance is in joy and in the love of what you do. And then your ability to do that thing in any way that you will create to allow yourself to do it. And I am enjoying every moment. So I thank you very much. And you as well. You're all right. Oh, you're all right. Greetings. Greetings. How's that imagination? It's pretty, it's working okay. Oh, that's what I wanted to ask you about. In the beginning of the exercise when you suggested that we dissolve ourselves into the shell and it's just material and that bubble. I could dissolve my whole body pretty easily, but I was having a really hard time dissolving my brain and I. That is because you have a very strong association of yourself and the brain and a very shall we say, pale, pale symbol. That perhaps you still on some level believe that your consciousness is the product of your brain. That's right. And I've been trying to release from my consciousness and getting down into my intuitive meddling work. Well, understand that you will experience either reality that you decide you wish to. So perhaps if you simply look at the idea that you wish to believe that your body is within your consciousness, that you can shift that perspective accordingly. The brain is perhaps you can say the physical symbol that allows so to speak for the mid-wiping of the intersection of your pure consciousness with physical reality in the form of body. But it is not the generator of the consciousness by any means. And is a result, a response of consciousness. I was also thinking that the focus on the eyes was my perhaps fear of letting go of just the material world that I can see. Well, to some degree also placing more credence in what you can see and what you can feel rather than assuming that all other realities are at its balance. Again, perhaps an elaborate symbolic extension of what you sometimes call seeing is the leading. But we remind you that the leading is seeing as well. When I was going into the shift, I was focusing on when you were saying have us coming together as fast as many different facets of one crystal. And I was trying to see myself. Oh, all this trying. You wasn't. I was making an effort to. Okay. I think myself. I can't believe the people in the group going on to the ship. And I initially felt a pull to go and be with children there. But I rejected that because I wanted to work on a specific thing here in this life. I am able to give and take unconditional love and joy well with children and animals. But with adults, I like myself. I feel reservation and fear and I don't feel able to be a child with them. So on the on the ship, I was able to see, I guess, the group here. And I kind of felt like a child among children. Nice. And we do not choose to quote unquote lose that portion of ourselves. Oh, grow up is not one of our things. It felt nice because I imagine myself folding everyone into me in a loving way. And I wanted to bring that back to me here in this world so that I could let go of a lot of the fears that I have around being able to. I think on the barriers that keep me from expressing the child like hard of me that wants to have fun with other people. And I found myself hesitating a little bit as I got back here stepping back into my old fear. Can you suggest a way to? Well, first of all, allow me to share a little secret, which is no secret at all. You have brought it back. Now it is simply a matter of pushing aside the trying and effortful idea of expressing it and simply trusting that the fact that it excites you is in and of itself the sign that that particular aspect of yourself is quite accessible. And your willingness to express it, not try to express it, but express it, will have a result. And that result will perhaps then perpetuate your willingness to continue to do so. So simply jump in. Sometimes I feel like I'm too happy with other people and I want to be lighter. All I can say that would be in the sense that the most empowering is go right ahead. Simply lighten up. Say, oh, I'm being heavy. Time to lighten up. Excuse me. If you press, read the press if you wish. That will lighten you right. Okay. But be willing to express it and trust that your expression of it is the perfect expression. And have some fun in the process. That's what I really wanted to hear again. Then you can and you shall and you have brought it back. It is within you and is of you, therefore cannot be lost. Thank you. You are for the reverb. You're posting. A few more. In my job search, I've taken almost two years to follow my excitement to my next job and it's led me through a number of different things. Now I'm looking at several different options. But the most attractive one would have me moving to Egypt, working for a factual corporation and working as a consultant to help them thrive inside their government owned industries. Have a look, Tripp? Well, I kind of wanted to get your feedback on that. You just did? Let's just sound right here. Did you say something? I'm developing the third entity, definitely. You're just exciting to me as well my options, but it's a little scary. Okay. It has not manifested yet as an offer or anything I can do to expedite that then. Sibley, do from what is available and allow it to be out. Okay. When I go there, well actually the first question to us, you've said that on your planet people do what they love and there's someone to do everything in their life. Well when everyone does what they love, everything gets done. Okay. How can we, I see that as kind of a goal for this world. How can we facilitate that? Get shaking on your own excitement as an example that such a thing is possible. When you then speak to people who say they are quote unquote excited about what formally you labeled Monday things, encourage them as well. For what is mundane to one is sublime to another. That is why all gets done. If individuals do not let society talk them out of their excitement, if their excitement is not something that is society. Okay. But I think my excitement is taking me into developing structures, reforming governments in a way, and I want to do it in a way that will facilitate one on one people following their excitement. So. And you do that. You are a beacon. As you do that, you are an example that can be beholden and seen by others. Only will the proof that such a thing is possible through the living of these ideas have a profound effect on a great number of people. Very often individuals will share a philosophy and in not living it, individuals perceiving or listening to the philosophy will say, well that sounds like, but look at you. Okay. Now the idea is, if it sounds like, and you are embodying it, then they see not only does it sound nice, but it is possible. Look. And that is the greatest service you can be. Okay. Now, I understand that. Thank you. Now in Egypt, what I will be working on, most of the have big answers there are owned by the government and very inefficient. When they try to privatize them to improve the efficiencies and race and standard of living, the fundamentalist faction there starts riots to kind of throw down the government. So how can I develop a, I mean, I can go in and say, well, at least be done efficient, how to make the industry more efficient, but how can I do it in a way that's sensitive to that fundamentalist group there? And so in other words, it's something that will work and not just be a nice plan on it. By empathizing and researching their point of view, rather than assuming that the only way to change would be to exclude their point of view. In the researching of their point of view, you can then incorporate a third alternative that allows that point of view and at the same time has the desire to end product. Okay. The way, maybe I'm wrong, but what I perceive their point of view is that they want to implement the old laws of the Korean in their government or restrict things that most people in Egypt don't want to go along with. Well, understand that the majority, in a sense, will design. But that does not mean in any way that you cannot be sensitive to at least what you feel are their concerns by becoming familiar to them. Or you may find again that very many, a majority of them can be addressed and at the same time allow for what you would perceive or perhaps label progress. Okay. In this country, it seems that a lot of our problems stand from a specially mandated focus on short-term profits at the expense of quality and concern for workers, concern for the environment, concern for society. To some degree, that is one contributing factor. How can we, what can be done to motivate or to change the structure to want this more balance? Well, again, not to be overly repetitive, but providing whatever relative, relevant, living example you can. Because when you do that, and individuals around you become interested in that, they will do it in their own way. They will do it in the many ways that is not or are not exciting to you. It begins a momentum, but it grows in what you call an exponential way, a pyramidal way. Okay. I understand. Okay. Thank you. How would a presidential candidate at the lectins do there? Clarify. Well, if a presidential candidate, what structural changes would they make to facilitate the kind of world where people are following their excitement and getting us away from our own? Well, that is a general question, and it is our perception at least at this time with less than place, that that is not necessarily even the intention. So, we are not quite sure what you are asking in terms of what is in place. That's not the intention of either the presidential candidates, but I was just curious, what can we do to facilitate making our world more like us? Well, again, as each individual is willing to express this through their own reality, which is the only reality they can respond from the responsible for, then it has a contagious effect. And should an individual grab onto this idea, who is, as you say, a politician, and becomes a living example of the doing of the excitement, that in and of itself will also be quite contagious. Okay. Thank you. The avatar, have you ever heard of the, are you familiar with the avatar course through a much more? We understand the right. The intellectual part of it sounds exactly like what you say, and I'm drawn to it. However, it's too expensive for me now, and the part I don't understand or have access to without taking it is the experiential exercise. However, synchronistically, I think you started out with two exercises very much like what would be contained in that course. Well, very much, and understand that once you create the bubble round and about you, and perceive that the center point in that bubble is what is represented by your body, and that that body is not who you are but contained within who you are, and you are opening the eyes of your consciousness at that center point. You can consciously decide and play around with the idea of closing your eyes at that central point, opening them elsewhere within the overall bubble of your consciousness, and then from the perspective of that center point, you will have seemed to be, quote unquote, out of body, but all you truly will have done is shift your perspective within your totality. And the understanding of this, shall we say, allows you greater access to that style of exploration than perhaps identifying with, and as a body that you need to get out of. You simply need to open your other eyes and close the eyes attached to your symbolic brain. Another question that I have, in past interactions with you, I felt sometimes like you were being critical of me, and I know that perhaps pointing some things out, but without any judgment. I didn't feel that way tonight, and I know I've offered to inject on to other people that they don't like me, and I was wondering, is that completely my projection if I felt that way in the past or would be? You're realizing us as an example, yes, for all we do is re-empower you and speak to you sometimes with the force that will awaken that idea within you, but never is it ever suggested that you are doing anything improper. Simply that what you are doing is not yielding the results that you say you desire, therefore, in pointing that out and then providing alternatives, there is an interchange. Your willingness to perceive criticism is your criticism of yourself from what I am saying, but never from my end do I ever in any way judge you to be listened very carefully, any less than myself in any way at home. Sometimes I felt that you were frustrated with your people, absolutely not. In fact, perhaps we frustrated, no way. And we are pleased with your willingness to look at these many ideas, for even when we did in that sense share an exercise with your imagination, the frustration was from your end. If you will recall. You mean just now when we were in the shift when we started. In a four-mentioned interaction whereby we had you recreate the preferential, preferential view, the frustration was from your end, but simply do it and there will be nothing to be frustrated about. Frustration is not doing what is in front of you in the moment and assuming you should be doing something else. I felt a little frustrated on the shift like I wasn't doing it right. I thought I felt you and some of my guys come to kind of restore me. Then you were doing it right and that you in fact could not do it wrong, but you could perceive and judge yourself. That will always be your honor. But rather than berating yourself for having judged yourself, use that creation. Ask yourself when you have some time to look at it. Why did I judge myself? Rather than judging myself or judging myself, let's just say, alright, alright, I judged myself. Now, in that situation, what must I have believed to have done so? Ah, I believe this and that belief will then enlighten you, so to speak, to a belief that you may wish to change. Okay. I felt like I wasn't at the level of joy that I wanted to have on the shift and I most thought that I was overly critical of myself. Oh. It is our perception that there were, as you say, moments of that joy as well. So it is not this or that, it is both. And I must suggest not having more of this joy. Follow your excitement and do what you can do that is exciting with your integrity. Okay. Not only is it the recognition of the excitement, but the doingness, the willingness to act without hesitation with conviction because you say so. Okay. And one last question. Of all the past takes of yours, for the yours, that I haven't listened to, which one do you think would be the most helpful to me? Trust yourself. Thank you. Also what you call unconditional yours will apply in the sense of self unconditional love and a fight. Thank you. Or do you have another last question? Well, I didn't have one more, but it wasn't so relevant to my process. It was more out of curiosity. Oh, no such thing as I don't care, reality, do you proceed? In your growth from fourth to fifth dimension, what are the issues that you're dealing with? Well, issues, not really. Joyous experience and exploration would involve, again, beginning to de-emphasize external tools and symbols and begin to directly experience us ourselves as the reality that we formally in a sense created to speak within. So does Steve. Therefore what you call sleep is more or less vestigial. What you call food is more or less vestigial. What you call the sexual act is now becoming more of an energetic exchange than a bodily exchange, though there still are some rounded ideas in terms of the bodily exchange. But there's still separate selves. At this time, for now. And is your sense? There is not the sense of separation from all that we interact with. There is an inherent understanding of each person as an extension of ourselves. Therefore what you call loneliness simply does not exist. And what your consciousness could describe as pure awareness? Perhaps this point in the way that you mean not exactly. There is still a degree of focus which is by necessity and expression in physical reality. We are beginning in that sense to de-focus and, again, de-emphasize physicality attempts. At this point it becomes slightly untranslatable for your one step removed from that process. But it is a, shall we say, form of expansion without losing what we are expanding from, but containing what we are expanding from. If that makes sense. And just one last thing, I often meditate and feel like I'm so happy to see you and getting directions from you. Is that actually happening? If there is absolutely no criticism. Okay. Never would we say you are screwing up? Never would we say you should do this? And never would we say why did you do that? Therefore when you hear those voices, they are your own. Okay, well, thank you very much for all the help. And you ask me? One moment. The engineer. Tation engineer. Oh, I feel so good about that. Uh, grieves. I have some quickies. Oh, all right. I deserve that. You deserve it all. It is a saunty. You have no language. You're telepathic. Okay. My question has to do with, in a sense, you're reading each other's minds. How do you achieve privacy? There is the allowance of such an idea if an individual would so choose, which we generally do not. In terms of what you might call loosely speaking a privacy energy field, so to speak. It is available, but rarely sampled. For there is a joy in the constant and consistent connectedness. Nothing to escape. Nothing to, shall we say, recollect unto ourselves. But from time to time, individuals do have that option. And you will also find, generally, in what you would call private session, where I or another member of my society would interact one on one or one on two or three with members of your society. A privacy field in that particular instance, unless in that sense it is requested that there is not. I was like Maxwell Smart's isolation changes. I think that we can see her when we are saying that. A couple of sessions ago you gave me some wonderful information about mother ships. And of course you have your skull craft. I think you mentioned also city ships. What are they all about? That is synonymous with mother craft. Though in some other societies the ships will appear as more city-like from your perspective and definition, but they are interchangeable terms. Another question. What is the difference between unconditional love to a spouse versus to everybody else? What is the difference between unconditional love is your willingness to love no matter what, no matter who, no matter when. You may understand that we, as you say, are constantly changing. Therefore we will always attract whatever individuals are, sharing similar explorations at that time. So perhaps you can say the bond will be the interest in what is being done. And as that transforms many times, so will a certain relationship in that way. It is more experiential than exclusion. As you are well aware in our culture we can be overly spontaneous and maybe get into some trouble. Anyway, when you do not factor in integrity with your excitement, when you factor in integrity and are willing to trust your decision from that point forward, never. The difficulty comes from again the lack of trust or the understanding that this excites me, but it certainly is not within my integrity. You and I have talked about what is constant in the universe and I want to ask are the number of over souls in any way a constant? In a sense, no. That is an infinite idea. Well, so therefore also, yes. Yes and no. It is not the full ritual just to be free or not. Because the over soul, the same throne, the same meaning as higher conscious. They are innocent interchanged. You may understand all that is to be the ultimate over soul. The final ultimate quickly. Is it insignificant today? Chances are what you would call 3 a.m. in the morning. Okay. Coming up. Yes they come. Yes they come. Thank you very much. There is a doorway that began 3 a.m. of this past morning. I see it. Thank you. Come on. Come on. Hey, sweetie. Hi, Lon. Greetings. I'm so grateful you wanted to share your thoughts with us. I am grateful that you all do us with your present as well. My life is going really well. I don't have any feeling of being governed by anything outside of myself anymore. Congratulations. Yeah, it's a really nice feeling. I don't feel if I have to live up to any lofty ideals or say thousands of people should be worthwhile. Now, in the determination of who you are and moving with that, you very well may have that effect. But you need not fixate a part. Well, I feel so content with what I'm doing. What's in my life and people are alone. I feel very happy. And I know learning and using your viewpoint has made a difference. Oh, now again they are not my view. Well, exclusively. You contain them and allow me to rattle them. Oops. I have a friend who I quite a can of with and have known for quite a while. She listens to what I have to say about your concepts and how I use them and how they affect my life. And she's very receptive. Have she noticed that you're a better loser? Yes, yes. Oh, you're a living You have to use the very custom. I have a friend who I quite a can of with and have known for quite a while. She listens to what I have to say about your concepts and how I use them and how they affect my life. And she's very receptive. Have she noticed that you're a better loser? Yes, yes. Oh, you're a living? Yes, I'm sure she may have. Hi, I'm a living. She's a very custom player. But she has a dog. Her name is Diane and her dog name is Will. She's a laboratory tree. Oh. And this dog is a nightmare for. He's almost a few years old and he's still very contrary. He causes her a lot of problems and she's really upset about it. She's tried all kinds of obedience schools and she's very loving to the dog. She does everything she can take off to help. And the last time I saw her, the dog had just done something and he'd run off and she was very upset. And I longed her the tape by the day of reticulum, her own on the animal kingdom. And I was just wondering if you had any thoughts? Again, very often when defining oneself in your particular reality, individuals will provide reflections of who they are. But as well, they will define themselves through the process of elimination, providing many examples of who they are not. Her willingness to make a determination and then a subsequent decision in terms of transforming the situation will be a best benefit to her. If it is not of preference for her to be in interaction in that particular circumstance, then she can, with her excitement, and her integrity make other arrangements. The only arrangement she can see is to have the dog for this place because of the number of other perceptions. The only other thing would be to give the dog to someone or she can't be presenting someone else with this problem. Well, if in that sense she is quite clear in the definitions of what it is she is offering, then it will enable any other individual she attracts to enter into the arrangement eye of her. But do not assume that what is one person's burden will not be perceived by another as a challenge. It is not the only option. And perhaps you can say, not necessarily the most integrated option. Yeah, right. Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you. Thank the dog, the symbol of service and allow her to derive that the service can literally be defining her preference and non preference. He's a beautiful dog, but he is a raffle. Oh, again, many will find this as a challenge. But only if you allow them to see her. Okay. Is that all? Thank you very much. Oh, my. Nice. When we initiated the series of interactions, at the point where we were reconstructing ourselves in the blue gelatinous material. And you have said, and you can be that body or that body can be yours, the body you're constructing in that material. Well, for at least that moment you are that body. Now you can continue by your definitions to be that body, or you can continue to devolve it into the old body. My question is, at that point, the next thing I recall is Maggie's sharing. So from that point to Maggie, we're sharing some time later, I resolved some flex. If you're filming in it all on where I was, what was going on? What kind of process was going on? Because I did not feel like I just fell asleep. Oh, because when I woke or became conscious again, it wasn't like waking up from sleep. It was like coming back. Follow a thread. What is the first thing beyond? In between the bubble and the sharing that you remember? Prior to, as you say, falling asleep this evening of your time, a firm, while you are relaxed and perhaps about to drift off, that you are now ready to remember what has occurred. Be firm, have conviction, have commitment, and then allow yourself to simply gently fall asleep. Pay particular attention to what occurs in your dream reality, and upon waking, write it down. If you wish, it is only a suggestion. Are you aware of where I went and what went on? It was just something great. But there is, in and of itself, in your willingness to bring it forth by yourself. A particular act that makes a statement that also then enables me to extend the policy. I see. Was it a process that involved direct society participation? Among other ideas. There was participation and direct interaction, which shall we say several different distinct and discrete civilizations, some of which have direct ties to your, in this lifetime, Catholic students. I had the feeling that I had been taken some place and that I had gone through a process to prepare me for some time. It wasn't just a physical process. It was a energetic process. It was a specific process. It was a energetic process. The energetic fields that I operate in have been altered to some extent. My ability to be sensitive to energy fields outside of the electromagnetic wave that I am used to has been facilitated. The options were provided, and you may now follow them should you choose. But one further suggestion that we will make is as an image, as a symbol after what we have just suggested. As you are falling asleep, invoke what you have called and referred to as the bird map. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. When I was sharing earlier about when I was on the ship and I saw children playing with walls of light. When I was thinking about what I was going to share about that, I almost didn't share that because I had that vision in total. Once before when I was in the expanded state, I saw children playing with walls of light talking back and forth. Well, your connection to us is not me. Did I experience that myself personally? Now you are exploring some ideas, and I will allow you to. Because when I came upon the ship and I saw the children playing with walls of light, it was very familiar to me. It wasn't like, oh look at what they do. It was almost like I understood the game. And you have played that game so to speak before, at least from the perspective of your higher self. I have another question. The woman that I shared that I touched right here was their specific message that she had for me. The symbol represents an opening of what you would label. Your intuitive self, but not at the expense of your analytical side. Both can work in tandem. Do you understand? You need not forsake one for the other. They are one expression, one idea. I would ask a question, that's a neat question, honey. In the fire's sort of initiation, the question is asking me, when am I going to get into China? And I spent, from my response, and this is a great deal this year. Why? I have sort of read many books and many people's experiences of anxiety here at the initial stages of China and confusion. But that was before the definition was rendered, that anxiety and excitement are identical, with simply different interpretations. And understand, though perhaps an interpretation will at first be automatic, it is your choice to continue to interpret it that way, or upon having discovered that you are interpreting it in an unprepared way, to change the interpretation. So play with that. One other idea that I've had for the one, I've never spoken with, I have to feel that when I play the balls of light, that the balls of light may now be my dogs. Is there any connection? Perhaps in the playfulness of the energy, but not directly. It is because there is a similarity in that playfulness, the possibility for that identification. Okay, it was the same feeling. Oh, what was my play with my dogs now? Oh, thank you. Thank you. Hey. Yes, you are. I have several questions, one is the deal with the entity Jesus. Oh. And a book I read said that he didn't die on the cross. That was a follower that was drugged and that went ahead. That is not our perception. Okay. Is that all? No. That just ruined that whole book. Now, now, did you enjoy reading it? Yes, that was a good one. That it ruined nothing. Oh, okay. That's, you know, it made the book not believable now. Because in the book he said that there was someone else. Oh, but you understand again that you need not unless you wish to have an all or nothing approach. Oh. Take what works. Take what means something to you and use it. That which does not fake it and push it on its way. Okay. But you need not because one thing is not relevant, it's taught out everything. You can, but you will then not be gleaming from every possible source. All the things you wish to attract. And the more you are willing to allow it to come in any form, then that will have it happen that much more. In a sense book, you mentioned that you said about the second coming. It said that once the second coming and the third coming would be Paul coming back to make, to fix the mistakes that he made. Oh, that is one way to look at it, but again, not our exact perspective. And I understand there have been many incarnations of the Christ consciousness. So, stating that that was the first so to speak is not entirely accurate. But that is perhaps the first in that particular individual form. Three entities that were in Christ, Christ, let's say three persons in the Christ's entity would be Paul, Jesus, and John the Baptist. Well, that is one way to look at it. Perhaps another way to look at it is that Jesus would in that sense represent the male aspect of that energy. And what you sometimes call Mary is also of the same energy, of the same essence, the female representation. Okay. And take a thought. You don't see. A question of personal question for myself. I think that I've been getting light handed. Oh. And I don't know whether to contribute to bad health or in transformation. Well, how exciting. What will you choose? Well, I'd like to think transformation, but I'm also going to the doctor Tuesday to check that out. So, covering Bolton. You have a perspective. Our perspective is that it is entirely up to you. Whatever you decide is the reality you will experience. But it is entirely up to you. One other suggestion in terms of a practical suggestion would be to work with or play with perhaps your breath and breathing. Deep breaths. Allowing the oxygenation of your system, the stealing of your mind, and the direct connection to the source of the answer to this question. Yes. Can I use that in my therapy? Did I? What you just gave me? If you wish. That would assist faith and help others to heal themselves. If they participate. Sorry. You can use anything you wish is up to you. Is that all? I have some good questions for that. You always do? Yes. John. Greetings. Two weeks ago, after a time-end. Now, do you speak up? We would not want to. No. I didn't want to do it. I went home. I did a flash with humans, but the stars and sunsets, and I was dead. I won't say it was a horrible dream because for those in the nightmare, I was very afraid. I still can't remember what it was, but the time was very vivid. It woke me up. As soon as I felt I was awake, it was a white light penetrating my 11th temple. I was sleeping, I was on my stomach, it was warm. I went, they're in a year. Oh, how original of it? I said, all you've got to do is open your eyes and turn around and see. It's that simple. I wrote all this down the next day, and I didn't bring it with me. I kept fighting back and forth. Turn around and look it up. No, I can't do that. Turn around and look, no, I can't do that. As I'm thinking, the light's certain to receive. The final thought was, you better look now or you're not going to see it. At that point in time, I opened my eyes, turned my head, and they're gone. Oh, no! Who was that? It can be representative as extra to restroom. And the dream in very much the same way was the representation of not wishing to face something within. In the instance of the dream, an actual chase did in that sense in suit. Yeah, there was another chase. But what was not understood, perhaps, at the time is that no one was chasing you. A portion of yourself that it would be who you do look at was presenting itself, and you were refusing to face it. Understand, on the one hand, you will always have that choice. And the quote-unquote waking experience was an example that it is up to you. But your willingness to turn around and face what you are running from is the only opportunity that you give yourself to use what you are running from in a positive way. We remind you, as we many times, do that you cannot find out anything about yourself at all that you cannot use in a positive way. And if you simply remember that, then you need not run from anything. But you have the choice, and that was another point. When I looked at it, it was like I'm getting closer. I'm more hungry than willing to look at it, and it's quicker. Oh! And you can inch ever closer, a bit at a time, or simply be there. It is up to you. But neither path is any less power. Oh, thank you. And there will be but a few more moments left to this intellectual. You are. We made it. And I. Um, Marcus, I was out on the dock and connecting to dolphin energy and other energies in a playful way. And I fell asleep, and the fog rolled in. It was a very beautiful night. And I want to have, ask for your insight on where the dolphins were at that moment. Were they physically? Hey, very close. And what was my resistance or theirs to having physical attraction? Yours. Yeah, okay. What? Okay. It's forward now. Yeah, why not? Back miltopeace. Look at that. Look at it within yourself for now. Which, thank you. Hey. I wanted to go back to Jesus, as I was listening to this discussion. Go why not? In perception of Jesus, it's Jesus, I mean. I mean, Sananda listening to these interactions right now with us. We are not quite familiar with the reference in the form of your channel. Die, rent. We have heard of it through you. Okay, well, Jesus, the form that I'm speaking of, is physical being an ascended master. In a sense. In a sense. We all are an ascented master at some point. And that he is actually a main commander. Not exactly. Understand once again, the quiet consciousness exists within all. It may have a different name in different societies, but every society has their version of it. Any individual expressing that through them is acting as that quiet energy and can perhaps use a version of a name to identify that idea. But it is more that an individual is simply expressing that aspect of himself rather than it being the literal singular being you call Jesus. Right. But I'm looking at the singular being we call Jesus. And I know that we all have the Christ energy, but that's not what I'm talking about. I know that we're a web of the Christ in a sense, but I'm talking about the Jesus Christ, the synanda or whatever name you want to do. What you refer to as Jesus Christ in the presentation as the human upon your planet. Right. Upon physical death did not reincarnate as you understand, but reabsorbed into the substance and fabric of your mass consciousness itself. Okay. And who is synanda? An individual expressing that aspect of themselves without any hesitation, without any doubt. But synanda has the same look on the same face of the Jesus Christ that we have been taught to understand in various parts of the world. Not necessarily. No. It may be interpreted that way by some, but not necessarily. So again, it is a discrete individual expressing that energy as a living example, in fact, that you can carry it. So this Jesus Christ or this is a man does, I call him, is he won't look exactly one. If we physically meet face to face, he will not look exactly as the Jesus Christ of over 2000 years ago did. To some men, but understand that that is arbitrary. There are no pictures. Right. Okay. That's a very interesting thing because I've seen some photos of the Jesus. But you proceed to be Jesus, the human being, was quite a bit darker in skin coloration than it generally depicted. Interesting. Well, I mean, that's the only thing I want to say is to Agitar, Athena. I send my love to them very much and I look forward to communicating them in the next month or so when they come this way. We thank you. At this time, it allow us to express in love, enjoy, and ecstasy our undying appreciation for your willingness to expand into yourself, to realize it is possible to begin to create your reality according to preference. You are the very home itself. There is no place like home because you are the home. Simply be who you are and you will express no matter where you are, your heart and that is where in a sense your home does lie. Therefore we thank you and bid you a most fond and loving life dream and dream lives and good evening. God bless you.
