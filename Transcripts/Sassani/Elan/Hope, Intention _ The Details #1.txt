 Re-aims this evening of your time. How are you all? Thank you very much. Although you do create your own reality and in this physical reality that you exist within for now, you do so through your actions, we have always shared with you that your beliefs and therefore your emotions and thoughts are a foundation for those actions. And that foundation has a subtle effect upon the actions and that subtle effect again through the actions creates the reality. Therefore, we wish to draw your attention to the fact that your words, what you say will often again be indicative of your true ability. Will often again, in and of themselves the words, be a direct indicator for, shall we say certain ideas that perhaps you no longer wish to carry around, but do indeed perpetuate and the willingness to express it in language is your indication that you still hold to some degree these beliefs. You may entitle this interaction if you wish. Hope, intention and the details. Understand the following. Very often the words that an individual will use is, well, I hope this will happen. Or if there is something they truly wish to manifest, they will say, well, I hope. I can only hope in that sense that this thing that I truly believe is most indicative of who I am will occur. Understand, as we have shared that hope in that application, in that usage, implies an underlying sense of doubt. Implies an underlying sense many times of despair. And in this, shall we say, condition of doubt and despair, it would take a ray of hope, a miraculous occurrence, in order in that sense to allow me to do the thing that I wish. Now, needless to say, this is not the approach of a conscious creator. Well, I hope, well, I think it would take a miracle for me to express who I am. Therefore, allow us to begin, rather than simply pointing this out, by providing an alternative to that wording, which then vibratorily sets up a new, shall we say, effect, a new cause, and therefore a different result. And that is, when you find yourself saying, I hope, or I can only hope, simply substitute the word hope with the word intent. I intend to do this, period. Therefore, in that sense, that still leaves you leeway. And still, shall we say, states to the universe that this is what is representative of who I am. I trust my timing. However, knowing that perhaps I cannot act upon it right now, I do not hope that this will occur. I know that it will, however I do not know when. Therefore, what allows you to, shall we say, crystallize it as a request to the universe itself is phrasing it in the form of intention. For understanding. Many things which excite you are not immediately available. You cannot do anything in that sense about certain things that excite you in a given moment. But that does not mean that that excitement is held from you unless in that moment that is the definition that you assign. What allows you to play through that moment and perhaps bring a moment closer, whereby there will be a choice that you can act upon to bring the most exciting thing is again. Affirming or stating to the universe that this is my intention. Now, again, if something is not available in a given moment, stating it as an intention sets up the vibration that all right. I acknowledge what is in the moment. I choose with my excitement and act with integrity upon it from what is in the moment. But I wish to remind you, oh universe, that I still intend to do this. Therefore, again, I will act like a creator in the moment, but one of the things that I still have the choice to do is again restate my request in the form of an intention. Not a hope. Understand. When you are in a given moment whereby the thing that excites you the most is not available. Paying attention to what is in front of you and acting upon those set of choices through your excitement with integrity is a statement that allows you to set up. Perhaps you can save the groundwork for the most exciting thing, allows you to set up what will present itself as the details leading from where you quote unquote are to quote unquote where you wish to be. Now, paradoxically, if in a given moment there is something which is not available to you and you establish a lengthy and complex form of the moment. A lengthy and complex set of details that you feel will be the only likely way to get to that intended idea from where you are. You are then fixating on the details. Many times again at the cost of the intention itself. Therefore, understand. When you have a clear intention, the details for how that clear intention plays out are awesome. Mastic. Do not require attention. They will be, shall we say, spontaneous in any given moment for things will introduce themselves that simply were not available. Perhaps you can say in a past moment. So in, shall we say, setting off the details, you are not even able to take into consideration many things which will develop. And again, fixating on a particular set of logical details will very often have you focused in a very fine way. And then very often you will not even notice the new circumstances that come up. That do actually allow you to accomplish what it is you wish to do far faster than the complicated detailed way that you figured was the only way possible. So what this all boils down to is loosening up on the details on how you will allow your creations to come about. And perhaps you can say tightening up on the intention on your unswerving willingness to maintain a clear intention. Therefore, again, by extension, in any given moment, there are always things that are available that you can act upon. If there are things that you wish to do that are not immediately actable upon, put that aside. But in the form of an intention, I still intend to do this, but for now I will reground myself to the moment in the form of again seeing what is right in front of me. Choose from the choices or options available in any given moment with that excitement, allowing that excitement to make it most obvious which choice is most representative of who you choose to be. Act upon what is available without any, shall we say, insistence on the outcome. Simply act because it excites you and allow the details of how the results play out to simply fall as they will. Very often individuals when acting upon something very exciting will rather than concentrating on the energy of the excitement as the motivation, concentrate on what they perceive the outcome will be. That, again, perhaps is not always the point of the excitement. Many times, perhaps most, it will be. Something will excite you, and when you act upon it, it will play out in perhaps an expected way. But should you find that you are acting upon something with your excitement, and that excitement begins to shift, you need not take that shift in the form of failure, accepting it as a failure. Simply you can understand that that shift is a part of whatever your intention is, and it may, again, not play out in a given moment from what is available according to expectation. Your willingness to maintain an expect and see that it will play out somehow to your advantage is loosening up on the details and maintaining the intention of the excitement itself. You need not despair if, again, something which has formally excited you, begins to lose the momentum of that excitement. For if you have acted upon that excitement, you have taken certain steps. In the taking of those steps, certain results were reached. You may be imagining that it must play out in a certain way, but it may simply be those very minute steps that you took gave you the information, and the excitement was, perhaps you can say, in this case, the carrot leading you there. Understand, when that excitement shifts, you can do one of two things. You can say, oh no, I've lost my sense of purpose and wander around aimlessly. Or you can say, all right, how fascinating, I never would have guessed it, not as I expected, congratulations. What is now right in front of me, and you will find different things to be in front of you than were when you were acting on the other exciting thing? Grounding yourself back into the moment and then asking from what is available right now, what does excite me, allows you to continue on the momentum toward the clear intention. Fixating that, oh, now what? When the excitement seems to shift, does not allow you to continue fluid movement. One exciting thing leads to the next, whether or not it seems in any way to be connected. The excitement, the vibration of the excitement itself is the connection, tells you it is relating, tells you in fact that the details to get you, as you create it from here to quote unquote there, is through this excitement. And that excitement is in fact ultimately what winds up being the details. Therefore, you can allow yourself in following your excitement to have the results of this excitement and the following of it lay down the very details that will lead you to your clear intention. When again you fixate on the details, well I must take care of every little detail in order to have my intention take place, you very often, if not always, do so at the cost of the excitement in the moment, at the cost of a reflection of who you truly are. So understand that automatically, and this has always been the case in anything that you have ever done anyway, will the details work themselves out. Now if in a given moment you have particular deadlines within the arrangements and agreements that you set up by all means, honor your deadline and utilize what is available in doing so and choose from that whichever one in that circumstance will be the most exciting thing. But you need not be responsible for how everything will play out and if you begin to trust in your moments to moments excitement, then the details will simply become part of the process, rather than the process itself, and will lead you in the shortest path of least resistance to the most exciting things. Whereby fixation on the particular details themselves at the cost of the intention will slow down the process, will add more events, more separation, thereby requiring more time to experience them. What I am suggesting is that by substituting hope with intention, by acting on what is available, maintaining that intention, everything else takes care of itself, and it is that if you allow it to be, it will always be up to you such complete perfect 100% creators are you all. Our approach in my particular society, never in that sense pays attention to the details, they are always an automatic, effervescently ever flowing set of events that simply automatically results from the having of the clear intention and the acting upon the excitement in the moment. So at least from my perspective, not that I am important in the overall scheme of your life and daily happening, but in our reality, there is a blatant example in our society that this does work. When you begin to follow your excitement in each moment, and perhaps down the line, see how things which were entirely unrelated to the most exciting things led directly to it, you will establish the trust that I am speaking on. For what other things that simply does not exist in our society is what you call doubt itself. Never do we have any form of trust that is not consciously placed. For again doubt is not a lack of trust, it is a complete trust in the very thing you say you don't prefer. And we always in that sense choose to express our complete trust in whatever is right in front of us and trusting in our ability to create perfectly by following the vibration that is most representative of who we as an individual are. This always results in the fulfillment of all your dreams and wishes. And as perhaps you can say a positive side effect, always is of ultimate service to the society that you are in, to all other individuals to the planet itself. For when you act with integrity that takes into consideration everything else being an extension of you and the respect that you will afford to these extensions will be mirrored back to you in your own reality. You will in a sense as you are willing to validate externally have that mirrored back to you one hundred fold in the form of what you would proceed to be self validation. We wish to thank you, thank you for your willingness in that sense to recognize that only flight simple minute shifts in your perspective and point of view. Results in grand changes in your entire reality those tiny little points of view are what has resulted in the life that you are living. Therefore what is positive in your life is the result of tiny shifts in point of view and what is perhaps perceived to you or by you as negative is also only a slight point of view. There is no shall we say mountain to move. Your life is the expression of the mountain of your consciousness and simply moves as you choose to move it and always have. Therefore the slight shift in perspective is all that is necessary and has again been what has already resulted in the reality that you now hold. So each time you find a perspective as simple as it may be that works for you and allows you to express your fullness your integrity your power. That can be all it takes as you say to transform your entire mind. I am not saying that from the assumption that all of you have lives which need great transformation. I recognize that much of what you have now created is satisfactory to you. However we are discussing going a step further we are discussing the fact that you can have it all. And when I say that no cure reaction for if your reaction to any degree is well yeah sure. You may understand that that allows you to see where you still draw the line with English because when I say all everything that you desire I mean literally but it is up to you and your willingness to accept that you can have it all and not need to have it all at the expense of anyone else at the expense of your integrity. That power is so great that you have as much power as you need to accomplish anything you wish in your life without harming yourself or anyone else and perhaps again conversely while being of service to yourself and everyone else. That is the degree of power that you have the degree of power that you have is so great that you can create the apareency that you don't even have that much power. Now I understand perhaps this sounds like a contradiction of terms but think about ponder how much power one would need to have to have so much of it that they could actually convince themselves they are helping. That is an expression of great power. Your willingness to experience yourself as discrete individuals with perhaps you can say a high degree of amnesia of the soul is an expression of great power to forget over 99% of everything that you know is an expression of great power. Once you recognize that you have done so purposely to explore the remaining 1% in peace to explore the remaining 1% without what you would create in this physical perspective to be the confusion of the other 99% is an expression of power greater by far than the splitting of your arsenal that is simply fractional in comparison to the power that you express on a moment to moment basis from day to day week to week month to month years to year in your life. And that is the expression of the power that indeed allows you to create the entire reality that you are within and only have the apareency of you being a player within it. Again, it may seem contradictory to say this is power, but it is. And we respect and revel in your bold willingness to explore the degree of separation and limitation that you as a society have chosen to do. For there are shall we say many consciousnesses out there which are not nearly so bold and which never do in that sense choose to participate in this style of creation. There is shall we say a respect from that realm for all of you. Ironically many times that is the realm many of you will respect, but you are far perhaps you can say more respected from that realm for your bold conviction. When we say that you are the masters of limitation. We do not say so to shall we say be ratio or chastise you simply to understand that masterhood itself takes many form. And the choice to master limitation and separation itself is a bold choice to express your power to the degree where you will choose from time to time to not feel your connection. And therefore create the senselessness of being alone is very brave. However you have done so just time have in that sense shown yourself that you can do even that. Therefore by maintaining your clear intention from this point forward on what it is you now wish to do you can begin to express your master of unlimited left. It is up to you. Whatever you decide all that is will love you unconditionally. Whatever you decide we will love you unconditionally as well. Perhaps by following our lead and choosing to match that unconditional love and apply it to yourself will also aside from maintaining your clear intention and allowing the details to fall into place. Aid and assist you in accelerating your time for your willingness to validate who you are then allows you to be that you most fully most effortlessly most directly removes the resistance toward expressing who you are simply because you choose to explore simply because you choose in expressing a style of amnesia of the soul to discover to learn things as if for the first time. That is something that you cherish most greatly even within your society for many times when you are perhaps watching your television or watching a movie as you say. You will enjoy them far more the first time not having an idea of what will occur. You even in that sense have a saying that there's nothing like the first time which you apply to many things. But the idea is that you could not have that experience at all if you already knew everything for you would always know what to expect. So understand that part and parcel of this physical reality itself is the experience of the unexpected but perhaps you may wish to look at experience the unexpected in joy. Because that is one of the points of this reality very often individuals will create upset from the unexpected which paradoxically create upset for one of the very reasons you've chosen to create this reality. Therefore in grounding yourself to this idea most firmly you may understand that in our society when one individual approaches another and asks how is it going and the answer is not as I expected. Our reply is congratulations and you too can congratulate yourself when something occurs that is entirely contrary to what you expected. For that is the details playing themselves out leading you toward your clear intention. If you label it as an interruption you slow down your own process. If you say well how unexpected congratulations what are the new circumstances. Oh new choices. Choose with my excitement. Oh joy. It can be that simple. When something unexpected comes up that is the point that is allowing you to experience that first time that you all say you love so much. Therefore embrace the unexpected revel in the unexpected swim dive into the unexpected rather than approaching the unexpected again as an interruption. Explore it willingly purposefully. All right this is unexpected. Congratulations perhaps at first you are simply humoring yourself by doing it. But if you set up the vibration of congratulating yourself you can then extend that to beginning to look at now that I have created this unexpected set of circumstances. What new advantages lie within you. If you look for the advantages from the unexpected occurrence you get something new to act on that was not present before by definition unexpected. Therefore you accelerate your timing toward your clear intention. If you decide to interpret the unexpected as an interruption you then act interrupted and get the result of having been interrupted then perhaps you then create the connection that well when something unexpected comes up. It always has a negative result but it is not the unexpected thing itself that has a negative result. It is your assignment of meaning your interpretation about the unexpected thing that yields the result. Do you understand the distinction? All right. Therefore I now intend to open up this interaction for equal share. I do not hope that you will participate for I am sure that you will. I am not concerned at the details of how this interaction will play out. In fact I am not concerned about anything. I am not concerned about the details of what I will say next. I am not concerned about the details of what the next interaction will be about. It simply is unimportant to this moment. What is important to this moment is that we are all here in choosing to co-create and will now in an open and equal manner, exchange, interact and share and co-create. For this gift that you bequeed unto me and my respective society I thank you. For it is a great gift that we do rather. And ask you now how we may all be of mutual service to each other. Shut it. Hey. Hi. Reaching. Excellent. Excellent talk. Thank you. Oh thank you. Had no idea what I was going to say. I never do. I have two questions. One is from my sister Nancy. Oh. And one for myself. I was wondering if you could contact a cognitive and I appreciate the term of a deer man who's nicknamed for me. But I would like a stronger, different nickname now. Oh, one more. Oh, the nickname was little one. And that in a sense had to do with perhaps you can say in recent incarnation the mere vast difference in your physical time. Therefore it was appreciated in that shall we say experience for what it is. But what I am receiving perhaps as a substitute. And again you will interpret this in any way you wish. Is firecracker. Still little but packs quite a punch. Thank you. And we thank you as well. Question number six. All right. This is from my sister Nancy. Her dog was just diagnosed as having a very fast spreading cancer. It was in his toe and was cut out and grown back again. She seems to have grown back again and she'll find out on Tuesday. The questions are she wants to know if you can tell her anything about that for one. If it has spread then the dog will die. It is our perception from our particular sense in this moment that perhaps you can say the time of transformation is not in that relationship. But again understand the functional word is transforming. Nothing is lost. Simply definitions are now different. I'm sorry. Is what? There is a likelihood that that particular animal will transform. But again have highlighted that the word is transformed. Still there. Changing shape. Proceed. Okay. She wants to know what three questions were for her. And if the animal is taking off anything from her. One more. In this instance it is not that apparent to us. Simply the sensing of the outcome. But again that is the symbol the dog of service itself. And understand that from what is perhaps about to transpire. One can lament and feel Greek which implies that something can be lost. Or can glean the service and ask how it is of service to be looking at this particular issue at the time. If there is perhaps direct interaction with her then perhaps we can interface with more of the reason. But right now that is not apparent to us. Thank you very much. And do feel free to release for that is a form of central and is a form of self-statement and definition. Always feel free in these interactions to the students. Thank you. Sharon. Hi. Hi. Greeting. Last time we spoke I talked to you about the limitation from the ancient one. The bulk of life. Thanks. The children. And I want to talk a little bit more about that. Oh. We do ask for the purposes of this interaction. That each of you for now do limits our interactions to one overall topic per shall we say exchange. Does not mean that you will not have the opportunity to ask other questions and have other interactions. Simply that it will move from persons who person in more of a fluid way to include more individuals. And you will very often if not always find that whatever questions you will have will be asked by someone else. Or we will come back to you again. Therefore do proceed with your first topic. Okay. I had another visitation by these being those silvery and almost translucent and they refer to themselves as dark coney. Oh. We are not familiar with that particular vibrational translation but do proceed. They knew you. Again. By that name. Okay. Okay. They said they work with my energy field with radionics. And they talked to me a lot about that. They told me that I am a sphere of light into practice being a color and resonating with it. I did meditate on a sphere of light in my hands with my eyes open. And to see what you had to do to see what would emerge from this. And something did emerge from this. What did you see? It was a circular violet light surrounded by a green light around it that moves around within the sphere of light. And when I saw that I disconnected from it and connected with it and kept reappearing. And I had a very familiar feeling about it. As though I had seen this when I was challenged. And so my question to you is can you tell me more about my going to the circle of light when I was a child? Not really for there are particular recognitions that will come as a flash of revelation. And will shall we say connect many of the dots that you are perceiving as random events. However we will say it was a style of direct participation with another stream of consciousness other than your general human stream of consciousness. Though there were human children in the circle. We will also say that the symbol of the sphere in the form that you have seen is indicative of what you would call your heart energy and your crown chakra energy itself. Therefore in a sense you may understand that to have been a reflection that these areas are strongly conducive aligned toward establishing certain connections. Therefore take attention shall we say to the energy sensations to the vibratory sensations in your chest area and at the crown of your head when you are further exploring the finding. You don't know who Dartak is? Do you know who that is? Again Ace but not necessarily by that name that is your interpretation and that will be. One of the questions what was the significance of the grass, the bird on my doorstep all day today and the cardinal at the window for quite some time. Oh, perhaps I will play however tell me what your perception is for I assume you have some conception at the time and wish in that sense to share in that with you first. When I saw the grass this morning on my doorstep and it wouldn't even move when my dogs were barking at it. I knew that I was going to do a great deal of releasing today. I went and had a, I didn't know what was going to happen but I knew something very significant would happen today and I went and went through a past last feeling that was enormously important to me. I believe the bird was almost a messenger for me. Well both were one in the sense of the freedom and the other in a sense of the shall we say unwillingness to move from your senses. That was the significance of the grass and the significance of the cardinal with the freedom. Because it is hard at the window the whole time past life healing was going on. And there is a perception from within you that in connecting with certain of these ideas you will liberate certain energies within what we have also again shared is that the area that you will find to be most beneficial to concentrate upon. Or again the heart and all right the head. All right thank you. In what you call altered meditative state what I have just shared will make far more sense. For you will experience you will feel what I am saying and need not analytically word it and nail it down. It may shall we say even be difficult to analyze it. It will be truly an emotional experience itself. The willingness to explore the emotional connection will open up many of the ideas that you are seeking. For it is a style of protection within you keeping you from exposing that at this point. And finally again I share with you that nothing that you have that you are or that you will ever create can overcome you. The fact that you created it in and of itself tells you that it is the timing and that you can handle it. Therefore open up your emotions look at them in the sense of not analyzing them but extrapolating the beliefs behind them. You will make many revelations. Are you referring to the sense when I am mentioning lately that my body almost becomes completely paralyzed with a stream of energy? Yes but you will find that you can localize or shall we say experiences energy as localized in the aforementioned areas and this will awaken certain ideas. The green and the violet in the sea. Concentrate on the heart area with the green and the violet on the crown. Perhaps two steels. Thank you. Shut it. Hey. Along your teaching on intention. How can I apply that within the context of the whole principle of goal setting and setting up strategies? When as you say goal setting or setting up strategies. I assume that what you are calling the goals are the intention. Therefore I am not suggesting that you cannot set up from what is available a likely course of action. But understand that many times that will distract you from what will spontaneously come up in the moment. For in the moment you will be following the agenda and perhaps many times then that attention on the agenda will then be at the expense of spontaneous opportunities that come up. So if you feel you must set up an agenda at all what you are calling a strategy. Which by the way also has the underlying implications that you are in a struggle and need to win. You may loosen up on the definitions of that agenda. Have it as shall we say a baseline guideline but not a rigid tunnel vision experience that you will not deviate from. Our ultimate suggestion would be do not in that sense create any kind of rigid agenda. But we understand that it is taught in your society that that is the most responsible way to do. Perhaps I can wake up in the morning and say given my intention what can I do today to further me in that direction. You absolutely could be. A couple of quick ones. The Zandas. For now in sticking with the aforementioned format. Is there anything else on the intention that you intend to speak about? Well the teaching amongst those that guide others in being achievers and creators is one where you set your goal. You set up a mind map of the strategy how you are going to achieve that goal. And then every today you write it to do this and projects and contacts etc. It seems that in applying your teaching the one which can still use the same strategy just be very flexible. And again understand that in the daily assessments of what is available that does bring you somewhat spontaneous for into the moment. The more you are willing to hinge on that moment the more you will accelerate your own time. Also understand as we have always shared that what I am saying is not right and the agenda setting is wrong. They are simply different approaches that both work. It would seem in your society with the timeline that you create that the setting of the goals and the list writing and fulfilling would be the fastest way for you to have the outcome that you prefer. What I am suggesting is that you may find the spontaneous approach maintaining the clear intention not side tracking from it will actually be past but both are valid and both work. And more excited. Well obviously if you are following your excitement in each moment. Thank you very much. And we share. Hey. You mentioned about timeline. An interesting thing happened this past week. Oh do you share. A friend of mine drove to Florida and he left at 11 o'clock at night. And he found himself in. He traveled to Florida and he made it in 12 hours driving time. He traveled over 1100 miles. Now he said he had these these he would blink his eyes and he would be in another state. What is so unusual about that. Well it seems like he could not drive that distance with the cars that he had. One moment. You can no longer pay that. Well you can pay. Well in our calculations. And in our business and all that we know can't be done. And the individual has simply demonstrated what we have discussed before. Perhaps somewhat in the interaction that has been entitled the recollection. Simply that in an integrated state he has created less time. And as a nice touch taken his automobile along with me. But anyone can do this. And from time to time you will hear individuals simply saying I believe and I was simply there. That will occur more and more in this transformational age. Due to the fact that one of the shall we say results of the transformation itself will be the loosening up of the typical math agreed upon agreed. And that is one example. Even though that the car traveled 1100 miles and he used gas to go that far. These are simply the details. What you may understand is that you create the time. You create the detail. You create the time for the details. So you can unclean. Do that to go to Egypt. If you wish. However perhaps you will wish to also consider reveling in every moment that you do clean. Or you are on for instance that plane for reason. With certain individuals in this case most strongly aligned with many of the ideas that you are exploring. So by simply assuming that what you are calling the journey is no different from the destination. You will have such a good time that you will create less time. And before you know it will seem as though the flight if that is what you are speaking of have gone quite quickly. And perhaps lament at the end that it was over. Oh that was so much fun. It is all again pointed to you. If you are enjoying where you are at. If you are fascinated and appreciating where you are at as a perfect expression of what you are creating at any given moment. You create less time. Okay. One more thing that happened to him. He said he stopped at a restaurant and people were sort of staring at him but not moving. Well in a sense if you are to accelerate your time frame or create less time. And then be in proximity with other individuals who still choose to create the math agreed upon stream of time. This can be the apparent. Also can be opposite occur if you shall we say slow down your creation of time. You will see them moving quite quickly. Okay. Both experiences. Oh. Realizing. Redefining. Redefining. He's quite perplexed about it. Oh well he has all the time he wishes to explain. Thank you. And who you asked for him. Shut it. Oh. I'm reading. Questions about my daughter. Oh. We had a healing done with him. What was it that you were healing? I. Or allowing her to heal. Okay I had a sense that she was too removed from her body to function well in her life. And what was the expression that led to that conclusion? Her gross motor and fine motor coordination is behind her age. Oh. This can be a reflection of loose connection of the consciousness and body. And she has trouble saying what we call on task. Or at least she has it. Now she's better with it but sometimes she has trouble really staying with what she's doing. What is her age? Seven. But more than her age. Well more than you are assigning other individuals of her age. And I had a reading with a woman who was the medical psychic she picked up the same thing and said that her perception was that Katie wasn't was caught in another dimension. Oh a consensus. I didn't exactly call it that. But I knew I just had a feeling she really wanted to be here in her body. Oh. Kim had interactions with Alie O'odham and got the same information. And Kim did a healing with me assisting and it was very exciting. I don't know all of what went on from Kim then. But there was certainly a lot more energy in Katie afterwards. I just feel that a lot is going on with her. I feel like she's coming into her own in many many ways. I. And we're interacting a little more on colors that she sees. Her third eye is very very open. And I like your perception on all of this. And then I would like to connect it with the topics that you were discussing. First of all, our understanding perhaps is that what you have created is a form of linking or perhaps you can say loosely speaking, locking of the consciousness and body. Now, when we speak about prior to the age of what you call three years old for children in your society as characteristically containing a loose connection between mind and body, allowing individuals to come and go to and from, about and out as you say. There is in general at the age of three what you would call a type of locking or joining or completion in deciding to fulfill the living of the life in a physical means more of again the establishment of the full degree of focus to allow you to experience this reality in the way that you choose to. It is our perception that this has remained loose within her to some degree. Again, perhaps to the later age that you are now sharing and symbolically from her perspective. She did expect, shall we say, what you might call the process as a form of interlocking. Therefore, you may now see many benefits in the way that you have desired from what you have done, but she has done the walking. She has done the healing, if you wish to call it that. She has chosen in that sense to now fully focus in this reality. What was this business? Do you perceive it as that she was caught in between dimensions? Well, perhaps in one sense understanding that you are all multi-dimensional being, existing simultaneously on an infinite number of levels. Perhaps loosely you can say that. The main point perhaps from your perspective is that she was loosely, shall we say, experiencing what you would call not so much other dimensions, but a similar expression to what you generally relegate to your nighttime sleep dream state. All right. So it is sense other dimensions, but dimensions closely associated with this particular dimension. When she was under some emotional stress a couple of weeks ago, she had gotten to the point where she would say a sentence and not complete the end of the sentence a few times. I noticed it and her dad noticed it. That really concerned me with it. Did she perceive that you were attentively listened? I have no idea. Perhaps it was the perception that she was not being paid attention to. And therefore it was not shall we say worth her while to even bother to continue the fall. We simply suggest again full attention upon what is being said. And the feedback or expression that it matters and this will in shall we say all likelihoods. Well, as I was part of this healing or whatever we want to call it, I feel that I got locked in in a new way. Well, in a sense. I feel very, very connected with her in a different way. And also this is fascinating, a chord that is between, I guess, all mothers and children that wasn't theoretical, I felt in experience that almost as a physical phenomena as a family was cleaning off the chord between daughter and mother, I felt like Kim could have pulled me across the room with this chord. Now, I understand what you are saying. However, to again expand upon your own analogy, if you wish to create it in the concrete form of a chord, this chord exists between all individuals. That's what I came to later tonight, tonight's later with my group. Well, now again, you may emphasize it with a particular individual and in that sense, it is a direct expression of reinforcing or asserting literally your connection, which need not being perceived in such gross terminology, but any symbol that you create will do as an analogy. You have strength in that connection. Through your willingness to co-create in that sense. And the more you are willing to continue to co-create whatever mutually excites you, the more you will seem to strengthen that particular chord or connection. All right. And now, to tie with Kim with what you're talking about today, I have the clearest sense that my daughter needs me. That's the message that she's giving me directly, verbally and through all of her behavior. At the same time, I also have an excitement about traveling and doing workshops. Before you proceed, what you perceive as a need is the overwhelming desire for love itself. Now, that may take the form of your physical presence, but that is not truly the point. If you are willing to begin to speak to her as an equal, in terms of beginning to share with her the concepts of self-unconditional love, you will allow her to hatch and nurture her own sense of self-love. That is the need in a sense that you are pursuing. It need not be so literally interpreted. Once that is awakened and nurtured within her, you will see less of a tendency to what you call cling, but still a complete open willingness and joy and desire to interact. But more from the perspective of sharing than needing something that she does not already contain. And if you fulfill something within her, understand that that means she already contained it. So drawing her attention to the fact that she already contains it all, that you love her unconditionally. That means no matter what she ever does, you will always love her. That all that is loves her unconditionally. That means no matter what she ever does, all that is will always love her. It sets up an example for her to follow with her own self-love. This is the issue. Does that make sense? Yes, and I feel that something I already have begun to talk to her about for a number of years. But I also feel that just talking about the idea that she can love herself and that God loves all that is loves her and so forth, does not substitute for her feeling that her parent is there for her. And then trying, I am balancing this with keeping a pulse on how much I can go away. And leave her when I go away on Tuesday night to do my group. She has a lot of pain about that. She comes with it but doesn't like it. And it upsets her sleep. It affects things sometimes during the next day. So I'm working on it. How do you notice to some degree? Compared to what you call your path that this has improved. That is the idea. She is now beginning slowly to acclimate and get used to the idea that you can be who you are and also still provide what she perceives she needs from you. Therefore allow yourself to see how far she has come and understand the service that you do for her in also nurturing yourself. I'm feeling more and more nurtured by being with my children. Well that will perhaps increase as you are willing to nurture yourself for you will then not draw the distinction that when you are with them it is at the cost of nurturing yourself. Then we have that be automatic and then interacting with them will actually be what is the most exciting thing. That's what has happened. So simply trust it and the timing of it and the degree of it and the specific of it. What has gone into integration now? I love being with them. I'm very nurtured by it. Well you are doing just fine. Thank you. Is that a... Yes. With tight you ask me. Shut up. My greeting is equal. Greetings. Always. You want to act? Equally. Something I forgot to mention last month I spoke to Ted Hall on the phone and he said greetings. You also. We also sent the adorable greeting and love. I figure a month away with no marriage and this moment now anyway. He told the same moment. Right. Oh wow. Great. I was like in TV early in the morning this week and they were showing the weather in words. You know things, sunny, cloudy, temperature. And then all of a sudden for a second and a half the words flashed up on the screen. The other words went away and the word came up contact alien beings on the screen. Wow. Did anybody else see it? I don't know. But I thought and I know I saw it and I'm wondering what that is. Well. What is the question? Would it a hoax or would I really... did I just see it? Well regardless of the intention you saw it. Now what do you make of it? What is the advantage you can find in it and what can you do about it? Well it was funny because I was sitting there and I had my book and I was planning out a day when I was going to go to my cave and spend some time on myself. So I was thinking of you and I was thinking of the whole situation and showing up these words come up on the screen. It was really unusual. It was exciting and I'm wondering if it was really true or did I just imagine it. Well you saw it, did you enjoy it? Yes. Congratulations. Did you remember it? No. Congratulations. So it did happen. Was it by other means? Do you mean there was a person guy in a control group that he didn't say? We find that if I in a sense share this with you I might support you. Therefore simply phone home. What does everyone say? No. Okay. That's great. Well, that's... That leads me up to my cave. I've went to my cave and last night... Were you there? Thank you. Prosy. Yes. You will be allowed the second question. Mm-hmm. Okay. I've got some questions about it because my experience last night wasn't... I labeled it not good. I said my patient was very high and I didn't get what I think I wanted. Well, again. You got something. I assume what you got you did not expect. You are now judging and assigning the meaning that it was negative. We will pause for a short break and allow you to begin to look at what was of service to you rather than what was not expected. We will then resume contact at that time with a sharing with you and perhaps you will offer to me in sight as to why it was absolutely perfect. All right? Yes. I thank you. We will return to you after your break and resume contact after approximately perhaps 10 to 15 minutes of your counting.
