 How may I say, how are you all the seasoning of your time as you create time to exist? Are you all right? Thank you very much. We begin this interaction, this evening of your time with the notion that there are throughout the multiverse, which shall we say our updated terminology for what you label the universe? Many, many, many different forms, different styles, different expressions, as you say, of consciousness. Yours being a particular focus, a particular representation of a choice of style of experiencing reality. In your particular case, shall we say, you create as far as the scale within the relative realities to yours, a very finite, a very solid reality. You are near, shall we say, the end of the need to experience physicality, and are what we label very arbitrarily within what we would again label third density, or you have labeled third dimensions, but density, shall we say, is a bit more precise. We, our civilization, is what we would label fourth density. The last, shall we say, density within this particular octave of existence to be physical. Fifth density is the idea of the first gradation, if you will, of non-physicality. There are, but a few differences, shall we say, in the ideas of between third and fourth density. But you have chosen to experience it, and are indeed at the time exploring, is a bit more of a limited point of view. It is a very valid expression, and takes in that way very bold souls to be able to impose upon themselves that much forgetfulness. In terms of your natural, shall we say, connection or extension more precisely of yourself from what you label God, what we prefer to call and feel is a bit more precise, or all that is. Therefore, you do choose in that way to experience certain limitations. One of the limitations we wish in that way to discuss this evening of your time will be contained within what we shall suggest will be the title, if you will, of tonight's interaction. It's about time. Four in many real sense we will discuss briefly the idea of how it is that you do create time. When we say you create your own reality, and as shall we say, become quite a catch-threes within the new age of your planet, we mean it, and we mean it literally, and 100%. Now very many of you will say, well, it's very nice. I do assume I have some control over my affairs, but not really 100% all right. That too is a belief. However, recognize from our standpoint that it is 100% that you do create your own reality. Even again, if you use 90% of your creative with to make it seem though you're only using 10%, in fact, you are still using the full 100%, and any steamingness that you may have that you do not entirely create your own reality, well shall we say the paradox to that is you are creating that seeminglyness, so it still goes back to you. The idea you labeled time, many of you may not realize, is also part of your creation. You have heard the fact, or shall we say the same, that physical reality is an illusion. This time, in that sense, is an illusion. From the perspective of all that is or God, it may seem illusory, but let's face it. When you are choosing to create it, it seems quite real. This however does not mean at all that you are not creating it, simply that you are that good at creating it. One of the purposes, and again there are many for you to create time, is the idea of discovery, of being able to, as you started, progress, of being able to not know, find out, and then know. And you do very literally create time from yourself. An example, you have the saying in your society that time flies by when you are having fun. Well in fact it may seem in that sense to fly, but that is not the precise mechanism. The mechanism involved in that instance is that you actually create less time. Therefore, if two of your hours have passed by your clock, shall we say, and you have only experience, shall we say, 20 minutes. In fact you have only aged physiologically 20 minutes, you have created in that sense less time, by being in the moment. The paradox truly is, shall we say, from the viewpoint of the infinite, and also exponentially from your own viewpoint exponentially. The only actual existing time is now, always now. You create the idea of an illusion of a continuum. Not in that sense, recognizing that in each and every given moment you entirely recreate your own reality. You do so in such a similar way along that path of gradating it that you create the illusion of continuity. The reason we are bringing to your attention at this time, the idea that you do create time, is because you use it in many ways. And some of them we sense have, as you say in your terminology, tricks you up. So what I was now to present to you one of the ideas in which or one of the ways in which you use time, that you now, by simply being made aware of it, will have the option to change if you design. Again, we do not insist that you have too much fun, it is up to you. The idea will be again as follows. Because you only do exist in the here and now, as you have heard, by extension you have created the illusion that now the presence is actually experientially a result of the past. And we will in that sense by extension result in the future. That however is but a standpoint, is but a viewpoint. From our perspective and how we have chosen to create it in that way consciously, you always only exist in the now and create or recreate the past from the present. This is quite demonstrable in that in any time you are quote reflecting on your past, you are actually recreating a scenario about what you perceive that your past was, but in the present, in the now. Recognize that experientially however, this is not the case other than that definition you decided. For the way that you create your reality as we had opened up by saying and as you have heard many times, it's through your belief systems which you have also heard. Believing in that sense is speaking for when you believe something, you act as an individual that believes that. You have chosen to become physical and your actions in your physical life are what creates your own reality. Therefore you dictate in that sense your actions according to your beliefs, therefore any belief you have because you act as though you have it is for you a reality or so shall we say does it seem to be. By operating on the premise that the present is the result of the past, you recreate your present however in a way that binds you to that very past. The reason we again are bringing it up in this light is very open, it is a past you do not prefer. And therefore you do perceive in that way that things are happening to you now because of something which happened in the past. Now the only reason in that sense that it appears that way is because you believe that it must and you are actually recreating in the present in the now that scenario as being a result of the past. And again it only is because of your definition, because of your belief system. Now we begin to offer to you as many times to members of yours decide the notion that the present is not exponentially again exponentially speaking a result of the past. You always have in any given now moment everything that you need in order to do whatever it is with integrity that excites you at any given moment. In that sense you are a complete and full toolbox and then on those shall we say tools that you must go to the store and buy. It is all there right now which again is the only time that is. The idea of the future is standing this out shall we say linearly in the other direction is that there is no one be future. It is that there are infinite probabilities of futures each of which on some level of all that is will be lived down. If you decide in that way to take a right down the roads of your life instead of a left end a particular shall we say pork some portion of your consciousness on some level which will not be immediately apparent to your conscious self as you are now will have taken the left and which it out. And this is what we have labeled probable reality. However you always get to pick which reality you will exist within. Therefore rather than there being a future to predict in a sense everything that is possible and probable is out there as a possibility. So it isn't so much what will the future be as which future will you choose. You can begin now to decide that everything that does occur within your life is in every given moment every now moment a choice anyway. And what this implies is that you have the power by extension again to make another choice which you always do. When you begin to reflect on the idea that the present is not a result of the past. You free yourself up from using that path in a sense as an elaborate excuse to continue to do things you do not prefer. But there is no real momentum behind those things you are recreating them in the now and in that sense very really perpetuating them as a choice and you do not have to. Now there are many ways we are not saying you cannot certainly you can certainly within your society many do and still in that sense continue to create their reality. But if you feel your path binds you up you may wish to cling to the option we are all for it now for it is all again simply a belief. When you will recognize again that you have everything in any now moment and become the you you wish to be now not using things you did in your past as an excuse why you cannot. Another interesting thing will seem to occur that past will seem to have changed. For when you read it find who you are in the now moment by extension you must have had a slightly different path to be the different new you. So therefore in any now moment when you do transform when you do change you do in that sense change your entire path and your entire future automatically anyway. And then in that sense you can have shall we say the past that will allow you to have the present you desire. One technique that we shall suggest which is very simple in working or playing which we prefer to label with this idea of redefining the relationship of past present and future is what we shall label. All right retroactive reconstruction and it is very very simple. You do in that sense again perpetuate your now reality very many times by what you have done in your past and again that sense find yourself to that past. Oh I am the type of person that does this type of thing because I've always done it that way and therefore I always probably will. All right but that is simply again a definition if you wish to now begin to play with these ideas then this retroactive reconstruction will come in quite handy. For the idea that there is nothing anymore real about what you perceive your path was then what you perceive you wish it was. Remember you are running up and recreating a path in the present as you change although you are not always conscious of this you even recreate that path slightly differently. You watch on to different things that happen that allows you to be the you you are now so you can see that the path even fluctuates in your usage of it. What you can do which you may find it is very helpful and it's very interesting from our perspective is to recreate a path that you prefer by doing this simply establish who it is you wish to be. You use your imagination to conjure up the image of who it is you wish to be. Your imagination is very good at this and you will find it to be quite cooperative in this way. When in fact you have gotten a solid image of this idea then use that same imaging to create the path that that individual would have needed to have in order to have that present. If you will now plug that path into your own framework say for instance for you to be the person that you wish to be you feel it would take you ten years. Simply create a memory ten years ago that you had begun to in that sense begin to do that thing. What you will find is it is very easy to reassign that new path that will then make it okay acceptable to have the present that you now desire for you can now say it came from the path that led up to it. Now we realize this may seem like juggling, haft dancing around with semantics and it can be just that but it can be far more if you are willing to allow it to be because you simply again do that right now simply using again what you perceive to be your path to perpetuate things you do not prefer in your presence. This works very well if you have what you label a this ease process that would take as you say five years to heal. Regress in the old imagination back to five years ago and begin that healing then that will then make it acceptable to be healed now and the key is this when you do that when you go through that whole imaging. And come to the now person that you prefer to be all you need to all you need to to be that person now is to act like you are already that person and if you need have it with that pass. This works for it is again how you already do it and again what you perceive to be your past is not etched in stone you are recreating it you are changing it you are dis you are disstorting it you are morphing it if you perceive there was something quite traumatic in your childhood and you must relive that. Watch how we say to what that does not make very much sense you already live it then you already explored it then you already got what you needed then you can create the need to do it again now but recognize you again are creating it and you do not have to unless the course you prefer. So it will be in that sense always up to you now similarly again when you change the now you are in the present by extension your future projection will change but by beginning to live now here and now you will allow yourself to be awake in the reality you have chosen to experience very much or very often the offset that many of you say you create stems from the path you did not prefer. Re-assign the new meaning and you will get the new present. As you begin in that sense to live in the now and do what it is that is most reflected in any given moment of who you are as we have said you actually create less time and henceforth age in that way in a slower fashion so in order to if it is desirable to you to expand the span of your life all you need to do is stay in the year and now when you do create what if scenarios when you do spend much of your time pondering the past you are negating the present that you are now creating so simply if you will re-establish your relationship with the present you will always know in any given moment what is available to you at that present since those are the only things you can act on anyway why bother to worry about the future what if and the past I wish it wasn't you can in any given moment that you feel yourself being swept away by this again recognize that it is a choice take a few deep breaths relax don't allow yourself to become re-active allow yourself to explore in any given moment what you are thinking how you are feeling what you must be believing to feel that way if a reaction quote reaction is about to happen that you do not remove recognize that that reaction in and of itself is a choice in the moment and again what that implies is there are other choices very often when you create great upset you are not allowing yourself the awareness of the other choices shall we say if your choice is even between getting upset and one of the other choices is to not get upset if you allow yourself to see that that is another choice I would imagine you may be more prone to pick it and this will give you the chance in that sense to break free globally speaking of what you label momentum that you feel has trapped you into doing things you do not prefer but remember you are creating that in any given moment so simply now in this given moment we thank you for the opportunity to share with your civilization in this way it enriches us greatly to be able to be exposed to that much more of creation that many more ways that all that is expresses itself through infinite creation and we appreciate very much the opportunity to be able to appreciate your consciousness to share with you to co-create with you and for that privilege that you have allowed me in that sense to partake of I ask you now how may I be of service to you sharing I have a sharing I will ask you to take you to share what you said was quite appropriate for me and solely in any other future now I have a question and time I have to talk about five to eleven different things which is really deep because I have been working on something for quite a while and that really helps a lot another paradox about time shall we say is when you are willing to be in the year and now you actually do experience an ex-federalization which may feel in that sense at times that you are moving faster thank you very much for sharing and thank you very much for willing to be an example of a bold individual making a statement for you do not have to in any way shape and form ask questions of us we will in that sense respect and indeed relish a statement from any of you at any time and again we thank you for sharing your gift with regards to energy I assume that the communications you have with us are some sort of energy being transferred from the fourth dimension in a sense loosely speaking yes are there any other forms of energy that are regularly transferred what are they like and what are they what are they in a sense the way we view reality is that it is holographic what this means is that any given point contains the totality the potentiality for every other point so in that way any energy that exists that is at all of similar vibration to that of your planet is shall we say somewhat inert and palpable in terms of precise descriptions of the styles and types of energies we would need a more specific question and there may be some difficulty in translation due to the vocabulary of the channel but shall we say within these interactions what is in that sense being transmitted is thought and what is occurring from shall we say the resonant tuning of the channel to myself is a type of what you would label empathy being as and creating in that sense the same thought at the same time that is more the mechanism for what you label telepathy we prefer to call telepathy you don't actually read each other's thoughts simply have an empathic bond that allows you to create the same thought at the same time is that something that can be trained for like it is something that I can how would I facilitate that ability in my time in a sense you're labeling of training do notes effort paradoxically it is loosening up lightning up and not forcing but allowing that allows this to occur so in that sense training is available but not necessary simply your willingness to quiet yourself down ask the questions that you do design an answer and then accept the answers as they come in and here's the key again validating them as they come in if you invalidate them you interrupt the process you stop the flow in that way if you are willing to validate what you get you are establishing a dialogue does that sound like I can lighten up my own heaviness by doing the process you said before about going back a few years whatever I deem necessary only absolutely and it is a very strong in that way shall we say process we are not in that way process only as it has a design for we operate in what you would label spontaneity to the extreme but we recognize within your explanation that you desire processes so therefore from time to time when the timing does in that sense allow me to provide them anything in that sense that will allow you to put into action what it is we speak of is the only way you will experience it anyway again the difference between sounds nice and it really works is your willingness to apply it not just talk about it so therefore when will you do it? you know our choosing of time is what has us created this all the process to all ventilate and indeed that is what you require to have a process but you can now recognize as you move into the fourth density which is what is occurring in your new age transformation that you will let and let have processes for there is really no difference between having a thought and being that far other than the fact that you create the necessity for processes and you will not allow yourself to be the new person without the process that allows you to validate the new person but that is simply a definition and you can by having the thought at that moment by definition you are that thing now will you recreate the old you or continue now to recreate the new preferred new does that make sense? absolutely hope thank you very much I love the question I just want to thank you last time and Woodbury I saw you my son and I did some of the visualizations and validations and working very well and we thank you as well for again your willingness to apply what it is we speak on for again we can never prove who it is that we think we are adding that sense it is not even our goal to do so but I guarantee 100% that it will work if you will apply it so therefore it is always your choice to discover whether it works thank you very much Chen Chen Chen Yes you I knew Can you observe our kind of where you want it? If we design it is not in that sense always necessary but it is an option you have a more specific question along these lines recognize that my job colloquially speaking we have no jobs per se it is to establish communications with many societies so in my particular instance I have been communication with many societies now we do not in that sense consistently monitor anyone's society but because we live in what we label positive synchronicity we are always where we need to be when we need to be there we are always interacting with exactly who we need to be interacting with at any given moment and always have 100% trust in the moment we do not have what you label upon your planet doubt not the shadow of one it does not exist in our realms it is not part of the equation with which through we create ourselves incidentally you too don't really have doubt for there is really no such thing as doubt doubt is not a lack of trust doubt is an infinite trust in that which you do not prefer so simply you can't begin to be conscious of what this you want to trust in and if you find yourself trusting in things you do not prefer that is an opportunity to see what you believe what must I believe to be trusting in this thing I do not prefer if you will be honest with yourself and track down what it is you do believe that the only way you can change and believe by first owning it you cannot change what you do not own but once you do own it which may mean admitting to yourself which may mean denying a particular thing to yourself that is always the first step and the only real doorway to changing it and so we thank you so Michelle when we are conscious of a doubt then can we validate that I mean if we invent you now recognize that it is not that you have a lack of trust in the thing you desire that that doubt is again a trust in something you don't prefer and if you will strain your attention over to why am I trusting in this thing I don't prefer you will be able to nail down beliefs that may no longer serve you again enabling you to change them does that make sense? does that help? yes thank you very much good now I'd like to try I'd like you to welcome you here to what I consider to be a sacred space and I'd like to ask you about the electromagnetic fields around Andrew and how you integrate your energy into or beyond his fear and what color you project as we see color here in a sense the color may be somewhat arbitrary and be perceived differently by different individuals shall we say if we were to perceive it and I am now being very colloquial then shall we say a bit of a translation difficulty here from our perspective the component of our energy would be somewhat green the idea of the interaction however is that the communications between myself and I recognize I am pointing to the body of the channel but you understand and you all take place multi dimensionally therefore you hear the words I am saying you see some of the spillover energy that is not expressed in the words in the hands in the gestures of the channel this is another form of enhancing the communications in that way but there is also what you would label or it can change again loosely speaking and this occurs because the conversations are not only taking place with me and your physical self but your higher self which you create a separation from you are actually are your higher self but you perceive that it is without you or you have descended from it we are conscious of being our higher self so therefore I will dialogue with many of you on the shall we say higher self level and this information will shall we say drift into your experiential reality as it needs to your higher self not having the consideration of timing we are able to give it all to you at that point but your physical self having chosen to experience timing will then allow those aspects of our communications to come in where and when they need to in perfect timing another level that we interact with your society upon is what you label your sleeping dream reality because our physical waking reality is a bit similar to your dream reality more similar shall we say than this waking reality that you have and in that sense now we may also introduce the idea that from our perspective your sleeping dream reality is just that reality not hallucination not mental wandering not your mind releasing its excess energy and allowing yourself to live out the things of the day that is an idea we are not invalidating it in an instant it is partially the mechanism for some of the realities you choose to create but that is no less real than this for recognize you are dreaming right now wake up and live the dream when you no longer need to make the separation between the parameters of your sleeping dream and this waking dream that is when the idea of sleep in your society will become vestigial or necessarily a nightlife obsolete we in that sense do not sleep the way you do we can choose to create that symbol from time to time but in that sense have no reason to do so for in our reality our sleeping dream and waking dream are one experience we do not separate them and invalidate the sleeping dream therefore now you have that option also yes thank you very much I just I have one more where where is your physicality now right now on your here right now I am aboard my scout craft or bring my planet of that society I am in a state of repose or lying down you will I'm what we label a projection table V and I use this term Betty with sleep and it is the closest you have within your vernacular at this time computer of my ship is linked directly to my mentalities we do not have what you label keyboards mouse and we are directly linked with that computer and again because it is self-aware I almost refrain from using that terminology but it will give you at least a rudimentary understanding that computer in a way gives me the acceptable symbol to be able to project my consciousness in a technological way now we are able in that sense to do it without the mechanism but very many society such as your own shall we say are more active believe it with the equipment so we hold on to the symbols and in fact our physicality the remnants of our physicality so we have some common ground in which to interact with you oh thank you very much share it yes could you talk about love and your connection and what is life here all right thank you very much we will recently ask this similar question the idea being that from our perspective unconditional love is what all creation is actually made of when you speak of the light of infinite creation that light is unconditional love in order in that sense for you to exist all that is all that is must contain the concept of unconditional love for all that is or gone will love you no matter what you do there are no conditions upon the love so in that sense there are the separations of love conditional love and unconditional love we do not experience what you label conditional love so therefore I speak only from experience about unconditional love another way in which you may view the idea of unconditional love is the ultimate appreciation allowing anything to be what it is exactly as it is without feeling you need to change it now that does not mean you cannot desire change desire different exploration desire expansion but again that will only occur by your allowance and not forcing something to happen which you never actually can your creativity is quite automatic and functions through allowance so therefore unconditional love is your willingness to view something for how it relates to you and how in that sense it can be a service to you very often a similar is quite obvious what is negative we need that point that out but if you will allow yourself to now glean what might be positive since I created this thing why did I created for a positive reason you begin to appreciate all your creation and that is a demonstration in that way of unconditional love what you label your free will is in a very real sense one of the highest expressions of the unconditional love of God for again he will love you and I speak colloquially saying he obviously it is not a he solely but contains both energy no matter what you do certain individuals in your society do not believe that I believe God have the club and if you're good you're good however that is not our perspective does not help shake your face what do you use spacecraft in that sense again as a physiological symbol so that you can't relate to us and the many other society in that way however and because your society in that way is going toward that technology however you as well as have the ability to quote loosely seeking travel without one in what you label your actual state does that happen and if not please pursue that my understanding is that I personally create your future here that's my personal earth says the mankind itself creates the earth and that's the maybe called the macro earth the mankind earth what does it take to for mankind to a certain percentage of people to create a better earth or a preferred earth enough you will only ever experience that by changing yourself or again all options are available to anybody which ever approach you take will determine what earth you are on along with the portion if individuals contain that portion of individuals that are of that vibration again you can only experience a reality you are the vibration up so therefore you will always attract those vibrations to you that in some way drive if you will with your vibration so by changing in that sense your own world you will be on that world and the individuals around you will be the ones that have also chosen in that way to share that commonality can you be a bit more specific? I'm interested in the dynamics of for instance I'm aware of many disastrous scenarios I don't prefer a disastrous scenario I prefer that things transform magically and as painlessly as possible but academically you must own your creation of the tragic scenarios before you can change and do that so it is not that that is not available to you but that you will never in that sense transform it by attempting to get rid of it you cannot as we have said get rid of anything you are the entire universe where will you get rid of it too it is always a matter of transforming integrating allowing yourself to redefine, reestablish your relationship with any given concept and transforming so when you will begin in that sense not to ask such a question but own the quote tragic reality my reading is now that I must ask myself why I created a lot of solutions why I created the new layer in that sense you may wish to instead of running away from what it is you do not desire walking toward that which you do that does not then place the emphasis on the things you do not desire live in an environmentally sound way be the environment of that idea you will attract others around you of like mine and you will begin to see the changes you desire on the six o'clock news which is what we think if you are speaking up however do not validate do not only be willing to validate those changes if they come on the six o'clock news be willing to validate them now you will not transform anything by invalidating it you will transform it by recognizing that everything is a symbol when you do not get the message you have created a symbol for it seems to hang around when you do that is what allows it to have served this purpose and transformed all right all right but further one thing in order to own the tragic scenarios would be sufficient for me as an individual simply to one moment may I make a suggest not an absence to me but you are then well aware of one of the main concepts that we impart that being that every situation every every is you say every I think you know that situation is fundamentally polite neutral void as you say that you assign the meaning you assign the terms the effect you get out because you act as though you believe it so are you going to continue to label them tragic scenarios or are you going to see them as neutral occurrences where my individuals who have chosen to live out specific realities are doing so and here's the key clean how it relates to who you are that is allowing it to be a service to you that is owning why you created not continuing to ponder it as a tragedy it is an a an time approach you only see it as a tragedy because you are not an absence willing to own it you wish to believe it to be extraneous but by definition nothing in creation is extraneous how could it be if it's there it must need to be there thank you so a workable approach to world change them individual change individual change others will seem to change the world will seem to change but it is always you being the person you are at any given moment again attract the portion of any individuals you are in contact with that corresponds to that vibration of where you are at when you change your vibration they also exist on these other levels and you get to partake of those levels with those individuals which had them seeming to change they have not they have always been there with that vibration now you are choosing to interact with it and you are by the way quite a cat all around the stage I have a fantastic idea for preferred earth that I would like to create all right well my piece and viable very viable mass ways to create that are you wish to have and then simply decide to be or not to be it is complicated as you wish we will allow you to make it as complicated as you wish however it is that simple and that is just as valuable as it must be very complicated do you wish again to pursue the complication of this matter no I don't know if I don't find a thing in that if I work designed to bring a lot of friends into my world with me it will be automatic you will not have to in excess feet responsible for the details as we understand when you have cleared intention the details take care of themselves when you focus on the details you have hold them firmly there and do not let them flow do not let them continue to be the only constant in reality is change the only effort you need to exert if you allow something in that sense to remain the same it will change automatically when you lighten up on loose and you're good ok a few people saw television a man of a clock speaking in a new age approach oh right I was hiding he claimed it was to me he claimed three different things that our scientists are now seeing one that every single DNA cell knows the totality of the It is an example of the holographic nature of reality. Okay, number two, that every cell in our body knows our total body. Number three, that every brain cell knows the total memory of our brain. Did you comment further on that? In the sense again, and you simply any symbol of the holographic nature of reality has expressed through your physicalized body. At physically speaking, this is what allows what you label as cloning to occur. That a cell would contain the totality of the being. It is simply a physicalized reflection of the holographic nature of reality. Okay, that would all those different cells will die. Then we're open. We have not shown you understand the question for the way you have structured your body to be constantly being replenished. Do you mean when you physically die and the last one dies? Yeah, because what they have in terms of knowledge of our body, our brain, our reality. Thank you very much, we understand. Shall we say, co-op really speaking, or again, this is a bit colloquial. It is reabsorbed into the totality of who you are, your high of cells. Not necessarily shall we say the animalistic functions, but in that sense the intelligence gleaned from having led the life. I think that answers an old one. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Good to go. I wonder if you can share with us some insight into the corn fields in England. Again, not to open your presence for you, but they are an elaborate code. They are some of them, extraterrestrial in nature. The way to have some fun with the code is to collect, as you say, pictures of them. The channel has been recently made away of the idea that there is a book of such pictures. By paying attention to the chronology of their colors, several interacting things will make themselves available. But again, it is a gift to your society, and we will not in that sense unwrap it, other than to say that there is something in that way to be green and discovered from those symbols. Some of them are, shall we say, made by members of your society, but others are not. Are these benevolent extraterrestrials? Oh, again, any one that you would consider to be in contact with your planet at this time is what you would label, but ever. There are no in that sense negative extraterrestrials pervading your planet from our perspective. And we fear, when that sense, that we have a bit of a good look. Recognizing general negative society will experience much turmoil in conflict, and in general, in general, will not be able to develop the technology to make it out this fall in space. But once, however, that do, because again, you can only experience reality, or the vibration of, will attract themselves to similar, quote, negative worlds. So in that sense, they exist within a different dimensionality than you altogether. Simply, if you will remain oriented positively and remain of that vibration, that places you literally in a separate dimensional reality, where they cannot perceive you. They have nothing in common. Is that a decision? Oh, thank you very much. Good morning. Yes. This is a fun question. Oh, why are they all wrong? When the past three years, I've been trying to explain. They were supposed to suggest. I've been trying to explain. I've been asking, if I picture, I've been moving way, the past three years, I think it's possible I might wake up tomorrow morning with 30 pound letters. I think it's definite, but your wording of the question denotes to me that you do not really think it's possible. Again, when you are playing with belief systems, you must be honest about what you truly believe is likely, and that is how you will begin to be able to change it. But you have begun by saying to me that you have been trying to lose weight. We would simply say that all the trying is not the doing of the thing, but the doing of trying. And you word that way, your words in that sense do represent that in some portion of your consciousness you are trying and not doing it. But may I ask you a question? Are you doing in your life what excites you the most? No. What are you waiting for? No. No. In that sense, that is one of the symbols for why individuals in your planet create excess weight, and simply a coincidence of your language that they are waiting around to do what excites them. One other idea is that individuals begin to accelerate their energy and interesting phenomenon of color, which is very curious to us. Individuals get the sense that when they wake up into their newfound power, that it will be too much for them to handle. This in a sense baffles us, but we are now beginning to understand this idea. So when individuals feel in that sense that they are too powerful, too accelerated, they will literally ground themselves with that symbol. Do either of these seem to apply? Yes. Oh, thank you. Oh, thank you very much. If you are willing to apply what we are saying, you will have a miraculous result that you have not seen before, but you have not in that sense approached it this way before. The ways you have approached it have not worked, as you say. Therefore, simply be willing now to be open to looking at new possibilities and recognizing that when we say you create your reality 100%, we even mean the weight. So therefore, look at your beliefs, look at what it is you are believing. Life with from our perspective, the symbol of food putting weight on an individual is from a belief system. Now, we recognize it as a popularly held belief system on your planet. So many individuals will simply say, no way, Vishang. But what I am saying is no less of a reality than that massive Greek upon reality. Recognize this across the board. All aspects of creation, all dimensions, all chosen experiences have one law of creation in common. In that sense, there is truly only one law, irrefutable, immutable law of creation. That is, what you put out is what you get back. Period. Within given reality, there are consensually agreed upon conventions. So what you perceive to be the laws of physics upon your planet are simply consensual realities. Agreements between individuals to experience that type of imposition. You can break free of the popular notion at any given moment, simply that individuals who strongly buy into it and have agreed in that sense to experience it may seem to disappear from your reality if they have not chosen to perceive it. So you will not in that sense be breaching anybody's reality by drastically and quickly changing your own. But you may hang out with different people. Does that make sense? Yes, yes. Thank you very much. Do you have another question? Oh, it's the magnet. Oh, it's the magnet. Magnet. What about? It means that magnet. Does it have any reality in your direction? Oh, yes. The idea of electromagnetism is very, shall we say, involved in our technology for re-understanding. The idea of music is in that sense somewhat of a universal symbol, also, although the expressions of it vary greatly from civilization to civilization dimension to dimension. Upon our planet we have what you would label loosely forms of music, but we do not have radio, top 10 hits. Again, we are very spontaneous, so it is always a spontaneous creation. We also in that sense have very simple things around us, are very in tune without environment. So we do not have in that sense electric guitar. But we do have the idea of you with labels, string instruments, wood instruments, bell-like instruments, and they are played by particular individuals when it excites them from time to time, and they will always think rhythmistically attract exactly that audience that they need to appreciate. Does that answer the question? Thank you very much. Hey. Nine years ago I experienced something that was quite interesting, and I had a car accident. Oh, right. At this time, remember covering above the body in a waiting stage, and then not going to leave, but almost in the spot of coming. Didn't take much of it. After that, I love the hospital, and my life changed. I was different. I was different to my family, the people that I knew that were supposed to be close weren't. And I felt very much like an outsider to the very end. You know, you redefined yourself and therefore your relationship to those around you. Very often in your society, one common symbol is what you label your car class for individuals who will not believe they can suddenly change. When they jar their physicalized bodies in that label, then accept a sudden change. You were in that sense completely rewired, if you will, upon that impact. You can have an immediate opportunity to perceive another level of your consciousness by what you are labeling the floating. Then by when reintegrating that was a recreated being. And therefore again would attract different beings and have different relationships with the same beings if they are that much different from the new being that you are. Recognize that any relationship once established always goes on. Simply changes its face, changes its relevance significance to who you are at any given moment, but it is an infinite creation once established. During that accident also the body suffered injury to the neck and to the back. And none of our quote unquote medical technology has taken care of it, how best can I alleviate it? Thank you very much. For our definition of pain is that pain is what you create as a product of resistance. In that sense, resisting who it is you most truly are. Resisting being the fullest you you can be. The truest reflection of who it is you have chosen to be. As we have said your sign of what that is is what excites you. In that way it gets you very excited is the physicalized translation of the vibratory energy of that which you chose to be in this lifetime. So if you will now recognize this being introduced to it begin to allow yourself to unfold as you are not doing what other people expect and only being willing to be who you are. You will find those symbols of resistance which produces friction which can result in pain will disappear. How are you doing what excites you the most in life? Our what is that time? What is the thing that I am doing what is that excite me? It is the thing that you are doing that is the most exciting thing you can take up. I am here. Thank you very much. I am feeling comfortable with it. I am not playing about what the next moment is going to be. What we simply mean by that is though in life. There are two shall we say diversification of the idea of excitement. The thing which excites you the most in life is one but that may not be immediately available to you. So how to get there as you say the quickest is in any given moment allowing yourself to view all options available and only choosing from those options. The thing with with in integrity that excites you the most that will set the straightest line to that overall thing which excites you the most. And in any given moment you will be most fully who it is that you have chosen to be. All your ideas of resistance will then fall by the wayside and you will transform your ideas of pain. But what other ideas? We understand when you have pain in your society. Many individuals will say well the pain is ruining my life. It does not allow me to do this. It does not allow me to do that. And then they do not look at what it has actually allowed them to do in that if they hadn't had the pain they wouldn't be able to do. By shifting your perspective in owning why you are creating this pain and allowing that symbol to be obvious to you. You can now create that symbol another way and that has a necessity for the symbol of pain to keep bringing it to your attention. So therefore may I ask you what has and again I know this is foreign to you in general within your society but whenever we ask an individual they immediately come up with very many obvious answers. What has this pain allowed you to do? To me that I am loving people. Oh right. Do you understand? Now the ideas you do not have to continue to create it. Go out and meet other loving people first. In exactly what we do. Now there may be if we were to pursue this which we will not be allowed to do it on your own. Other obvious things. But there are other ways to create those things. Begin to do it and you will awaken without the pain. It will have out lived in that sense it's useful but symbols do not hang around to tease you to be obnoxious. They are crying. They are your children in that sense crying for your attention. If you are placing attention upon it and they are still there guess why. That is not what they are saying. So allow yourself to adjust to what it is that they may be saying. When you sit upon the thing that they are saying it will disappear. It will transform. It will integrate into your whole mess. And it is that simple. If you will allow it to be. You talk about my finding loving people as one way. Is there a way that you can get this child inside me a person or right direction and to get the hand. Oh get the point. Again. In any given moment from what is available to you do what excites you the most. This can be viewed and it is sometimes by members in your society as frivolity. But you do not have to. You can realize that it is just you giving yourself in no uncertain terms and indication of who you are. You have become very used to living out of obligation. Not simply you, many in your society. And by this obligatory shall we say orientation. Very many times if not most you will choose from what is available what you are obligated to do rather than what excites you. So you never allow yourself to set up the momentum of one exciting thing leading to the next. You allow yourself to set up the momentum of one obligation leading to the next. It works just as well with excitement as it does with obligation. The paradox being that when you live by your excitement you are by being who you are most truly by definition going to be supported by your own life. You are willing to be supported by the universe so your quote obligations will be met far more efficiently far more effortlessly and with a lot more. Does that make sense? Yes. One more thing. Oh, thank you. I have been looking for a writing poem and I found that one that makes me extremely excited about it. I'm not even talking about it. There's just one. One more. One more. Sorry. The pro-path to the fore the word book. The roasting of cash flow. Here in our reality a lot of this requires money. All could change. A very often you fixate on the idea of money not recognizing that abundance our definition of abundance is the ability to do what you need to do when you need to do it. Now you can say you will only accept it in money but money was not part of my original description. Your abundance will come to you in many ways. If you will again loosen up, allow your abundance to come in what way it will. Allow other options of how to do the same thing to be utilized. Does this make sense? Oh. When you begin to do this, you by accepting your abundance from the universe in whatever way it will come, we'll see that the universe will keep flowing you that abundance. Because you are accepting its gift, it that much more willingly will give you more gifts. By saying I will only accept it as money, you are creating a type of shall we say tunnel vision. And the things that may allow you to do that thing may be on the sides of that tunnel vision. By opening up the possibilities of allowing your abundance to simply be that ability, you will recognize in any given situation you always have had that ability. But that you have made certain choices of this is more important, this is an obligation and so forth. Not being a true reflection of who you are and perpetuating shall we say the unextatic explosion of obligation. Oh, my goodness. I'm going to help you. Oh, thank you very much. Yeah. Okay, so we're there. One moment or two. After the shedding, we will pause for a break. After the break. You. Go on. After energy chillers, and this past February, I got such a headache in a chain. And when I came out of the chain on the headache, it was such a success. Couldn't stop my hospital eyes. So about nine days. Oh, yeah. After the hospitalization, I'll begin to see things that, on there I'll look at the person to see what they will need to say. Or tell a person I think I'm dying tomorrow or in a scene. And I was just wondering what the headache was, is playing out what I was supposed to see, to let people know that they are safe, what they've done for them. In a sense, but more appropriately, this idea. When you change your beliefs, when you become a new person, in your society, you constantly make the comparison between the new person and the old one. And this creates a friction. In that sense, you view your new self sometimes through older belief systems. By doing this, you can sometimes create this symbol from that friction of pain. But in that sense, you do not have to do it. You can look at, as you have that headache, as the symbol for when you began to be the new you. But on some level, still had some resistance for being that new you. Now, I assume you have accepted that new you and the pay has subsided. You have, in that sense, from what we can perceive, allowed yourself to create a grace gift. And by sharing it, you will enrich not only yourself, but the other two interact with. Simply one thing that we may suggest is recognizing that, again, everybody creates their own reality 100%. So in a sense, when you quote, heal somebody, if you want to get technical about it, you're not really healing them. They're healing themselves using you as an acceptable symbol to do so. The reason I point this out to you is not in any way, shape, or form to say that what you have is not a gift for the locating of the problem, quote, is in that sense very helpful, but so that you will always realize that what you are allowing individuals to do is to heal themselves. And this is a great service. What you do with your energy work is to simply provide a most conducive atmosphere, rounded about that person, to allow them the option if they choose to acceptively heal themselves. Doesn't help. Yes, thank you. Oh, thank you very much. At this time, we will pause for a short break of 10 to 15 of the old minutes and resume contact at that time. Bye.
