 All right, I'll say before we continue, allow me to expand upon a particular point that was mentioned at the beginning of the interaction. We understand again that there is this notion, that there is the achievement upon the living of the life, the striving for upon the living of the life for what you label perfection. And again, there are some accompanying concerns that the achievement of this perfection will result in the loss of your individuality, in fact, the absorption of your personality, of your identity, into the identity of all that is. Allow us now to expound from a slightly different direction on the following idea. From our perspective, perfection is not something to be earned or gained, or pursued or achieved. You are always perfect. You are always a perfect reflection of whatever it is. You are exploring in any given moment and do not minimize this perfection. You will always grow. You will always expand. And we understand from this perspective, it may seem a bit overwhelming to think that when you have expanded as much as you can possibly picture, you will continue to grow and expand, but you will. You will always continue to be a perfect reflection of whatever stage or step or exploration that you are embarking upon. Therefore, you are already perfect. Many times when individuals speak about achieving perfection, it is simply an arbitrary, external set of standards. And in that sense, individuals not choosing to manifest those standards are judged both by society and both by themselves. But you need not denigrate yourself in that way. You may understand the nature of perfection, that you are always a perfect reflection. You will continue to be an expression of the perfection of your exploration and you will always continue to grow. You will always maintain what you label to be your individuality and as you do expand and perhaps realize that realities that you seem to be within are actually within you, you will always have some sense of self unless you decide you do not wish to. So therefore nothing is ever taken from you. You never get to the point where you achieve something and then it is all taken away. Even in your language, even with your logic, this does not make sense. Therefore allow me now to interact with the perfection that each and every one of you are. And I ask you now how may we serve you. Shitting. I am blessed that you said that I am perfect at this moment because I was afraid to ask this question so now I will ask. Thank you very much for now being an expression of your perfection. Yes, I am proud to be that too. You have been helping me with getting in touch with my spirit guide and telling me about how to do that. And you told me that at first the answers that I would get within very simple what they are. Hey, perhaps obvious, but understand that this is a reinforcement of the beliefs that you now have, not a beratement of them. And again, as electricity communications take place through the path of least resistance, as you allow the energy through, you will begin to expand your definition of what that path of least resistance is. And in fact, we'll begin if you are willing to not judge what you are getting to receive things which seem to be a bit different from your usual approach, but usually not at first. Well, the things that I am getting, I am not even sure they are like yes and no answers. Can come that way. Depends on what you said. Would you like to have more of a direct dialogue and discussion? Yes. All right. Then ask questions which will require more of an answer than yes or no and begin to trust those answers just as well. It is that sick. Well, I was hoping that maybe you could tell me that whether or not some of these things that were coming from were really true and they weren't just me making them out. Well, the idea is that all truths are true. We will be, shall we say, glad to facilitate and act as a mirror to allow you to know whether we buy into them, but no matter what it is you will share is true to somebody. So do share. What do you mean? What do you think you wish to verify? Oh, all right. For instance, I asked about coming here tonight. Face. And the voice was that I shouldn't come. Sure or should. I should not. Oh, why did you? I don't know. That's true. Oh, why not? Therefore, you have learned an important lesson. That's that. That any information that you receive is simply an option, simply increases the size of the menu from which you get to order. Never will an entity that you are communicating with live your life for you. They will simply communicate certain ideas for certain reasons, but it will always be up to you to make your own decisions and choices. In this particular instance, the service that was rendered to you from your guide was saying not to knowing that you wanted to, to see whether you would simply blindly follow information or bounce it off of who you are and make your own decisions. Congratulations. Oh, that's nice to know. You're allowed to have fun and play around. You don't have to be so serious about that. All right. Thank you. Thank you. No, I have one more question. Do you want to say something? I'm going to do a book store and I bought a book on UFO. Oh, right. And it's not the first one that I've looked at, but this was the first one I actually bought. And I took, I got it home because it was recommended in the bookstore. And I got it home and I started reading it and I read like two pages and I put it down because the material that I was reading was really scary. Oh, right. Well, it was, I can't, I can't give you the exact detail of it, but it was like things that I felt like that the person, what they were describing was like demons following them and it was so scary. Now understand, individuals who interact with extraterrestrials have the right, have the option always to exhibit their own autonomous point of view. Now what this means is that perhaps you can say for an analogy, the interactions, the events, the extraterrestrial contact is a neutral event. They will always have their option to interpret it in a particular way. Assume a particular attitude and then take actions based on those assumptions and interpretations. Therefore, if their initial premise is that they feel helpless, they do not feel that they create their own reality, they will generally create an interpretation that says it is happening to them, that it is happening, shall we say, not by their will. So therefore, is it no wonder that if they have that interpretation and attitude, that their action is to express fearfulness and negativity. This is what is occurring. From our perspective, the interactions themselves are literally neutral. You are dealing with a society in many of the instances that you label abductions, that we call detainments, that are literally quite neutral. One of the things they are exploring and are fascinating by in your society is the idea of emotionality. So they may seem rather like in that sense. So because they are blank, so to speak, they are beginning now to explore emotionality. They are very literally a mirror for whoever deals with them, a very clear mirror. So whatever the individual brings into the interaction is mirrored back. And if fear and helplessness is what they bring into the interaction, then what they feel is being overwhelmed and attacked. And they may very often then judge the beings who are doing the interacting to be demonic. Does that make sense? Yes, I kind of thought that was what it was, but I wanted to check that out. I didn't know that about the mirror or in part, but... Well again, because they are so blank, so to speak, they will reflect back what it is an individual brings into the interaction. So if they bring in bold willingness to act as an ambassador for your civilization, to do their civilization understanding that that's exactly what you are on. If you act like that, you get treated in a sense like that. They then mirror back to you the respect that you afford yourself. All right. They only know how to treat individuals so to speak by how they treat themselves. They assume individuals treat themselves the way they wish to be treated. They have much to learn. What were they? Well we are speaking of a particular and relating to what you are sharing as a civilization. That in a sense you can say so to speak originates from a star system named Zeta Ridiculum. They are the ones most commonly pictured in your literature as having the very wide upturned blackish eyes and very grayish in small features, large head. And why are those people in particular not part of that? The interplanetary association? Well in a sense you can understand that they are members but perhaps you can say not full fledged and this is because in a sense you can understand that they are still not shall we say leading their interactions with you in an open way where it is conscious and open. It is by agreement nothing is truly being breached but shall we say it is the preferential approach of the association to do so openly and this is beginning to transform. Alright thank you very much. As we. Back there. Thank you. Hi Lauren. Greetings. I am so interested here. Oh how? I had a very very powerful experience that I hope you can expand the heart. Oh not you too. Yeah and I feel about sharing it. Alright then simply go at your own head. Okay. I went to see a woman today first by teke healing and I went to her house before you proceed. What is it that you perceive needed to be needed? Is it physical? No. I wanted to forgive something. Oh my. I wanted to forgive my mother actually my biological mother and I went to see her she sat down and she started me in a chair and we sort of need to need and we shared to each other's eyes attempting to see each connect soul and I had a profound experience where her face with my eyes open connecting her eyes. We came to her eyes. You face melted away. Her body melted away. I saw many faces. Many people. In a sense you peered into the essence of her soul and saw beyond or through so to speak physicality. I saw her as an Indian woman. I saw me with her in a fire doing a religious ceremony. And I saw many things with my eyes open. I've never seen this before. It was almost as if my human vision was able to let go. You have expanded and will continue to do so. I saw many aspects of the earth. Her intent was to ground and to know my true mother's ears on the planet. She was telling me that my mother my biological mother was not my real mother. In a sense you didn't choose to interact with that individual and can use that creation as well but do proceed. What I saw I saw so much melting going on. It was almost as if I was in another dimension watching the aspects and her turn into fire and wind. You literally were by the way peering in that sense into other dimensions. I connected with an aspect of myself that felt more powerful than I've ever experienced myself to feel. You are simply remembering what you've never lost. Can you expand a little more on what happens during this experience? Well, very shall we say literally you recapitulated several lives that directly connected to that individual. So therefore you in a sense reestablished a connection understanding and running through some of the history that you have created to allow you to now come together in this life and begins you shall we say very quickly move through many issues that may have taken a bit of time in the other lives. So therefore in a sense it wasn't updating. What was the symbology of all the animal assessment changes for me? I saw her turn into many different animals. I felt that I was many different animals. Well again we will allow you to go through the interpretations of each particular animal and what this will overall extend to is the connection with earth, with nature itself. And understanding that you are not existing as a naked animal within a reality. You are projecting a reality. The natural elements of that reality are part and parcel of you as well. And it was in that sense an elaborate part of what you have labeled agrounding. I am interested in assisting this ground process for me. Do you have any suggestions? It's very simple. Act on what excites you the most. For it is the action. It is the taking of the ideas and mid-wiping them into physicality. That is literally what grounding is all about. Whatever way you can in any given moment, act, do. If you have an idea, physicalize it, utilize it, make it, shall we say, present itself into your reality. So simply when you determine what it is that excites you with integrity, begins to act and create a momentum of action, of your willingness to boldly go forth without hesitation. And that will literally ground you literally. And allow you at the same time to expand so though your feet may be on the ground, your head may be in the clouds. Watch out for some of those hidden UFOs. Can you have a name that you can share with me of the aspect of me from the play of these levels? One moment. What we are receiving, and again this is an approximation, would be Sonia. S-A-N-Y-A. How does that feel? Oh, and who is Libby? It is a direct reference to the same energy. Thank you. Anna? Anna? Yes. Oh, thank you. Hi. I just want to say thank you to you or I don't know what's pending to myself for being able to get here on time. Because I was really racing down the highway because I didn't want to be late. So important for me to be here on time. Oh, why? I thought, well, talk to them. Listen to them, you know. And I listened and I heard slow down a lot. But I still got here on time, so that was nice. Well, we thank you. Yes, thanks. I was interested in the meaning of this group. Can you share anything with the group of people that are here tonight? In a sense, you may understand that you are a wife, the Johnny Apple seeds of self-empowerment. For as you and that says are willing to begin to take back your own life and live it according to preference, you spread the seed out to the rest of the society that allows them to take root and allows. And shall we say an exponential fashion for the momentum of self-empowerment to grow and grow within the mass consciousness. As this occurs, it becomes that much easier for each individual involved in that mass consciousness should they choose to look at that reality to begin to actively engage themselves in that already existing frequency. So therefore, you may say you are the top layers. That's theirs, right? But also the top layers as well, not only in interacting extra-terrestrally but intra-terrestrally with others in your society. By being willing to boldly express who you are with integrity, you give an example to others of what is possible in a positive way. And this is being an ambassador to your own civilization. As the momentum increases within the entire civilization, that in a sense that aids in assists in bacheloretically us to interact with you, for simply we will only be able to do so when you will hold us as equals. So by being willing to take back your own power and treat other individuals in your immediate proximity as equals, this is showing very, shall we say actively to the universe that you are willing to begin to equalize all consciousness. Great. Yeah, because I was excited to see a lot of people that I haven't met before through you, through these encounters. You will always have many connections that have nothing to do directly with me. Very many shall we say tap live connections. And again, almost invariably individuals that attract themselves in these interactions have had one or many lives upon Atlantis. And this is shall we say perhaps one of the last times where in group many of these ideas were discussed in an acceptable way, whereas your society progressed in its directions of separation and limitation. It became far less acceptable to discuss these notions in public. It is now the timing of transformation whereby one of the symptoms of that timing is the ability to begin to come out of the closet and begin to have these conversations without hesitation again boldly without again fearing reprisals from your society. Very exciting. Great. It's only taken 25,000 years. Yeah. For me, I've been finding myself sharing this with other people and some, you know, some don't like it. But understand that if they see what you are saying within your actions that you are an example of an expression of what you are saying, there will be far fewer people who will choose not to like it. For the ones who choose not to like it in general have the perspective that it sounds like but get real. Yeah. So therefore as you are an expression that it not only is possible but here's the proof, you will find more of a percentage of individuals coming to you and asking you what's up, buddy. We want in. Yeah. Yeah, I feel that way. Oh, my. Okay. Okay. Well, absolutely. There are many ideas along these lines. Well, I'd like to be specific then. Oh, help me. My brakes. My brakes work. My brakes work, but they're in bad shape. So am I stopping or am I like out of control or perhaps you are telling yourself in symbolic terms that you need not be so hesitant once you get the message. However, we suggest fixing the brakes. But I was thinking about tonight, like, what does this mean? You are more willing in the sense to force yourself to simply go forward without putting in the stoppers. So to speak. Right. So I am moving forward. So it's a positive thing for me. Well, it's a neutral symbol. Which do you choose to interpret it as? It's up to you. But both interpretations are valid. We simply present the one that will empower you. Should you choose to use it? Yeah, I'm choosing to use it as there's no stopping me. Oh, that was positive. Like I'm really, I feel good. You know, about stuff. So. Oh. As you say, you have our full permission to put a white in the pedal to the metal. Um. That means a red thing language. Yeah, it is. I guess I can use that in the future for my car. Oh, we can. I understand from time to time you may also shift your perspective. Okay. Yeah. It's been a lot of time. It's important to me. I do a lot of things. Oh. Um, I'd like to move on to the next subject. It's about American Indians. And I'm interested lately in coming to me a lot. You know, the energy has been coming to me a lot. The voice, what's it say. And I'm interested in any, um, you shared a little bit with me in a private session about a past life with my friend Lydia about to end civil war times. And we're both interested in the fact about what that past life was. And I, it dawned on us perhaps we were Indians. You know, even though the time is kind of off. We will think that you are approaching the overall idea but not expand too much upon it for you will find it a fun ride. Yeah. I know because it seems like it's linked to some information that we could use now. Well, that is the bottom line. You realize it to whatever way that it allows you to apply it into this life. There is truly no necessity for you to have bleed through from other lives. You can truly in any given situation with any given set of circumstances. Simply assume this is the only life. Therefore, allow me to use explanations from this life to justify and explain these things. However, it can be interesting information. It can allow you to tap into other experiences that you have had but is only as useful as it is applicable. Otherwise, it is simply mental. Nice information. Hey. Okay. Yeah, because that kind of stops me on where I was going with a question. I just been feeling it a lot and dreaming a lot about it. I mean, maybe some call visions. Then you are on that past most from me. So simply, if you have questions, ask them before you fall asleep. Ask them before you own meditations. If you wish to tune into that, do it directly. You will find from our particular position, we will somewhat pull back on the elucidations of these ideas to allow individuals to remain grounded in this life. So you advise that it's... If it excites you, we'll begin to... We will, however, give you the notion of the soup. Try. Okay. The Agonklin... Or not the Agonklin, but the Agonklin. Agalo. By any chance. That's your... Could you help me with a name? No, quickly. No. A lot. One moment. Did there anything else? Um... Yes. I'll now be done. Um... I just real quickly, I had a dream last night during the thunderstorm. Um... it was moving to me, and I'm not sure how to interpret it, except the fact that I sensed you there, you know, someone, but I was... it was a very active dream. I ended up in a helicopter. I was near the door, open door in a helicopter, and we were heading for a gateway, you know, threshold, some sort, but we crashed. But I jumped out, and I kind of hurled myself in. I never hit bottom, and usually I would expect to wake up at that point, but I didn't. I just hurled myself through a kind of a diffused light, and my G-metro figure, which came up earlier, which really struck me. And... Yeah. And then I woke, and I woke in a house, and I met all my friends there, and we were all real happy. My former wife was there, and we were all real happy. And we all were so happy because we were meeting each other in the next life. May I make a suggestion? You did walk through that gate simply not in the way you expected. In the dream? Or lately? In your life, but again, in the dream as an analogy. Yes. Okay. We thank you. Good night. Yeah, no, I thank you. Um, hello. I... But my problem seems to be... Your what? And I have no problem. I am... Now, I am not a bad professional. A problem? That is no problem at all. Well, I seem to be on the verge of being very free, and selling houses, starting home in life, and my situation is that I... Whenever I get an idea, of first book to create our reality, then I have lots of ideas of what's at my possible place of living, and work would be. And then when I get one idea, then another comes in, and every idea cancels itself, and I'm left with... almost being forced to have a blank mind, and letting an opportunity, whatever, to present itself. Well, in a sense, you are forcing yourself to remain grounded, but grounded into the moment. Without rigidly defining that your reality must happen, and it must happen in this particular way. That is what creates the disapointing. So, therefore, again, you can use this by simply being willing to let the situation be obvious. Within that moment, have the intention that you have, and allow, not force, not make, but allow, by doing whatever you can in any given moment toward that end, but if there is nothing you can do, engaging in what is available. Though that seems like a side track, it actually accelerates the process. It seems like the flag is not to create my future. I mean, I want to start my work, and yet... Start as though this is the only time there is. Then everything else will simply fall into place, and you will perhaps attract, from the doing of who you are, the individuals you are seeking, rather than directly through the, shall we say, channel that you have created as your real estate person. Do you understand? No, not really. You are still on the fence. No. That is what we're saying. I am assuming that I have totally released to have my business to start my business, and the house isn't there anymore. I don't want to start a business in a place where I might not be living. Why? You are holding yourself up. If you knew that in six months your house would be sold, would you not have that business for the six months, and when the house was sold, move the business? That's what I could decide to do. Then simply take for granted, without originally assigning that it must be two, three, four, six months, and do that. Allow yourself to let yourself loose, so to speak. Do not hold yourself back. Then all the elements and details that will allow you to let yourself loose from this particular symbol will arrive. But by holding yourself back, you do not create the conducive frequency to let shall we say the other loose. That's the biggest problem I have right now. It is again another version of sitting on the fence, rather than moving definitely, purposefully in the direction you choose. Trusting that your excitement is not only an indication of who you are, but the timing of your excitement is also an indication. So if you are excited right now to start it, trust it, and do not fixate upon the details. Very often you will find when you let go of the details, when you do quote unquote, sell the house and determine to make the move, certain things will position themselves to assist you to make the move itself if that is what you are hesitant about most effortless. Hold that, it makes sense. Thank you. As you. Hello. Hello. Thank you very much. I have a few questions by proxy from Trevor in Australia, here at Harmony. Trevor, Trevor, I think the source might have been this hashtag command that there would be in July five days in the darkness. Something to the fact that the sun would not rise, et cetera. Could you give us an assessment on this? From our perspective, it is simply one interpretation of a particular gateway that individuals as a whole will pass through. It not necessarily need be taken literally. I see. Is it getting a negative and a negative and a negative of something which can be quite accelerating and positive. Right. Right. Well, thank you for that. Understand that the nature of the way your planet exists would not allow the sun to quote unquote not come up and understand that if the sun was not up in one hemisphere by definition, it is up in the other. Well, that's fine. Now, what about a positive entity experiencing the phenomenon that others interpret negatively? What was the positive entity experience? In which situation? When can probably with this particular gateway? Well, for instance, utilizing the example that you have chosen. Individual may experience for a period of time in around that time frame a complete desire to turn within to an offense close their eyes in a sense blocking out the light of your world, but turning within to reflect inwardly and not utilizing the external for validation. That would be one exactly. Thank you very much. The Trevor asks the concept of intergalactic federation. Is that the same as the association of worlds? In a sense for all intents and purposes. Yes. Okay. Now, do you understand that of the many societies that channel and interact and communicate with your planet, your civilization, again, there is always shall we say the limitation of the interpretation via some divatitudes and the actions of the channels. So therefore, in general, the information that purports to come from extraterrestrial sources that is being, shall we say, presented as negative is being interpreted, assumed to be negative and then presented as negative, but it is an interpretation, perhaps a misrepresentation in most cases. Thank you very much. Then with regard to the Stan Meyer water fuel cell technology that has been developed in Ohio, what's your current destiny at this particular project? There is a high degree of momentum behind the project coming, shall we say, to fruition. There is also shall we say an indecisiveness due to various influences on that individual. So shall we say it has not yet been decided, but there is a likelihood behind it. Right. Then lastly, Trevor suggests that the new meditation with regard to peace may not be a convenient time, new may not be convenient for a great many people. Well, we always, whenever sharing any tool with your society, preface by saying that your imagination will tailor it, will change it, will shall we say fit it to you. So therefore, he can take the symbol that has been provided, your peace clock idea, and simply modify it in whatever way. If it is being done on a regular basis, the momentum will occur. Right. Right. Well, he suggested why not any hour? It can be. It can be. Okay. My suggestion of the one particular time would simply to create a wave-like sweeping motion around your planet at the time zones change, but this does not mean that other individuals cannot create other eddy and flows and currents within that wave. Right. All right. My suggestion would be, well, to my imagination, is that it means 11-11. Why not? It's because it's a good night out. Well, also understand in some sense, you can say that no matter what time it is, it's noon somewhere. That's true. So you can use your imagination in an expansive way as you wish. Exactly. So at any given time, during the day, you can simply imagine yourself to be at some place where it's noon, depending on your meditation. And perhaps also realize that it will be more beneficial to do and perform and participate in that to simply not do it all together because noon is not a convenient time. Yes. So whatever your imagination tells you, whatever version you are offered, if it excites you, do that. Great. That is finally, I'd just like to say that my decision... It is more the consistency than the precise time. Right. Thank you. And then finally, I'd like to say my spaceship is out there and flying is out of repairs. Hey. Last time I spoke. And... Code of Blacks. If name is the Lucky Star. You changed it. I did. Oh. Well, I'm always changed. So it was the name of my ship. But less to the last time. Oh. Will that do? Yes, it's nice and loud. And we thank you as well for your ongoing willingness to creatively share with us. Shh. Alon. Say that. Hello, Alon. Great. Thank you for coming. And thank you as well. If each of us is all it is to ourselves and everything already exists, when we create our reality, we take from the potential, infinite potential reality and the probable futures and create our experience by our assignment of meanings and our definition. And you often say that as we're doing this, the universe hears us and the universe supports our desires. It's moment, shall we say, directly your actions. Yes, I know. Again, the interpretation and the assumptions and the attitudes are one way down the groundwork for the actions, so they are directly involved. But again, actions literally do speak louder than words or thoughts to the universe. My question is, who is the universe? Is the universe all it is? All that is. And your version of all that is? Oh, that is. At the same time, all that is is each and every manifestation with image mortality of all that is. At the same time, it is self-aware. And you can understand that you are an expression of all that is. Therefore, most obviously, if you exhibit self-awareness, so must all that is. The difference is that it does not limit itself to being self-aware only. It is also expansively aware, infinitely aware. Okay. Thank you. And before I came, I heard a program on TV about Ross Frow. And a lot of his concepts struck me as very interesting in lieu of the discussions that we've had about the political directions on this globe. And one of his strong points was for us to take responsibility for ourselves and that he wants direct input from the people and to work with the people. And he sounded terrific. Is this guy for real? Well, again, it is your plot. We do not endorse candidates. But the idea is that we suggest that you, as you have in our beginning to look at the issues rather than the glitch. Yeah, he doesn't like the glitch. Therefore, if the issues ring true with you, then that is what will give you the indication that that works for you. It is just, again, one tool. If it works for you, use it. If not, another tool will come along. But we do suggest being that this is an extensional representation of yourself as a person upon your planet, that you do exercise some care if this is of concern to you in looking at these issues and making the decisions that is most representative of who you are. This is the action that you can take to make the change. Okay. I also saw... Literally, you're all for real. Yeah. And you're all white characters. Ha ha ha. I also saw a program about whales. And they were very concerned with the pollution on this planet starting to threaten the whales being. Is this happening? Two something, yeah. Can the whales do anything to help themselves not be subjected to this? Or is it a message to us to get our act together and stop hurting them? Yes, as you may say, it is a message to you to begin to view your interactions with nature, your interactions with your planet and others in an integrated fashion. Is them beating themselves the same thing? That can be, shall we say, one of the reasons? Very often, there will be a confusion in what you sometimes label the electromagnetic flow lines of your planet, which can result in shall we say some erroneous navigation. I have one other question. Does a tree... Is a tree a film universe? What is it? Okay, thanks. We thank you, Esma. Oh, it's over there. I have an excitement which is working with children to do bodywork and channeling to them from them. Well, how would you... You are doing a just fine. Simply continue to enjoy yourself. Simply continue if you wish and it excites you the weaving of the tail as you are in that sense, working with and enhancing the energies. And do you... You have been a storyteller many times. Honestly, sorry. I want to invite the children who are excited to interact with me to stay in my story. Oh. She's not a fellow storyteller if they were. It would be their passion. I'll go through that. Oh, you're serious. I want to know a little bit more about you from this level of consciousness here. What are your interests? You have a family. And what is your relationship with you? Hey. First of all, my main interest in that sense right now is constantly fluctuating from moment to moment, but in general, is these styles of communication. I also interact with other civilizations as well, but this is one of my stronger connections right now. So therefore, that, in a sense, is one of my greatest excitements right now. I have, in, again, my past, partaking of what you label swimming. Simply for the enjoyment, simply for the interacting with some of the marine life, so to speak, on our planet, which is not exactly analogous to your dolphins, but more as your animals. I have also had interest in music, our version of music, that is. And to some degree, what you would label the arts, though more the manipulation of what you would label specific styles of laser light, more than the creation of dyes upon what you would label paper, which we do not exactly have. The relationship of myself to the one that we call for convention, Shira, is as an associate. Also involves similarly an extra esosani communication. So therefore, that is, shall we say, our common interests. She, in a sense, you may understand, does not have a reincarnational history upon our planet. So though she is in this particular life that she is living, and esosani, she has other connections altogether, which we will discuss at another time. This was what was untranslatable last time we had interacted. Well, that is. I have another question. I sense that I have not heard her name, Patrick. Can you help me with that? Our particular, again, interpretation is Shira. So I did hear her name accurately. Again, it is only a convention for your convenience. We have no names, that's such. So if you do not quite like it, you can change it. Do you have children? I felt personally. No. Well, you're a male. Do you have a mate? We understand. No, in the way that you mean. That is perhaps an option in my future. But I am very strongly connected with many children. For as you know, the parents upon our planet are the parents of all. So I interact rather consistently with children. And in that sense, have some excitement to have my own, in that sense. Although we do not look at it quite as possessively as perhaps you do. That is something that I envision participating in. Shira, man. Tomorrow. Hey. I have a question regarding both your Johnny Appleseed. Kind of your Johnny Appleseed idea connected with, in your book, or not your book, but the book of Bishar, the book for Change. It describes, in there it describes 1993 as being sort of a cut-off date. In a sense. Yes. Well, feeling as though maybe I'm a Johnny Appleseed kind of person here, it seems like I have short work time to get out. Oh, no, no, no. Simply what is meant loosely as a cut-off is that if you are not by that point in timing, engaged, either fully or mostly, in being willing to express who you are and not settle for less, generally individuals will begin to find where they have settled for less. These manifestations will simply fall apart more quickly. It will simply be almost impossible to maintain the things that you maintain that are not reflective of who you are. So if you are simply now beginning to look at your excitement, to act on your excitement, you are simply will accelerate through that in a positive way. Just as you will find it more difficult to sustain realities that are not reflective of who you are, it will be that much more simple to perpetuate the realities that do reflect who you are. Therefore, no time limit relax. Simply follow your excitement and that will not apply to you as strongly other than allowing the acceleration for you at that point. So, my preference would be to believe that more people get a hang of this that it will be easier for other people to get the hang of it. Sometimes this is called a hundred mucking. Which I like quite a lot. But there are then also, literally, physically more living examples. And this is as strong as we say. And impulse that will shall we say radiate throughout your society. And that is a very important thing to do with individuals placed though that they can be seen and acting in this way. As an example. In the last session that we had a private session with you, I asked if you said that it was sensitive, our momentum was actually quicker or things were moving along at an even a more accelerated pace than have been expressed by you previously. In reference to that then, as sort of a timeline, what would your estimation be of our time to have a possible encounter with you directly? Five to fifteen of your years at this point? Five to fifteen. Also, it is said in the book that you would not be the personalization we would connect with directly. Right. This is most likely. All right. Most likely that will be ridiculous. And what would be the timeline for that connection? Well again, some information will begin to leak out even within this year of your time. But perhaps face to face interactions will not seem to begin to again from five to fifteen of your years. Approximately. This can change. Okay. Also understand what others say. If you wish to view yourself as Johnny Apple sees himself empowerment, perhaps you can understand what you are, shall we say, spreading around our ecstasy. So how does this happen? Recently I had an opportunity to listen to a woman speak her name as Anita. What's her last name? Rotic. Rotic. From my point of view seems to represent someone who really is acting in an integrated way with her business and in the environment and has built a $800 million business and one of the wealthiest woman in England. And I don't know, are you aware of her from your perspective as being there? We are shall we say honing in on the particular energy and diversity. What's just her style of working with the indigenous populations in areas to empower them and if corporations putting money back into those areas for the empowerment of the groups of people living in communities. And her whole idea where you walk into one of her, they call it the body shot, you don't see signs of sales, you see things like global warming or rainforest or her ideas for what needs to happen on our earth. She's quite quite. Well that is a bold expression. Yes. She is willing in that sense to spread those things. Yes. Well that's all. You are beginning to attract to yourself reflections and understand that you can only perceive something if you first contain it. So therefore you are now getting external validations for what you already contained and conveniently building shall we say a new set of friends. Yeah I was surprised that this particular interaction I went to, I hardly ever run into anyone I know and I knew about a third of the people who showed up for this. Oh what a question. Yes it has seemed like quite a coincidence. Life vibration attracts life vibration. Therefore we thank you. I wanted to talk about the last few days of global understanding our cause, our astrologers I would say. On the other night on ABC News Nightline they were talking about the Big Bang Theory. Well the idea is that what you label the Big Bang is a localized effect. It is not the initial beginning of the entire of all creation. Understand that what you label physical space so to speak is infinite. Does not curve around on itself. If it did what would be on the outside of the curve. The idea is that it is infinite in all directions. Therefore the farthest that you can see and perceive is simply the farthest that you can see and perceive. What you perceive as the Big Bang is the intersection of consciousness with physicality. It creates a spark from which emanates shall we say reality, little physical reality. So therefore from our perspective yes it does occur. Yes you have shall we say been part of it or one of them. And anything that you can perceive is shall we say a product of that particular localized initiation spark. But it is not the only initiation spark. Now I am probably asking you to question that. Well I mean the thing is who created the Big Bang? Who created the universe? The multi dimensions. Even you can say that you did in a sense you can say that all that is. It depends on how you choose to look. It depends on what it is you are actually defining. Well actually basically the finding is. In a sense for the purposes of simple clarification. And again this is only an arbitrary explanation. It is only true within a certain framework. But understand you can figure it this way. All that is created you. You created your reality. Okay since all that is created you. So therefore in a sense you can label the Big Bang in a sense without analogy as a co-creation of yourself and the infinite. Right but okay. All that is created you and you created your reality. What I am going into is how did the whole. I mean basically before there was all that is. How did that happen? And there was no before all that is. Understand before during and after art simply designation. Timeline designation. All that is has always existed and will always exist. In fact all that is has existed before even within your time frame the idea you labeled purpose. Therefore all that is needs no purpose to continue to exist. You are speaking about an infinite concept with no beginning. No ending and comparing yourself which you create as having a beginning, middle, ceiling ending, leading to a new beginning. And therefore it is simply a comparison. It is really just because on earth terminology earth understanding we do with religions and so forth. And even non-religious people. Their concept of how we came about and your explanations were great. But there is still this question coming through to me that saying well this is all good and understood. But somewhere somehow I mean you say anything just was always here and it has always been like this. But somehow somebody or someone had to create something. Well you are now seeking about the designation that you call physical reality which contains the idea of a beginning which can be created. So physical reality has a beginning, middle and ending. It is the exploration of timing of a timeline. Therefore when you have a reality that contains the concept of a beginning then you can create into that reality. However non-physical overall infinite existence simply has a whole entire different set of shall we say parameters. And they are not bound by what you consider yourself to be. So you are in a sense mixing finite and infinite and attempting to understand infinite through finite senses which in a sense may seem unattainable at this point. So you can say yes there was a creation but it was the creation of physical reality. Before which all that is still always existed. But see I understand that all that is always existed. So therefore there is no way that all that is was created by anything else because it was always existing. Exactly. Again you are treading on the infinite so perhaps it feels like a pattern. You don't very much like that. But understand that when you feel that feeling of paradox you are right on the edge. And you are beginning to understand that. Again it does not have to be either this is true or that is true. No in between. You can understand this is true and that is true. And it goes to things seem mutually exclusive then it feels like a paradox. But from the overall shall we say category of existence it all always exists as no beginning, no middle, no ending, no time. No boundaries, no foreseeable shall we say. And? I understand. I have two more questions for you. Is that clear? Yes. I'm going to work. I'm going to actually I'm taking it all in. I'm basically going to give you some time to work on that. Okay. I understand it more to myself. But do understand again. One of the things that you are attempting to do is assign a purpose to all that is to make some sense perhaps you can say of all that is. But all that is simply is not bound by the idea of purpose. Purpose is a concept. Purpose was created meaning it had a beginning before that beginning all that is existed. And all that is simply needs no purpose to exist. Simply is. Simply exists. I understand. I understand what you are saying exactly. I'm just I'm taking it all in. Oh, my other two questions is recently there have been earthquakes in Los Angeles. And I was wondering also Mount Etna which has been pouring out lava. Our military seems to want to try to corke it up or plug it up like put a band-aid on it like a human certificate. If you get a cut you can human being put a band-aid on it. But you cannot put one on a ball paper. Exactly. And if you do shall we say it won't be there very well. So what's the sense I mean well basically in general all these things are occurring. But what's the sense of the military trying to prevent lava from coming out from the earth. You tell me. Most directly and obviously is that it is pouring upon their base. I think that's what I was thinking. Could you explain you talked about the acceleration of all these things that are occurring at a fast rate. And which I think most of us can feel that happening throughout you know I mean at least the people here and those that are associated with that are conducive to this. What do you see in terms of physical. I would say physical or actually well not say physical. Political contact of our government with openly with the extraterrestrial. Say they're going to make they're going to be soon in announcement. This year. Not necessarily of late announcement but the leakage of information seemingly by mistake. That will be the style. It just happens to seem to come off someone got a hold of it. It will seem in that sense to not be responsibly decisively disseminated at first. This will enable people again by their estimation to begin to ease into the idea and acculate to it. That is at least the feeling. This my understanding from someone I spoke to that during this a pulsation of lights that will occur. There's not a timing set for it but this will be seen by many people on the planet. You wear this. You're not by the reference you are sharing. Perhaps if you re-establish contact with that idea and re-present it, it will be something that is familiar to us. But immediately we are not shall we say tuning in on it. When I'm a personal thing I don't even know if I've talked about this before. Somehow I think I have. It's about someone in my family who has something that was passed down from generation to generation after something I'm supposed to seek out. Something called a scepter. It's supposed to be some sort of engravings on the scepter or something about a scepter. I'm already taking the initiative myself to contact the parts of my family who might have some knowledge of this. We have no knowledge of that. Now this does not mean it does not exist simply that it is apparently not relevant to us. Thank you very much. Thank you. Elon. Hey. Following up on Kenny's question. Oh, right. You stated the following. The physical universe in fact did have the beginning, a middle, and an end. When did it begin? Your particular universe? The what we know is the physical universe, yes. One more. Approximately 4.5 to 6 billion of the ordinary. And this planet is a particular localized effect. Your particular solar system is approximately 4.5 billion years. This planet has a habitable planet. Approximately. Approximately. Approximately. Six to 12 million of the ordinary. Approximately. I see. There is some difficulty in translating these businesses in time. Six hundred million years. No. Six to 12 million. Six to 12 million. Hey. Approximately 6 million of your years ago would be the appearance of what you label mankind. Though this is shall we say quite a bit before when you're scientists supposed to. Before that there was habitable by the light. Anytime the source in the light. How long has it supported any kind of light? Again approximately. Again approximately 6 million additional years to that. I see. Okay. Again there is some difficulty in the translation that we'll do with an analogy. There are fundamentalist Christian groups that hold the idea that the world was created by God in seven days within the last 10,000 years. But from our perspective that is simply a shall we say misunderstood analogy. And again simply an interpretation of a particular style of timing that would not necessarily be days. Would you comment on why the idea that God created the world within the last 10,000 years is so dear to them, so important to them? Simply it supports their notions and what they are presenting as their religious ideas. And if they make a statement such as that it is to their best interest that it not be disproved, or they sometimes feel that that will supplant their credibility. I see. Okay so it has more psychological value to them than any type of symbolic import. Hey. Now all of those. Are we keeping this individual? Yeah. We will communicate with you on other lines. Yeah. Nothing is lost. Just a statement. I assume that all of us who are here in the physical universe at this time have, and actually simultaneously do manifest in all the non-physical dimensions as well. Is that not correct? It is correct, but again more perhaps from the perspective of your over-solved part of the definition of this perspective. It is to not be aware of that, but since it is true overall from the perspective of your over-solved to some degree you can tap into that. We have discussed this. Will we present at the non-beginning? Define. Well, you said all that is has no beginning and actually precedes purpose. All right. Understand this. Yes. You are also infinite and eternal. Yes. So we were present at conscious beings at the non-beginning. It's in a sense, utilizing that terminology. So it does follow then that existence is really non-logical. It is both logical and non-logical. But by logic you cannot. The logic says there has to be a beginning to everything. That is one particular style of logic, a logic that shall we say subscribes to an infinite nature is another style of logic. I see this. So there's non-linear logic. It is our brain, our nervous system, wires such that it can entertain these concepts effectively to some degree, to some degree. There are certain limitations but they are not imposed upon you. You choose in that sense to abide by them to explore by the rules you have set. In the meditative stage are we more capable of entertaining these types of non-linear logic? Can we, individuals seem to be able to stare off into space with their eyes open as well? But in bringing it back and communicating it, there would be a language problem, yes? Maybe, depending upon shall we say your lack of your vocabulary. It is not our language itself linguistically and our mathematics ties to linear logic. There will generally be certain points that you will hang up on because again they are infinite points being perceived or compared to finite standards. However, as one approximates these non-linear logic phenomena, is it not true that it would facilitate or does facilitate our moving into dimensions of greater freedom? In a sense but that is automatic, you will grow and progress in a sense in that direction on an adequate. Is that clear? That's clear. There will be time for but a few more sharing. Male. In the court. I would read this book about Atlantis. And in it they state the probability that the deluge was actually the thinking of Atlantis. Is that true? There is some overlapping of these ideas. That is all we will share. I will read more pages of the book though. We assume that the book explains to you when you will enjoy it. Oh yeah it does. Because it was written, the records were taken from the Library of Congress at the late 1800s. Is there a show on the map? Right now. This is Bisharrau. Loosely speaking, yes. Oh my god. Message sent. All right. Yes, just a foot though. On names of ships. When I first became aware of the real power of the imagination, I started to create a spaceship. The imagination. And that name, remembering the power of imagination. Now that is why we asked about the change. Yes. Now that I understand that unending ecstasy is my birthright, I chose a different name. One that, one the lucky star. Oh thank you. One that in our understanding is a very fortunate person born under a lucky star is very fortunate indeed. Oh what if you say this? Yeah. That is why they are. Well they say so. The lucky star is a lot of fun on the lucky star. The party ship. Oh all of them. We have some wild times. Perhaps we will join you but refrain from the dawning of life-shade. Well that's all right. The project by the way that the name of my final final ship is the all the ones. Oh wow. Very expensive. Very inclusive. We have to. Thank you. You're on? A lot. Then may I. Thank you. Um, you are looking at the goal of the beneficials to integrate fears or would it be the beneficials to integrate the fears before? Our suggestion that you look and integrate whatever fears come up while rather before interacting directly with the symbol. And understand that even when you do very often the symbol will bring up the ones that you did not look at. Therefore if you do a little bit of housekeeping you may find less of that style of fear. But understand that you can use that. You cannot create a reality greater than you can handle. And along with it will be much integrated information. And to you. Mike. Yeah, just something I forgot to ask earlier. I've seen spots and I picked this up from another tape, an earlier tape, that it has to do with some sort of transformation. Can you help me with that? This is Ryan in the spot. Well, I'm calling them hangers. They're like they've started around New Year's and of course my, you know, my fear is that I've got them getting some sort of, you know, vision problem. But I really trust that I am going through a process and I think these spots they're small and they come into my peripheral vision more so. In a sense you can understand that you are simply seeing what is there, though perhaps not shall we say what you usually consider to be physically there. In other words, you are expanding your vision similarly as I've been discussed earlier with another individual in such a way. And allowing shall we say the inclusion of this expansion but only a little bit at a time. Only at first in the periphery. Understand that it is shall we say beque to you at your own pace and will simply represent again your willingness to begin to look beyond what is simply right physically there. So, they last a long time. Perhaps you'll find them to transform altogether but this does not mean in a sense that the energy is no longer there. Simply that you are now used to it and do not feel the difference. But you will find the ability, if you wish to, to begin to see, into, peer into other realities to some degree. Oh, okay. So, is that all? I think so. I think I'm clear on that. Oh, thanks. Back there. We're all here. We come here for insight, I guess, and for information from you. And you, there's one premise that, you know, we are the Johnny Applesies that our society is going through a very dynamic time. However, when the question was asked about Ross Perot, you, you kind of intimated that you were apolitical and had to be our interpretation. I haven't discussed politics with people in this room, but I have a sense that we have many of the same concerns about our society and the universe. I guess what my question is, is why won't you give us guidance as to who we should follow in the sense that you said you mentioned the word glitz. But politics in this country is for the most part glitz between the public relations people and the advertising people that the man on the street really doesn't know the candidates because by the time they come out, they are so discolored by all the mechanizations of the media that we really don't know our reality. But your media affords you the ability to be able to get in touch with those individuals, to in a sense follow them, to in a sense glean what their perspectives are. I in this particular life have not chosen, so to speak, to be upon your planet. And therefore it is not my place to comment about the specifics or give opinions in that sense about individuals, in that sense we truly have no opinions in the way that you mean anyway. So simply we do not have in that sense an opinion about it. But we do suggest that if you look at what the issues are that are of concern to you as an individual that you can attract yourself with the way your media is set up, even with the fact that it is glitz oriented, the issues, the issues do shine through, you can find them, establishing what issues are important to you and then allowing yourself to establish which candidate as you say. Now, expresses or reflects those particular conditions is a very individual, very personal thing, and we would not assume in that way to interfere with that process, but simply again suggest clarifying your vision and intention. And then understanding that because people's intentions and visions are different, they will gravitate toward different individuals, different candidates. One is not better than the other. One in that sense is not stronger or greater than the other. They feel different needs. So therefore all the individuals present have these different needs and will need to make these determinations individual. Does that make sense? Thank you. All right. One more question over there to be next. Thank you. I experience allergy to pollen, dust, leaf molds to certain foods. And I'm wondering, and I know other people do too, and I'm wondering, it occurs to me that there's a cause. I'm taking care of this medically. I'm wondering if you can help me understand that. Allow us to simply point out the particular symbology and do what you will with it. Understand that you are not within a reality. You are the reality. The reality is in fact an expression and extension of youth. So therefore in that particular notion you are creating the symbol that something in your reality does not belong and in fact can inflict harm upon you. So therefore look at where you do not view your reality as yourself. Look at where you place the lines where the separations are and also look at why you would have anything externally that would seem to attack you and put you on a defense. We strain in this ideological direction for it will perhaps have a more fruitful outcome than your medical approach. Thank you very much. And to me. Please go ahead. You can say much about your reality. Nobody here? No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Does it tie into the acceleration, the energy acceleration? It's too some degree. It also has, again, too some degree to do with certain individuals. Interpreting that inevitable changes, changes there will be, must occur in a particular negative way. Now understand that considering the intensity of what occurred, there was, shall we say, what damage then perhaps you would expect. So it has been, shall we say, defused to some degree. But understand that there are still many individuals particularly in those areas who literally feel that they need to be shaken awake. Therefore, if individuals will be willing to be willing to simply awaken themselves, they will not need to create an external symbol. But again, rather than there being one large manifestation, there seems to be the diffusion of several slightly smaller ones. So there is still the siphoning, the sieve in going on. Also many individuals that do an experience, that pretty positive experience is considering. Even one in the midst of it, and again it allows other individuals, such as yourselves, to be aware of what you might call negative events or experience with other individuals, not needing to experience it yourself. And you may see some more of this again as you expand your awareness, become more aware of the positive and the negative. The form that the awareness of the negativity will take is being aware of it happening to other individuals. At this time, allow me to express my unconditional love and appreciation for the blessings that each and every one of you bring to this interaction. For you very literally are each a blessed gift, a blessed spark and extension of all that is. And we benefit and expand and grow by interacting with the blessing that you give. Therefore, understand that you sometimes do, disguise your blessing, and when they come along, simply say, alright, alright, alright, this seems negative, very negative. I am the passive interpreter, this is negative, and undoubtedly gotten a negative response. Surprise, surprise. Now I will look at it not only as neutral, not only as positive, but as a blessing. In fact, I could not have grown in the way I say I wish to if this did not happen, so what does it allow me to do? What does it bar me from doing? What does it stop me from doing? What does it actually either force you to do that you would not have done, or what does it now allow you to do that was not available before? This is how you can count rather than forsake your blessing. We thank you, and bid you a most fondant mother. What do you think?
