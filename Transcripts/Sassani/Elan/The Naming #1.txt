 For the whole of the evening of your time as you create time to exist. Great honor to all of us. Thank you very much. We begin this interaction, this evening of your time, with the entitlement, the naming. Allow us before we begin to speak for a moment about one particular idea. Although, and we have discussed this before with members of your design, you are all 100% conscious mess. One of the expressions of that 100% totality in your particular society is the idea of breaking down seemingly artificially your consciousness into what you consider to be segments. For the purposes of this brief discussion, we will mostly be involved with the idea you label conscious and unconscious. There are other names of conscious and various, shall we say, different definitions for what these all mean, but for the purposes of this discussion. We are simply referring to conscious awareness that what you believe is on the surface, so to speak, of your consciousness and unconscious awareness, which is what you deem to be, shall we say separate from your surface consciousness from the typical you, you define yourself to me, but yet you feel it's still in there in that sense. First of all, understand that it is quite simple to take information, shall we say, that you have, so to speak, stored in the unconscious and naked conscious. The idea is once it is focused upon by your conscious awareness, it is by definition now a conscious idea. First, however, let us proceed with the following definition, one that we have shared before. Unconscious knowingness. Unconscious knowingness is from our perspective the same as conscious unknowingness. Now what this means, as though you consider on the one hand that unconscious knowingness is information to which you do not directly have access, the idea is a balanced equation is that you may also consider to be conscious on knowingness. And what this means is that you are choosing at this time to not know a particular idea on the surface. Now the purpose for the redefinition is that that now plugged into the formula that you are exercising choice. And this means you can always now begin to make other choices. One shall we say, semantic definition places it out of your grasp. The other being conscious unknowingness and therefore a choice gives you the opportunity again to begin to allow what needs to, when it needs to, to become conscious. Now we have spoke about again this many times and there are many ways with which you can begin to allow yourself to integrate your unconsciousness to your consciousness, thereby being a living, working if you will, playing expression of one whole consciousness. And the simple idea is as follows. When something occurs in your life that you simply feel at that moment perhaps from your old perspective does not belong. When you label it, extraneous. Everything fits in my life but this does not belong here. That is your strongest opportunity, that particular idea to take something which is quote unquote unconscious and make it conscious. Not by defining it as extraneous because when you do, you do not give yourself the opportunity or the eye so to speak to see why you created it. Very often or most often shall we say, the things in your life which are unpreparential and seen extraneous are the products of your unconscious creatorhood for as we have also shared. You always create your own reality 100% but you do so consciously and unconsciously. What this is leading to is the things that very often individuals will say, well I could almost believe that I create my own reality except I would never create that. The fact thing is what we are speaking of as an opportunity for perhaps you did not create that consciously but created you did. And you are labeling it as extraneous can now draw your attention to the fact that that particular idea is an opportunity to transform it from the unconscious to the conscious. Therefore take for granted if you wish you do not have to. That everything that you have formally labeled extraneous has a reason and when you will simply take this for granted you will then give yourself every some shall we say vision some type of eye to begin to at least look at what that might be. Whenever you see something that on the surface you immediately label negative and not belonging that particular idea is a prime opportunity for you to begin to realize that because you have created it you have done so for a reason and begin to look what that reason may be. Very often it will simply be an opportunity to define within yourself what you must still believe in order to have created and those beliefs that will result in an unpreparantial creation are in general unconsciously formulated and in general not the beliefs that will be made. That will enable you to create your life according to preference in other words they are limiting beliefs. When you take a belief that you have held unconsciously and make it conscious that is owning a belief. This is what always allows you to change any belief first owning it and it is the ones that you wish you did not have. That are the ones that when you own them and change them will make the biggest difference in your life. Therefore all your liabilities as you say can now be viewed as your greatest assets. By simply utilizing them in any way shape or form that allows you to glean anything that is positive about them. That is taking unconscious and allowing it to be conscious. Once you own that belief you can still keep it nothing is lost nothing is taken from you but you at least then have the option consciously to decide whether you prefer to keep it or whether you prefer to transform it to something that will then perhaps allow you to do the things you say you wish to do. Now say this time into shall we say the naming because what is occurring is the idea of an idea that is within the unconsciousness of the channel. Being brought to the conscious awareness as we have shared what is before you in this interaction is a blended energy. One aspect or thought of that energy is an individual you would label best job and this is a designation and the reparential name that we have used till now. There is another energy within the blending of this interaction which is also another male individual from the same planet that I come from. That is the name of the planet and that will be shall we say the main individual that will communicate through this channel beginning in the January of your next year. For now for specific reasons I best show will remain for the next few weeks more actively engaged and involved in these interactions but then again in the first of your year we will receive entirely. As we have also shared individuals upon our planet are tell and passing. We have no names for say and simply recognize the signature vibration the shall we say soul to soul identification between each individual and simply have no name vocalized representations of these identification. We simply know literally an individual for who and what they are for their relationships of ideas to us and to the whole of our society. However upon your planet you do have language and you do have names to enable you in that sense to interact with each other until you begin to unfold and develop your telepathic abilities which by bit is occurring. Therefore my Bashar name is not really Bashar but upon your planet that will do. The time has now come to in that sense provide a reference for the other individual in these interactions that we have simply labeled the other and the timing is no accident. The name that has been chosen unconsciously on the part of the channel quite consciously from our perspective is an interesting idea in another cell for it is shall we say one of the few words common to your language shall we say more than one of the languages upon your planet. And common to a word in our ancient language because before we were telepathic we did have a representational language. Therefore the name we are about to provide is shall we say a common word so to speak. We will for the purposes of identification upon your planet use your spelling. Therefore allow us to now proceed and share with you the name of the other entity for your purposes for your convenience as that name is. Allah E L A N. What we can share from our perspective is that that name in your language means many things we will allow you to look it up so you can have some fun at home. But the idea is that we will share that one of the meanings is eagerness for action, spirit, coincidentally it is also a word that relates to the heritage of the channel. And in that particular language means tree. We will get into that at another time. Lastly before we begin to interact with you allow us to also share the meaning of that particular reference as it applies to our remnant language in which it would translate as one that represents the whole in a sense you can say though it is shall we say more of a synonym than an actual definition. A alograss. Therefore from this point forward we simply request for the purposes of accuracy that these interactions again until your January 1992 year being labeled from this point forward and in fact you can say retroactively to the session label. Thank you. Thank you. Add Bashar slash a lot. Still kept my name in the front. But the idea is it will be out of there altogether. Therefore allow us now to thank you. When in that sense you are interacting with us at this time you may use either reference it does not matter. It will still be as a whole a blended energy. The last few introductions, introductory statements to these interactions have more or less solely been rendered by Allah. This particular interaction this particular introduction is quite an equal co-creation of the both. Allow us to thank you for your willingness to continue to co-create these interactions with us. We understand that this provides a service to your society but never forget that it as well provides the service to us. For it allows us to relish the many many different ways the many many expressions of all that is throughout the multiverse. What you consider upon your climate to be a repetitive question. Oh there goes that question again. From our perspective is always a little and we are never tired or bored and never get the sense that you are not getting it. For there is nothing from our perspective that you need get you already contained it all and we are simply a reflective service for you to see the life, the brilliance of your own center. Therefore allow us now to proceed to the equal interaction and again thank you and express our unconditional love and appreciation for your willingness to participate in these interactions. Shaitan. Yes. Greetings. Hi. Welcome and what I wanted to say to Bjari because I expect this will be the last time I will have an opportunity. Actually it won't be. Thank you. Thank you. I wanted to thank you for your assistance in the six months that we have been interacting together on a variety of levels. You will always be with me and I realize how I will always be able to contact you and I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciated you being a mirror to allow me to remember that which I have forgotten. And we thank you as well and also point out that it is no accident that you are in communication with the specific aspect of my our being that you are. And there is much in the transformation within these interactions that will unfold in future dates that you will find at satisfied and as reported. And again allow us to thank you for recognizing that you can take it first and if you did not you would simply see the channels mouth moving and with your no words coming out. So therefore anything that you have quote on quote gotten from these interactions we simply thank you for containing it to begin with. You're welcome. And we thank you. Sure. Hello. Thank you. Welcome. As you hear, great. As my birthday is 11-11 I would like if you could expand a little bit on the 11-11 Solar situation and essentially. The idea is that there are many differing representations of this particular gate. There are many such gateways that have occurred in your recent past that are occurring now. And in this particular frame of time what you label 11-11 is indicative of a particular gate. It is a gate of conductivity. And what this means is two things. First of all, it will be quite conducive once passing through that particular time span which incidentally is a time span. Though it may be represented by some at a particular date it is a frame of time. And once you do you will find it to be even that much more conducive, conductive in that sense, to do the things that are truly representative of who you are. The things that excite you the most with integrity. However, the other aspect of that gate as well will be finding it in that sense. All the more difficult to sustain reality which are not truly representative of who you deem yourself to be in your heart of hearts. So therefore when following your excitement things will seem to culminate and come together and in that sense manifest most quickly. When doing things that are not representative of who you are for whatever reason you will just as quickly find them to fall apart. Therefore the gate in that sense ultimately will be what you make of it. We simply suggest that again there are no shoulds but we simply suggest beginning to at least look at what truly excites you with integrity. And beginning to move with that at the present. Beginning to move utilizing what truly moves you at a criteria. Does that answer the question? Thank you very much. As soon as you as well. Shay. Thank you. First I'd like to thank you both for being here and in particular I'd like to thank the show because I'm most familiar with him and I send you both a lot of love and I'm really happy you're here. I'm happy to be here. Thank you for being there as well. I have a few questions that came up in relation to what you just said. In the past I've heard or been told that if you're trying to do something I know I'm using a lot of words here that I'm just going to put it out. Oh, simply put it in. Thank you. If you're intending to do something and you come up against a lot of conflicts that it's a challenge through which you are sharpening and strengthening yourself and in the process of overcoming it or enduring through that regardless of the difficulty that you are strengthening and evolving that way. Now, according to what I just understood that you said how things are going to be changing and are in the process currently where if difficulty, if you want to be doing something and you have difficulty are you then saying perhaps the best thing is to just let it go because that's an indication that it's not in alignment with your highest good and your evolution and your true essence. In a sense, but the idea again allow us to remind you that there are two, probably more, but for the purposes of this, two concepts of excitement of which we speak. That being the overall most exciting thing and in every given moment from the choices available from what you can do, not from what you can in that moment, choosing what excites you. If you find something to be quite difficult in that sense, either you are not choosing from what is available, the thing that truly excites you and moving out of some self-imposed set of obligation. Or you are simply defining and labeling something that is quite a service to you as extraneous and again that closes your vision to be able to see why you created it. Does this help? If not, can you ask another question? Thank you. So then if you endeavor to do something and are having a lot of difficulty and resistance or conflict in getting it, it's not coming, it's not happening, it's a struggle. And then perhaps you are fixating upon choosing from what is not immediately available. Again, the most exciting thing, if you cannot do anything about it right now, the quickest way, paradoxically to get there, so to speak, is to do from what is available, what excites you. And then you may seem in that sense to have nothing what is right in front of you to do with the most exciting thing. But the fact that it excites you is your indication that it does. For all things that excite you are all part of one excitement, one definition of who you are. And even if they do not seem situationally circumstantially to be linearly related, they are. And then you are stepping stones and though one stone may not lead directly to the next, it's still in that sense, is most conducive to step upon that stone to eventually get to the stone down the way. Is that clear? Yes, thank you. And therefore if you find difficulty to understand that it is not tiring to do what excites you. It is not effortful to do the things that are representative of who you are. If you are experiencing fatigue, if you are experiencing even pain, mental, emotional or physical, it is from the resistance of your ecstasy. Resisting from what is available doing what excites you. That is very tiring and laborious. Okay, thank you. Also I wanted to ask, there is for whatever reason, I have been very interested in concerned about the acceleration of the proliferation of radioactivity through man-made nuclear industry. And from what I have understood, it seems to be rapidly spreading into our society and the planet. And I am wondering whether there is a relationship because it seems to me that there is between the landing at Roswell and the 40s and then the splitting of the atom around that time also in the development of that technology and perhaps accelerated present day consciousness of eating and interaction. There is a relationship for the timing and the coming of that knowledge upon your planet. However, there need not be, unless you desire, a fixation at this point upon that, for that does not allow you to continue to be who you are. And if you are constantly concerned about being poisoned in that sense, first of all, allow us to explain that your planet in and of itself has more of the ability to absorb and transform many of these ideas than your scientists currently understand. And there is more, shall we say, space for it to diffuse out into them, perhaps you believe. But also we do sense the idea of particular upcoming invention that will allow you in that sense to store that waste in a particular fashion through which it will filter out. In a sense, the more harmful aspects, the more harmful radioactive aspects of that waste, thereby creating another more, shall we say, less malevolent style of waste. But the idea is where you choose to fix your attention. If there is something that you can do about it, go right ahead. If there is nothing that you can immediately do simply in that sense be conscious to not be part of any of the addition of these ideas, and you will not attract yourselves if you again are not obsessed with the idea to an area that might be quote unquote dangerous. But overall, there is far more of the, shall we say, absorbed in the ability of your planet to a particular point which we do not perceive that you will exceed, and you are in that sense safe and sound. Could you tell us what the relationship is between the occurrence of that and the interaction on this planet at that time? In a sense, it is more the idea of that particular point being the point from which your planet began to link itself up, so to speak, to be able to form a network of communication. For our interactions with your civilizations, our respective civilizations will be when you are unitized to the point to be able to at least map consciousness why being the inviting mode. We are not invasive and will not calm down without an invitation. So it is more the idea of the entire spectrum of technology taking a turn at or about that point that will allow you to be globally unified enough for often that sense to eventually invite you as full members of the association of worlds. In other words, the potential, the threat of it is something that we unified. How would the radioactivity unify it? Well, that is not so much of the focus. There was that concern to some degree because total nuclear annihilation of your planet could result in, shall we say, ripping through the fabric of other dimensions and the idea of it getting out of your own backyard into the backyards of others was of concern to us, but it is most strongly our understanding from this point forward that there have been a map consciousness decision to simply not blow yourself up by those means so that it is no longer in that sense loosely speaking a concern about ours. Okay, and one last question. Simply, if I am learning about changing it, could you tell me how to change? Well, the idea is you are always changing. Change is the only constant and you cannot force change for simply natural. You are willing to allow simply allow the natural flow of change. Where the confusion sometimes arises is the idea is that you do not force things to change. You force them to seem to remain the same. And the mechanism for promoting change is not forcing or making yourself change, but allowing the natural mechanism of change to simply progress. Did that translate? I think so. And again, utilizing all your creations, particularly again to tie it back, the ones you label extraneous because the fact that you are labeling them, extraneous means you are not using them to your advantage. And therefore, you seem to hang up at those points. But you can always utilize any situation that you have been willing to label negative. For us, we have shared all situations are fundamentally neutral. You supply the meaning and the meaning you assign determines the effect you get back. Therefore, why in a given situation would you choose to label something neutral negative? And that allows you to trace back to your beliefs. When you own the beliefs that you have, you can change them. You have perpetuated the beliefs that you have created because once you believe them, you then create the corresponding emotion. You feel like a person would feel who believes that. You then think and your thought patterns are structured according to those feelings in that belief. The final M product is you then act like a person that has that original belief. When you understand and own that you have a belief that you do not prefer, you simply would formulate in your mind the new belief. Allow yourself to feel through your imagination, the tool of your imagination, how a person with a new belief would feel. You will find it quite simple. Your imagination is very good at that. You will then begin to see how a person thinks who has the new belief and by utilizing your imagination still further and picturing how a person with the new belief would act would do, would handle each situation. Your willingness to simply then act that way set up the vibration in the physical reality that allows you to now be a person who acts as though you have the new belief and then you create the new reality through the same mechanism through which you created the old. Does that make sense? Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you, as well. Sure, sure, sure, I have a belief that I don't want to have and it's something very neutral, I'm sure, but maybe you and Alon can walk me through it. Maybe. Alright, this is the belief I don't want to have. In the last few days, someone wrapped all my jewelry and it's like really precious, it's a mistake, it's a lot of it. I don't want to have a negative belief on that. Alright. How could I let go of the little bit of negativity I feel on that and transform it? Alright, perhaps we can begin by defining that little bit of negativity. Can you define it? Yes, it sounds like this. It's like when I walk in the mood, I realize this is starting. And I just stood there, what came to me was that I didn't even have to do this, but I wanted it. And the negativity was she was in the thrill. I said, this other entity was right here in my bedroom. That was part of the negativity, the second negativity was I will never have these price-free pieces of jewelry down again, someone else has not spent time without just enjoying it. And I tried to say, well, maybe they need to go to the house. Maybe they need to go more than I would. But I attached so much hearing to a few of those pieces that were taken. That I shouldn't be too... Maybe you could use directions on how to let go of that negative thing. Or do you perceive overall that you are pleased with the manifestation of abundance in your life? Or do you feel on some level that there are, perhaps, not enough? Yes, I do feel that there is not enough, but not for me. I feel you're not enough for my children. Oh, we need for you at this point. Oh, for me, yes. Yes, what? Yes, for sure. Oh, yes, best y'all. Yes, for sure. I do really have to meet. Oh, do you also understand one of the things we have shared? That abundance is a flow. Not money. It's a paper in a room, but a flow that that symbol allows you to do. Yes. Oh, our strongest sensing in this particular instance is that you have unconsciously, by the way, created a void to allow more flow. Now, before we proceed, does this ring with you? Well, I think in my first room I lost half too, right? Half, if this was just the topic that I would really be in it over my head. How so? Well, if the negative law of consciousness would be so much cognitive stuff around the animal, it would be like this would not have been. Oh. It's not only that, and my cat maxed yesterday. I'd never think that of a house that I wore a concert, now that's another magnitude I'd wear a max before. For now, our sensing in that sense, just to simply put this aside, is max, will return. But the idea of the void is simply this. To whatever degree, for whatever reason, an individual creates a particular void of this style. That void will be filled with exactly the same, shall we say, quote unquote, value of quote unquote stuff. So the idea is that you can truly look at it as being that positive. The degree of what you consider to be lost and the value of what was quote unquote lost will be the value of what you now attract inward in a proportional manner. Did that translate? Yes. So the idea is keep your eyes out. For you will see an opportunity that will allow you to manifest proportionally speaking now that there is a vacuum in that sense that you have created in your abundance for it to be filled with equal or greater value. Mr. O, you understand? I felt this. Thank you, Mr. Sharp. Have another cat question. Oh. This is other cat came to my eyes and she was like six months old and she was pregnant. She had five kids and then five weeks old. And now I'm having a feeling of how do you separate a mother from her kids? Is it probably to separate from each other? What are you supposed to do? Well, the idea is you did not do the separating. The kidding? Well, I know that they're getting bigger now. I need to give them away. They can feel the mothers. They're just heartless. That's a good one. The idea is the longer they are apart, the length of an identification there will be. And as far as you are concerned, what would be new view in that sense is to simply decide if it excites you to interact with those animals. And if it does, go right ahead. Be sure, does the mother's cat got hurt when you take the date? In the way that you mean? Yeah. Not really. I know that she ever see one that's been short of long. It is short lived. Really? Yes. Thank you, Sean. And to you. Is that all? I have some more, but I'll get you later. Oh. And we thank you as well. Sure. Shah, there are many stories of aliens on this planet who are interacting with our government people. Mostly in a negative way. I was wondering if you could have found on that where it's going and it's true. Our particular perspective is that much of the negative interpretation is the product of misinformation by the government or shall we say. Particular factions within it. It is not consensually agreed upon in many individuals if finding out would not in that sense condone it. The idea being that there is the notion that there are particular alien bases underground upon the planet as an example and from our perspective, bases there are, though they be inhabited by human, not aliens in that sense. And there is a particular interest in keeping them a secret and in that sense somewhat mysterious. Is there a particular shall we say event that you are interested in discussing? Well, are these bases then being used to develop extraterrestrial vehicles? No, not really. What you would consider to be terrestrial ideas. Somewhat influenced by certain extraterrestrial, all right, stumbling but not from direct infusion from an extraterrestrial source to individuals upon your planet. Does our government have now have the means or a ship that can propel itself the same way your ship's been? More highly developed than you are being made aware of but not nearly to the shall we say degree of our particular cross and they are finding their usage to be quite limited for the idea is all traveling in space and time is traveling within. And they are in that sense assuming a very nuts and bolts attitude and not factoring in from our perspective the actual aspect that allows these types of manifestations consciousness. Therefore there is a missing link in that way. Are there any alien groups interacting with our government negative or positive? Are they directly on a regular basis? Not really. Individuals at particular factions of individuals have interacted at specific timing which we will not get too specific about and simply were made aware of certain ideas. Now for instance one of the ideas was that were you to decide and this is shall we say the one exception that we have to the non-interference directive. Were you to decide to annihilate your planet by nuclear means your devices simply would not work. Therefore they are well aware of that and the actions shall we say that are occurring right now from our perspective are indicative of that awareness the cutting back in that sense. Rosie are there plans for extraterrestrials to make themselves generally known on the planet. And therefore what you will find within this decade of your time of the at a time at a comfortable rate will be the dissemination of the awareness of the society in a slow way that allows individuals to acclimate to the idea. Then once there is enough of a consensus then there will be shall we say the allowance from your end to invite but there will never be an invading idea and if there were perhaps we can put it this way. Why would we have waited for you to develop weapon routes which could be quite dangerous. It was simply never our intentions to invade in this way and work we would have simply done it a long time ago. Where does the actual physical technological communication is far more of a nuance of a particular style of exploration of what you would label polarity. We just returned from Sedona, Arizona. Oh how excited. And my girlfriend there at Bellrock pretty regularly interacts or can see a desate of reticulum but they seem not to be in a three dimensional form. They are shall we say perhaps a bit of a misnomer but the Frawdee planar with the ability to interact on your level but in general doing so and shall we say it's slightly out of sync way with your normal reality which gives the appearance of an etheric shall we say physicality or what you might label a dream like atmosphere to the interactions. One moment. There's one in particular that seems to want to communicate through her power and she's had some information that she was temporarily detained and has alien or offspring as a result of these detainments. If she find it that these communications are imposed upon her or inviting her to participate if she wishes from this point forward. Only on invitation. Oh I understand. This is what you will begin to see more and more in your society with those style of interactions with what you label Zeta. Many of you your individuals may be familiar with this particular interaction through a piece of literature upon your planet call communion and the idea is that that phase of the interaction for the most part. There are some exceptions whereby individuals are seemingly and we are strongly accessing seemingly taken against their will and they are not abducted simply temporarily detained will seem now to disappear and they will now be in enlistment of the willingness consciously of the individuals involved and that is an example of it. And this is part of again the fact that even that civilization actually has a positive intention. Though it is sometimes misinterpreted by many individuals for particular reasons sometimes simply a misunderstanding and other times purposeful distortion for shall we say other reasons. Are they able to full time it seems that when she was with them the time seemed to be greatly distorted. It is not so much the ability to full time as to allow individuals to meet them halfway and the definition of the time stream in that halfway space so to speak is a bit different. There is a relativity involved in simply again slightly out of sync with your particular time stream and the idea is that many many civilizations each exist within their own discrete time stream. Time streams that are different do not physically percieve each other. There is the ability to alter time stream and there must be a synchronization in order for there to be a discrete physical communication and there are also midway points in between direct and complete synchronization where both seem slightly off phase to each other. But our civilization as well and one of the reasons that you cannot physically perseme our star with your eyes or telescope the recently sometimes speak of it being out of your dimension is that our particular time stream manifests at a different rate than yours. And where we do a scribe a particular label it would be approximately 10 times faster than yours. Therefore when we are each in our germane time stream we are not perceptible to each other. We however have understood that space and time are properties of objects themselves not that objects reside in space and time. And once we have begin to alter, distort and purposefully change the vibration of this we have been able to loosely speaking transcend both. In that regard as Sedona more conducive for this type of interaction because when she comes back to New York City it's much much more difficult for her to perceive this entity. Yes for two reasons first of all it contains what you label a vortex which is a particular electromagnetic focus upon your planet. They are at several locations and would correspond loosely to your planet as your physical chakras would correspond to your body. And that is one reason the other reason is the remote location of it for in general society choosing to remain out of the mass conscious perception will generally shall we say visit so to speak in remote areas. Thank you very much. And to you as well. In a sense you might say that though from my perspective at this moment not right now. Will you be you will be leaving our current earth in the near future will you be interacting with alternative earth so they move to a level of consciousness that you then move on what determines your timing for departure and interaction or introduction of another entity. First of all not necessarily there are parallel earth that we will never interact with altogether. Second of all understand that though I received from this particular channel at the beginning of your upcoming year I will continue to channel through three other individuals upon the planet at this time. So therefore I will not be receiving from your earth altogether but this is the timing for very specific reasons for the initiation of a different and new so to speak nuance of energy from our stream which is represented by a lot. Are there other distinct energies from your stream being channeled currently on the planet. Yes. Only to the degree that the physical channel is aware of them and again at this moment we can name but a few. One is Daryl Aika the initially a tour of the channeling of our energy upon this planet in this particular parallel earth. Also I have code which you may loosely say it is female counterpart residing in the Japan area and then the dolphin dreamer. There are shall we say a few other ancillary individuals through which we are working in this fashion allowing them to climb a tide to our energy to then allow other individuals both from our planet in some instances and from other realms and others to be able to keep their original agreement. One other. We may now identify that there is an individual in your New Zealand area undergoing a similar idea to this. There is an individual from time to time in your LA area other than Daryl. There is a female individual who infrequently relays our energy in your Arizona area. And for now because of the timing of their particular exploration that is all we can share. I have another question. As entities move. One moment there is also a female in your California area that channels animal due to a sea. As we move through third to fourth and we eventually move the fifths we are talking about density and consciousness. Are there entities in fourth dimension or density do they hold onto the same negativity or is the negativity released as you raise your vibration. In a sense released by definition for the idea of the expansion, integration would be the manifestation of the positive of the integrative by definition. Therefore ideas like judgment which are separation of ideas will keep you firmly anchored in third. And by definition you will transform those ideas before you will in that sense begin to partake of fourths. Fourth is a limited version of physicality and by definition you will only reach loosely speaking that stage when you are willing to let go of your actions that keep you anchored in third. One of the reasons for the question is in our movies and TVs we tend to astound the belief that beings as they evolve can turn to, if you would talk about it as a dark side, and misuse the information and capacities that they achieve as their consciousness is expanded. But the idea of any misuse would never come from an integrated being who understood their wholeness and ability to create their own reality without needing to harm themselves or others with integrity. So the idea is that frame of mind that approach in and of itself on some level is indicative of an individual who feels again not always consciously but helpless and needing therefore to make things happen, force things to conform rather than simply allowing through their natural creativity to their natural creativity. So as we raise our vibration through fourth and fifth we are actually simultaneously becoming more integrated by definition. Thank you. Add to you. I have a question. All right. I am interested in toning. Can you comment on what role it will play in the healing process of a healer? Well simply that will be quite individual for individuals. Shall we say interpretation of what it's supposed to do? That all healing is done by the individual in that sense you created all the disease, so normally that or shall we say usually that is an unconscious creation, but the idea is no less created by the individual. And so is the allowance of the restoration of health, so therefore it will always depend upon the belief systems, but that particular style of communication can pierce through many belief systems. Individuals will allow it to be a conducive atmosphere through which and listen to the wording, they themselves allow the shattering of particular ideas which they will only allow to transform with that abrupt of an approach. Does that make sense? Yes, very much so. It also sounds quite nice. And in a sense is approaching the idea of a more, and again I mean this quite globally, universal language. I had another thing in that same area and it has to do with particularly now that I am seem to be manifested and drawing like geometry. Oh, how exciting. And I don't exactly know which way to go with it, but I'm probably my intuition. That is the way to go. Oh. It will allow it to unfold and you will begin to emotionally, not analytically, necessarily, but emotionally begin to absorb and literally channel information from those very manifestations. That's the way I feel. You just confirmed it. Thank you very much. For confirming it yourself. For again, you all contain the answer to any of the questions that you in that sense are offering. For if you did not, when I gave the answer and you say, that's right, how did you know? Therefore you already contained it. And with thank you for containing it. Thank you very much. Please. Oh, perfectly. Thank you. Oh, what a voice. Oh, what a voice. Oh, what a voice. Last time I spoke with you physically, I mean, when we were both together in the same room, we, you had told me the last thing you said was, okay, tell them home. Oh, little show. And that night I went to the beach where I lived. I lived here for each and tell them home. And it was a wonderful experience. Quite a long distance call. Was it done? Oh, well. And fortunately, there is no billing system. I come home, but as I confronted some fear about being alone on the beach and went through the fear. Confronted. Confronted. I, I allowed myself to understand what the fear was about and proceeded to transform fear into excitement. And allowed myself to walk out on the beach. And it ended up, my first step onto the real beach, I stepped on phosphorus. I'm sorry, familiar with phosphorus. We understand the culture. And it was really, it was a wonderful experience. Very exciting because as I walked around the beach and got the, it would illuminate where my steps were. And it was magical. And I told home. And it was really fun. And I called you to experience this with you. And so I'd like to share things with you. Feel like that. That feel good, like that. From our planet. How we signed you. And so that was one thing I wanted to ask you was quite a few times I've gone to the same place and had the phosphorus be there. And the stars and my tones and the rope and the sand. The signs to attract you to experience what I experienced there on the planet. Are you able to, through telepathy and through my imagination experience that? Oh yes. Great. And also Allah wa sineh sense to its one moment explained. That although there is one explanation that these phosphorus are organisms in your sea upon your planet. They are symbolic of the light within you emerging from the depths. And the idea that you illuminate your own footsteps. Your footsteps, your walking in and of itself is the path. Not that there is some path that you must follow. Therefore thank you for being willing to walk your talk. And walk your tones. Well that night I dreamt that one night I dreamt that after I intuitively heard on the beach to be a hole in the sand and put my hand in the sand in the hole in the phosphorus. That night after that I dreamt that I was looking at my hand and the sparks of light were beaming kind of out of them. Oh that it goes. They were inside my hand so that it explains that it was quite real. Oh right. They are always in that sense emerging from your hands. You simply allowed yourself to proceed. Right. So that was a lot of time. We think so. And we thank you very much. Shh. Shh. Speaking of dreams, I had interesting dream last night. Oh right. Do shit. Being in a car in some foreign city, driving it at the engine begins to stall and that's how I was running kind of rough. Maybe there's a spaceship around. Oh how excited. I looked up and there was quite a large disk in the air and many people were observing it. And sometimes by the way when our spacecraft run a little rough we assume there must be a car nearby. I don't know. I'm going to proceed to home a day to be another crash rectangular in shape. Probably three times as long as the tractor trailer. Maybe twice as tall and as wide as the tractor trailer. Very low over the streets of this city. Making a lot of noise, the hissing and whirling noise. Very intense. A lot of energy coming from it. And many people were observing this. They're not panicking but just observing this phenomena. And it was very vivid and real. I was one to know about the dream specifically but also I woke up. I woke up into another dream where I was sleeping somewhere else. That nothing to do with where I live. It was like an alternate dream that I woke up into. Or and then you woke up into this alternate dream. The idea is from our perspective that you may consider that to be coming attractions. Something that will happen in the physical? Yes. Okay. Would it also allow us to share that when we first began to interact with your civilization. Our particular civilization which is not likely to be the first civilization that you make physical contact with. There was a longer span of time through which we assumed that we would interact. There are perceptions that it is now possible for us to interact face to face our civilization within the next ten of your years. A bit of a down scale from the original idea. Which means we are accelerating to the point that can happen sooner. Yes. And you will see many changes upon the, shall we say, face of the civilizations upon your planet that will allow such an idea. That's interesting because everybody is observing this with many thousands of people. They didn't seem to accept them. Right. And that will be the criteria by which we decide when and when. For wide scale panic running in the streets, bowing at our leaves is not our idea of why we are here. And in fact until we perceive that will not happen, particularly the bowing. We will not interact. Or we understand we are equal to you. No matter how much higher some individuals may hold us, we are no less equal than you. And we do not hold ourselves up any higher. We are more likely different, more expanded, a slightly different perspective, but absolutely equal. Anything that we, or I can do to help other people understand that and accelerate that. Yes. Be a shining example. Do what excites you the most in any given moment with integrity and individuals will wonder, what does that guy got? I want in and they will approach you. You will attract around you a nucleus of this idea. But each and every individual can only do so by first doing it themselves. Not thinking it, not rolling it around in your mind, not trying to convince other people that your way is better. But by doing it applying and being a living example, there is then no need to convince. You already believe it. It is quite obvious and individuals who will benefit from that will simply find you. And the sooner you do it, the sooner you change within yourself. The sooner you do not prefer the sooner everyone else will seem to have changed. And to some degree you have already witnessed this all the time. Is that all? Yeah, one other question. Oh, fine. Sort of a several part question that you can talk about it whatever you want. Oh, right. I was curious about economic things. A lot of things on the media talks about the economy and sort of in a gloomy way or I'm certain way. And even more specifically in Rhode Island, there's been a lot of problems with the banks and... Transformation. Yeah, a lot of changes going on and a lot of people are unsure of what's going to happen economically. And I was curious how and not to get caught up or influenced by that mass consciousness. Oh, thank you very much. Our simple suggestion would be to create the notion and attract to yourself alternate ideas. Alternate means of exchange with whatever individuals you buy to track it to you and beginning to put into place experientially. Alternate systems so that when the overall large system perhaps stays in abrupt shift, it will not directly seem to affect you for other things will be in place. Does that make sense? Yes, any suggestions on that? On how different systems we could develop already? An idea is being willing to place value upon the service itself. Be willing to equalize the value of services rendered by individuals. In a sense that may be, shall we say, the first bridge toward this idea? To a, shall we say, intermediate conduit in that sense causes an inequality. So begin to equalize what you are willing to accept in exchange for your services. And you will find others doing the same offering you services that perhaps you thought before were worth far more than yours in equal exchange. Oh, because we always put a monetary value on them. That idea will transform. And certain individuals made use to experience it catastrophically. However, the good news is no one has to. Again, as you expand your consciousness, you expand your awareness of positive and negative. For that is true expansion. Awareness of everything expands, but your awareness and your direct experience are two different things. You can be aware of ideas and not need experience them. So again, be willing to again start with the notion and then begin to allow yourself to attract opportunities and act on them to instill alternate systems with whatever way that you are willing to. Whatever way they arise. Okay. And you as well. At this time, we will pause for a short break of 10 to 15 minutes of your counting and resume contact in this fashion at that time.
