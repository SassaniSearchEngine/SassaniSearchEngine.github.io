 We will begin this interaction this evening with the entitlement. You are home. Allow us to explain the following idea. We notice quite often within your society your civilization, a penchant for the notion of going home. Very often this is phrased in the form of a literal escape from the reality that you are in back to perhaps what you may perceive to be a slightly more preferential reality. The idea then arises that there is some home to which you will go and perhaps you are now on some type of field trip. Allow us to begin by expressing simply that as each and every one of you are a discrete individual you will always maintain that individuality. As you begin in that sense to incarnate within the framework of a timeline in your various lives everything around you seems to change. The people seem to change if you create the type of reality that contains them at all. The building, the places around you seem to change. But interestingly enough you will always perceive yourself even though you may think entirely differently and have an entirely different approach to life as the same you. So therefore we have discussed many times that change is the only constant. So even you will constantly be changing but if there is some idea that would seem to have a degree of permanency so to speak it will be that you will still no matter how sleeping these changes may be always perceive yourselves to still be you. A discrete individual. As you begin in that sense to allow yourself to expand into the other dimensions and levels of your being that you will always perceive that everything else is merging into you. The paradox line within the fact that each and every discrete viewpoint will also experience the same thing. For nothing from any perspective is ever lost and most literally only gained. For as in that sense you allow yourself to collect back shall we say portions of yourself that you have expressed externally it will all seem to merge into you. You each and every one of you will perceive this to be happening and this is one of the prime factors one of the prime mopai dimensional ideas within all that is. Each and every one of you creates their own discrete universe. You each expand into that universe. As you expand you seem to contain the very reality that you use to perceive you existed within. So the bottom line is as everything changes there is a portion of yourself that remains the same and that is the only only idea that remains consistent. Even it changes again in its expression but your core level beingness what we have referred to as your signature vibration in a sense although it may become enhanced remains fundamentally the same. Therefore no matter where you ever are no matter where you ever go you are home. Home is not somewhere to escape to you are home. No matter where you ever are ever you bring home with you. We wish to make this very clear for again as you expand into fourth density it will not be from the framework of escaping the miserable third. It will be through the true understanding that you chose this particular style of limitation to be able to maintain focus. Focus in the way that we are defining it for the purposes of this discussion is unique to physical reality. When you are focused it possibly seems as though it would be hard to picture how you would exist in a more diffuse state but exist you will and maintain that individuality you will. But once you understand that you yourself are home then you can never feel in that sense once you understand it in your heart of heart you will never feel out in the dark. By expressing most fully within any reality that you have chosen who you are you ground yourself into the very reality that again you have chosen to be within. So it is not a matter of escaping from here perhaps if anything if you would like to give it a label it is allowing yourself to quote unquote figure out after you've already taken for granted that you've chosen to be here why. Now you can do this in a very hodgepodge manner and have this be quite shall we say random or you can simply trust your heart of heart. Trust your higher selves message to your physical self so to speak. That being your excitement. That is why it excites you we have discussed this many times but the idea is why something moves you why it attracts your attention why it allows you to desire it with all the emotion you can muster is because it is an indication of who you are choosing to be in that particular mode of your being when you realize foundationally speaking that you are home then wherever you go you consciously bring home with you very often in your society you have the statement that home is where the heart lies perhaps that is partially accurate. When we remind you your consciousness is not within your body your body is within your consciousness but from the perspective of this particular focus that particular energy chakra as you call it does allow you to sense or feel the home next within you. So in a sense the warm feeling that you may allow yourself from time to time to experience in the area of your heart is an indication energetically seeking of your connection to your center which is your home. Therefore you can now begin to walk in your endeavors and understand that you are within a reality you have chosen. If you acknowledge that you have chosen it you can begin to give yourself the opportunity to see why you have chosen part of the joy in and of itself of the style of reality whereby you limit your consciousness so you don't know it all is for the discovery itself is for the unrolling the unfurling the unfoldment along a timeline of what you are choosing to explore and as we have also shared when you already know it all nothing is new nothing is learned nothing is discovered and there are no surprises. Therefore part and part of this particular style of physical reality with the imposition of a self forgetfulness is the joy in and of itself of the unfoldment of the discovery and your willingness to simply state through the universe in no uncertain terms I have chosen this reorient your vision to be able to begin to see why you have chosen it and the joy in the discovery that you have chosen to experience not just think about but physically experience this is quite a unique reality in that way understand one other immediate connection that you always have with your home which again as we have described is within is the idea that your home is always expressed in each and every now moment and if you will begin to allow yourself to become grounded to right here right now you can always draw upon the warmth of the heart of your home if you spend your now moment lamenting about a perceived past bumming out about an unpreferred imaginary future you cut off that connection in that moment you are simply not utilizing the moment to its fullest advantage because the things you are projecting either backward along your timeline or forward simply are not available in that moment and by your willingness to place attention upon the past perceived path or the dreaded future in some cases you do not allow yourself to see in any given now moment what's right there you can say that that projection of passing and future in a sense are a particular style of glasses that obscure your near sighted vision and create a seeming far sighted vision but each and every moment contains within it near sighted advantage near sighted opportunity so therefore if you will simply allow yourself to bring yourself back into the moment in a sense you raise those glasses from your eye and you allow your vision to expand to be able to literally see what's right in front of your face what's in every single moment every single here every single mouth is everything you possibly need when you are passing and futureing you do not allow yourself to see it when you do not allow yourself to see it you create the seemingness of being cut off from your source cut off from your very home when you in a sense more consciously decide to simply forget the perceived path and the perceived future thereby again consciously imposing the forgetfulness you begin to remember make part of your club a new member remember what's already right there so allow us to capitalize that home is within wherever you go home follow in your waking daytime dream that you wake up into home is always there in your sleeping nighttime dream that you quote unquote fall asleep into you bring home with you there as well it is within and you can always always reestablish your connection with that home with that center by grounding yourself in any given moment a very simple way to look at it is that follows when you are weighing what is right in front of you in any given moment we have suggested using your excitement as a criteria for all excitement is linked by definition it is all an expression of who you are but allow us now to add the idea that when you are weighing what is immediately available many of you throw into the choices many things that are not immediately available this confuses the issue this takes the attention off of what is immediately available so when you are beginning to view what your choices are in each and every moment allow yourself to choose from what is available in what is not if it crosses your consciousness simply allow it to continue on its merry way when the now moment arrives that you can act upon that particular thing perhaps it will be the most exciting thing of what is available but then you will be choosing in every moment only from what you can act on and not throwing in various ideas that do not conform to your exploration of timing and allowing them to so to speak not you all center pull you out of your very home so this idea of understanding home is within and combining it with understanding that home is in the moment will be most helpful we will proceed with the interaction for there are many questions many discussions many discovery this evening of your time however before we proceed allow us to also mention something else now that you're all right at home we're assuming you are now grounded enough for us to share something with you in the second half of this interaction after what you call your break we will take a little trip we will explain at that time how this will work for you will all stay seated perhaps you will in that sense proceed physically I have gone nowhere but go somewhere you will allow us again before opening up the interaction to simply explain that one of our many mother crafts are directly in your vicinity and and the second half of this interaction we will unmask visit that craft therefore allow us now to once again and for the first time thank you for your willingness to interact with us for your willingness to participate in perfect timing for your willingness to re-discover and establish your home within and for your willingness to stay grounded in the moment so that we can fly therefore in exchange for your willingness to interact and begin to expand into the many levels that you are and also act as ambassador we ask you now how may we be of service to you hey sorry for the past several weeks I've been on an exploration of interacting with extraterrestrials the past several years past several weeks come to point three weeks ago I woke up at five thirty in the morning in bed and breakfast in Scotland in etiquette with a room full of visitors visitors yes they were just scanning they're waiting like they were waiting for me to make the first step how did that feel rather than being dragged off well waking up there is some significance in that allowance by the way there is I realized that that they're allowing me to choose the timing and they're allowing me to choose the degree of interaction at the time my response I was startled now by the way now I'm sorry simply proceed yes now is the timing now things may become more conscious now things may be according to your shall we say conscious will for many things have been worked through to allow you to begin to access the many levels of your conscious life do proceed thank you I've experienced a I've processed her a great deal of fear around this whole phenomenon and I've come to realize that because I keep on focusing back on that actual experience of what actually occurred I realized that it's not them I'm afraid of it was me the me that I saw reflected back that was the fear they looked at me in a way that allowed me to see myself that is very often what will occur in that they are literally mirrors but do you feel I mean I went to the idea that you know these people develop the technology to full-time and space just to come here and scare me perhaps they have better things to do I realized it was the disparity between the distance between who I think I am and who I saw reflected back to me that created the fear by the way as an alternative perhaps viewing yourself as an ambassadore will be a bit more befitting yeah I'm a much more calm ambassador than certain moments to that experience in the past couple weeks well that was part of that process of the coming cleaning out the energy fields yeah being able to see in a sense that when you wish for something perhaps it would be to your advantage to be quite clear because you might get it for sure my question is did anything occur in the past to have did it pass that I misinterpreted to generate this type of unconscious and stored fear allow us to answer in the following way and we will purposefully be vague but the idea is something did happen in the past though we would not phrase it that you had misinterpreted you interpreted it properly for who you were at that point however you are now someone else and the someone else you are becoming and in fact have become is a bit more able in that sense to be able to interpret things according to shall we say a more integrative positive overall idea understanding that you do deserve to function as an ambassadorial very often what we find when interacting with members of your society is one of the primary reasons for invalidations upon themselves by individuals is them merely thinking on some level why would they choose me little old me poor little old me whatever but the idea is it was an agreement on both sides and when you will in that sense understand that you truly do deserve to fulfill your agreement you will hold your head a bit higher and your knee will not shake so much if i in the past had interactions that i don't remember you have that interaction that you are not bringing back as a conscious memory yet and do these involve being a board spacecraft being involved in communications with extra-terrestrials that i wasn't ready to have a conscious recollection of that's the time all in that sense that we will confirm is the communication itself thank you bishar and who's over there sure i have two questions number one the first is you have said before that there are times that we choose things we don't prefer um is it that we do when you're saying that we make choices and sometimes realities and choices that we make are non preferential well the idea is in general when we are speaking of this it is prior to coming to the awareness that you do create your own reality before that awareness occurs you still create it but very often individuals will create a portion of it with what you create and imbue as an unconscious set of beliefs so therefore when you do not realize you're creating it the portion of your creations that come from beliefs that you have not looked at upon the surface and are perhaps non preferential beliefs that you have simply bought into then the result of those styles of creations will be non preferential manifestation when you begin to consciously decide to create the unconscious creations flood to the surface the unconscious beliefs scream for your attention your willingness to acknowledge them and embrace them literally allows you to even make those conscious and the more that you integrate on a conscious level the more you simply then continue to generate consciously through preference so the idea is the un preferential creations in general are the product of unconscious beliefs once you allow them to become conscious and to deliver the message for creating them they can transform and if in the process you are creating consciously and no longer unconsciously it will shall we say work itself out in such a way where you then only experience preferential reality you may be aware of other non preferential realities experienced by others but you only experience preferential also we sometimes speak that before again conscious knowing that you create your own reality arises one of the many ways that people will define themselves and their preferences will be to provide themselves with so many examples of things they do not prefer for the process of elimination but that is the product of unconscious creation does that explain yes and part of my question was it seems that that when you're choosing something you're always choosing based on the highest police system you have operating with your own limits of the ability based with your capacity to express self-love so every choice at the now moment is at the highest level of love that is available and it's only in reflection that we discover that something is no longer preferential because we're now experiencing a higher level of self-love all choices out of preference based on the available energy at the moment not always if you do not know that you are creating your own reality set up what is sometimes labeled as automatic behavior button pushing behavior and so forth so therefore there is the shall we say allowance within the style of how you create your reality sometime not you personally but as a runaway train for many of these ideas to wind up slipping in there unconsciously what we are simply suggesting is now that you are making a conscious balance anything that presents itself as an unpreparential reality that has perhaps resulted from unconscious beliefs at the moment it is presenting itself is the ideal moment for you to look at those beliefs and integrate the most effortless with so now anything that you experience that is non-preparential is within perfect timing an opportunity to flush out so to speak those remaining unconscious beliefs okay now carrying that forward that there are the most exciting things that we want and the most exciting thing that is available at this now moment if all realities simultaneously exist isn't it possible to shift your vibration to allow the experience of that which is the most exciting thing in your reality it is possible but it is not one of shall we say the mass of greed upon definition within the style of reality it is possible and if you truly believe it you can experience it but if you do not experience it you can then assume that you have chosen so to speak to play by all right and agree upon a particular set of rules all right is there a distinction between knowing and belief oh all right my sense is any time you're looking at a belief you're defining even though it might be an expanded it has a limitation because thought once it comes from essence the thought it has formed a belief is a has structure has formed so it inherently doesn't that have a limitation to it we are not sure we understand the question can you rephrase a belief system is it can you have a belief system that in itself by having some structure not have a limitation and still is the distinction between knowing reality versus a belief which there's action versus being oh first of all understand the breakdowns from the primary already first of all there's existence existence simply exists it simply is has no timeline no beginning no ending infinite internal and multidimensional the first distortion from the primary frequency or separation in a sense is pure knowing that the next set of separations are belief emotion and thought so therefore direct pure knowing that is shall we say a downloading of information from what you might label your higher self whereby even though the information may be downloaded in a chunk you simply know an idea there is no interpretation belief in a sense you can say is an interpretation or a choice between many knowing net dead and emphasis in that sense is this clear at all yes it's possible to exist in knowing this oh yes and that is what you will find to begin to present itself within your consciousness as flashes of awareness revelatory flashes if you will when you expand shall we say through the various densities you approach this pure knowing that more and more you can experience it within this reality but once you are experiencing it always within this reality it is literally then a different reality are we getting somewhere oh yes is there something else how all right so when we are at the instant of knowing this there is a beingness associated with the knowingness rather than an action that's associated with the belief system in a sense it is direct so my sense is that when the knowingness occurs that many times the knowingness results in our forming an expanded belief system which is basically a thought that occurs outside of our limited box of beliefs and capacities and our reality all right so we have the ability to expect is it possible for us to exist in knowingness and beingness in third density now now now now now that would be and thank you very much the only less remaining firmly entirely 100% grounded into the moment your beliefs which are limiting the beliefs and knowingness is limit less will again flood to the surface one by one in perfect timing allowing you to address them acknowledge them embrace them and then choose another more limitless belief all right now when at first the living in the moment may be seeming to be a process of cleaning up some old dirty beliefs in a sense okay and existing in that moment choice isn't even required it is flowing with the essence of now and allowance of interaction with the energy rather than choosing a direction and an action well in a sense it is both in physical reality when you speak about that style of flowing you are infringing on the idea of how our civilization exists however there is still a certain joy within physicality in providing many choices in particular in our reality they are all preferential so therefore many things to choose from is one of the options within physicality so there is a flowing neck knowing neck so to speak but then there is the idea of many choices to give yourself shall we say variety thank you very much um we had talked a while on a different now about the forgetting to remember game and are you able to tune into the energy of what occurred today at a different now when that game was manifest in a sense yes though we have forgotten much of what we had remembered simply that as you begin to live in the now moment and lose or shall we say let go of the hold from the past the hold from the future that you create and continually exist in the now moment very often you will literally even within your own framework of understanding seem to forget your past for it no longer has that type of significance whereby you use it in a sense as an excuse to hold yourself back once you let it go release it in that way you actually may find that you forget aspects of your past now you can interpret this in any way you wish you can believe you're going senile but the idea is in for density there is simply not the need for that same style of timeline memory so the forgetfulness in and of itself will increase as you live in the moment at the same time what's in that moment will never seem clearer yes so in the existence where you exist there actually is no path the path is created now but that is a reflection of what energies are available now to create a memory to enable you to have a conversation about another now moment perhaps in the sense you can say that but again when we recreate our path we are conscious that we are recreated one moment allow us to proceed to another interaction and then we will come back but there are many available and allow us to share is that okay and we thank you as well shedding over there okay good evening and do you greetings a few tight-print questions I don't know if I dot you just spontaneous well how tired I want to ask what is the mysterious object that is going to zoom close to the earth on the Sunday 5th that our astronomers have reported to the present you can you'll see next question from the playing civilization for it and a paper by the way would you want us to come to your Christmas tree and open your gift for you well thank you very much these were the top particular gift is by air mail okay so Sasha thought that a recent tape about on the neck and we have on the radio we played a tape with Sasha who said that her ship a plating ship had at least thousands of people that are living in when cities in the ship and are heading towards the Mexico to the town of Dalsia and Buddhist called and they will be having an entrance to life with me at that timing uh detail is what it's going to be with government officials and media and what would be the focus of this meeting between these earth people and the quieting of the idea is in this particular instance our strongest sensing is that it will not be with your media will not be with your governmental officials and perhaps is for the benefit of particular individuals who are interested in beginning on many levels to interact with that society your governmental awareness so to speak of extraterrestrial society at this timing officially does not extend to the pliadians yet they are still shall we say in the initial phases of diplomacy uh the show in the line and to all members of the association of worlds in the three federation of plants in a past challenge it was stated that people of earth and unnamed extraterrestrial society would be making the first overtontact for our people my strong sense is again you must be mentioned the pliadians and this correct sensing has a major value too our strongest sensing is that the likelihood of the initial contact between your civilization and another will be with reticulant is there anything we can do tonight to increase the speed of the higher vibrations on planet earth and if we all hold hands would we be blending our mass energy to increase the speed of light coming into the mother earth at this time not to be too obvious but if it excites you yet there is always the idea of a synergy that occurs when many individuals collectively focus their consciousness in concert together the idea of synergy again being that the whole seems to be more than the sum total of the parts what again though on a more obvious level that you can do in any moment is what excites you for by being in that moment the truest representation of who you chose to be you are acknowledging who you are and your vibration in that sense shined on filters at that moment my final question i might have shown this relevant right now but also by holding hands between the channel and all that together could we increase our mental brainways and communication or all of you on the other end of this interaction can we do this now the idea is you could but it would not increase it any more than you already have the ability to increase it other than perhaps being a symbol that individuals would only validate it if such a symbol was provided so literally technically you have just as much ability without such an idea though it is available all the questions i have i just want to i send all my love to all of you in my heart and we thank you as well it is received and returned to each and every one of you we thank you shined yay greetings and he and along and i have a feeling that there's not just a two of you but a whole team is worth tonight perhaps you can say there are a few spectators this evening of your time to allow the facilitation of the interactions who come we're talking about very types of spacecraft i presume that uh... on our own client in our futures there will be different spacecraft and some of those will probably be interested in in this particular period of transformation but how might we distinguish our our own craft so to speak from our own futures from other craft do they have by definition in general we will not be able to distinguish them it is a very perceptive idea and do understand that some portion of what you label to be your ufo are indeed craft from your own future in general they are disc shaped craft in general they're all exceptions but it is shall we say somewhat of a small percentage in terms of being able to identify them perhaps when you have shall we say logged a few hours in interstellar craft identification you will develop that style that particular discernment for now perhaps you can start by simply seeing one one start one moment is that all for now well one other point i believe i figured out that France is farmer energy it's an energy that's individualistic and not all fearful and very expressive very very open perhaps now there was a lot of fear within the duration of the life time you can see many of the results of that fear oh yes i think she was in a sense she made a mistake here there are such things of thinking that her her mother was her home her child or home her home she lost ground historically biographical and then she gave the tower away into others she was totally herself magnificent but at any rate this energy for me means and energy that is very beautiful and expressive i myself feel i'm moving into a public phase of my life in which i in my works will be you know quite open perhaps this is one reason why this energy comes to assist me now well over and perhaps in that sense another reason that it exists is to allow you to play out certain ideas through her without having to actually do it yourself we make reference to the more negative manifestations of her existence it is a siphon in that sense that is all we will share for now and thank you thank you that's perfectly clear to me well thank you that is over there amen amen and to you welcome hot hot hot hot hot hot you no more re-surrender language anyway Wednesday um history and they had about ufos in Belgium that since 1989 they had thousands of guidance that have been documented well not all thousands but many have been documented by the military and the police and their equal out of eat collateral triangles some of them all the ones they showed were and um the they're continuing to this day and i was wondering if they're yours and why are there so many in Belgium the idea is there are many in many places the individuals in that particular area are having a propensity to expand their vision to be able to perceive them they are in a sense many of our classmates they are i have a friend who uh she has a problem that comes on her she does what situation that she has not allowed to transform thank you okay empower her as well she starts to have a lot of thoughts that uh humble over one another it can start she can be written to receive from another one and the voices will suddenly be as if they're speaking about her next so our voice is saying and her allowing herself to utilize these shall we say perspective to establish who it is she is does she agree with them does she not agree with them it gives her the ability to view her belief systems her deserved ability her self love and in a sense again from what we are perceiving much of the difficulty when it is no longer fascinating have much to do with her buying into the perceived invalidation not the invalidation themselves but that on some level she agrees with it therefore this is an opportunity from our perspective to begin to look at many of these ideas many of the beliefs and many of her own particular issues surrounding deserved ability did that translate yeah very much so i think i think that will help her the idea is again as we have said many times use all your creations even that when it happens say thank you thank you even that can assist me how fascinating and begin to look at how it is fascinating if she does not agree in that sense with a particular opinion that she perceives to be rendered from without then that allows her in that sense to strengthen her own deserved ability her own worthiness so if she will view it innocent not patronizingly but as an opportunity to align herself with what she believes what she does and prefer and what she does and choose the preferential you will find that she can literally use even that and then just say no thank you to the things that do not apply do not need to invalidate them scream at them yell at them but simply say all right no thank you and still be polite even to the voices because this helps yeah because she's been listening to your taste i show this will be very helpful all right then perhaps if she hears shall we say voice or a thought that is quite positively reinforcing that would be the representation of our particular stream of consciousness entering into the conference within her therefore lift it up why other questions oh my husband is it has read some of your book the sharp book and he sent us some of the sessions and he's heard if he was a taste and he he's not really excited about it oh he's having a terrible pain in his lower back and he's very excited about finding out what that's about well the idea most immediately are issues of support within him if not literally financially support from his higher self support from the universe and to some degree of reliance on a style of support from you well thank you very much for sure as you like well perhaps this will be helpful we understand he is not excited but if he is to simply project from his consciousness with his eyes closed in a relaxed state a bubble of blue white electromagnetic fluid around the area in question the low back pain as you said and allow that particular area to diffuse into the blue white electromagnetic bubble and then simply pop it perhaps that will be simple enough if not he will attract something else perhaps a doctor thank you and to you as well if from where we're very little you have said many times and we express to you how much love we feel coming from you that you are just mirroring what's inside of ourselves oh yes from our feelings they come first we create a reality through our thoughts right in a sense you create them from your beliefs emotions corresponding thoughts which then have you perform particular actions you cannot truly say it is just from one it is the whole bunch but the actions from the thought the actions that are taken having those thoughts as a premise is more literally what creates the reality so therefore you can think anything that you wish you can explore anything that you wish positive negative but when you act that is when it is most helpful to have your positive intention in your thoughts sometimes our first meeting someone doesn't make any difference what age they are and I'm feeling very positive and good about myself I get a very strong anger or angry feeling back from the other person am I just really angry inside and don't know it and they're reflecting what I am or to some degree can you describe a bit more precisely the reaction you are getting in and under which circumstances they all come in yes one in particular there was a we're had some landscaping done at our house and the gentleman who was doing it I was very proud of all the work he was doing and I was very glad that he was doing it and he asked me if I would be willing to teach his daughter piano lessons and I said well call me in the fall and we'll talk about it at which point his wife drove up in the car with a little girl involved that wanted to take the lessons so I went over to the car I've never met these people before and the little girl stuck our head out the window and looked at me and said I hate you I'm not coming to your house you can't make me do anything and I hadn't I was just totally flabbergasted and I wondered who had the thought first and who was mirroring whom in this particular instance there are other connections between you and the little girl in and of itself in that sense there is also the overtones of her being confused about who you were does this occur in other instances however is this an isolated event no there can be other times too when I when I feel really good and then someone you know like well in a group meeting or in our choir rehearsal for instance in church or something and I'll walk in feeling really good and then someone will I don't know it just seems to come out of nowhere and I began to wonder if I was attracting ah we understand the idea is you are attracting in a sense since you are creating the whole scenario anyway opportunity from a self-imposed set of testing in a sense the sincerity of your good feeling in other words if you truly feel as good as you say nothing anyone could say could unjog you could move you from your center mirror to myself and you can literally allow rather than those reflections to bounce very hard off of you to simply pass through you having no effect all right in my dream state then a lot of times I've heard people say in this in these sessions that you can get in touch with your higher self and you can learn things through your dreams and if you set your mind positively when you go to sleep to have good dreams quote I thrive in trying that for the last two weeks oh try well a nightmare is that Kamala are terrible and I'm just wondering you know exactly are perfect nightmare but is that a mirror to myself also well again simply understand within the nightmare as you call it itself that every aspect within that dream is a representation of you so rather than someone chasing you for instance being the emphasis of your interpretation another way to view it is what am I running from within myself simply next time this occurs when you wake up and have a remembrance as you say which is by the way simply an interpretation in physical terms very often of a non physical occurrence so it is not exactly what happened but the idea is substitute the idea that everyone in the dream was you then look at it again from what portion of yourself was doing the perpetrating and which portion of yourself was accepting being victimized in that sense does this make sense yes yes use it all thank you and to you shut it okay um it's the cat healthy um our immediate perception would simply be for your own peace of mind to have her examine she is as we have shared walking in other realities perhaps you just simply chooses to spend a bit more time there her eyes are always turned out to her crown oh i was just letting you stick our perception is no again though we suggest if you feel in that sense so inclined to follow it through and perhaps there will be other occurrences tangentially all together that will arise from your action okay um also you said it's the last interaction that you might expand upon we thank you for remembering and asking is there something else oh again it is yet another opportunity within your particular realm to view and discern between being responsible to and for all i if you say so but until you say no sweat it may seem to keep repeating as a tough one it does not need to be and you will understand the greater service that you actually render by being responsible to rather than for for literally assuming responsibility for another is accepting some portion of their power which is not allowing them to act fully self-empower all right okay I hate to ask this question for money i feel like i'm buying more my true self and doing what excites me more than ever before in my life and financially i like three months in the rear i'm like every bill um and so i i know the rules about manifestation and abundance and i want to know in particular to me um what am i doing to create this black we have two simple suggestions first of all when you speak about doing more of what excites you versus less of what excites you that still implies that you are not always doing what excites you that's the first thing but the second thing again something that we have discussed is the idea that for every every stage that you choose to perform upon there is automatically the perfect audience however if they do not know what time and what day the show is going on no one shows up make yourself know allow people to access your service your unwillingness to in a sense not in the aspect of selling out but advertise your presence is in a sense what seems to be slowing things down individuals are there individuals will co-create service and assistance with you but they cannot find you and to you shouldn't get female than that so when you think the energy came from that first excited view to the thought of communicating on our planet from the choices available upon my planet the choice is well the idea is as far as we create civilizations and some manifestation of a timeline itself i was born into a society where this was already one of the options prior to engaging in these types of interaction and piloting my own spacecraft i was part of a larger crew of a larger craft so the idea is there are always choices available and i always pick the ones that excited me I the choices come from the society that we choose the reality that we choose when you wish in that sense to explore a particular set of choices from the quote unquote oversole level you will then automatically find the particular style of reality that contains those choices that's true those choice of their fear get all the individuals that exist in your planet now all of them are interested in those choices no there is a high degree of individuals interested in extra shall we say as the sonic communication but there are only a certain shall we say number that do so in this particular way and through what you label channeling we are only shall we say communicating with approximately 75 civilizations at this time in this particular style i have another question what happened did we answer the first not entirely if you go back far enough it's what gave why did those choices come into play for your for your people in my particular instance it has always fascinated me to travel back into time and observe the events that enable the existence of my very civilization does that explain a bit better if it comes from your higher being in a sense but it is also the product of my physical embodiment and those particular set of choices another question why happened to all the bees from now that when when it imploded itself or it just integrated itself for the purposes of this discussion shall we simply say most of them incarnated onto earth and the timing for the ending of that civilization coincidentally happens to coincide with the beginning of mankind approximately six million of your years ago thank you beshara and shet sure eight um the last two months i had uh something i thought was kind of funny in a sense i was sitting down at a table in my radio and i'm sitting there next day i feel like i'm not necessarily right there in a sense i'm i felt like the change was happening at 20 minutes with no one this has happened about two or three times the last two months to use plenty of what that is and well first of all what's the funny part well i felt always looking for a good laugh it felt kind of funny uh because i felt like i've never been in earth quite before but it felt like it's still a word in earth like i guess they feel vibrations or movement from where they were sitting or what they were doing i felt that kind of feeling in the sense that i was just for some reason we're very white at the mongolite editor my whole body felt very white for a few seconds and i was back to what i was doing well perhaps then you can use the analogy that in a sense from at least the aspect of your heart chakra you had a heart quake but the idea is that you simply were exploring lightening up loosening up your grip on your particular style of focus allowing yourself to diffuse expand if you will into a bit more of yourself and then contracting in a sense back but now having brought the experience of the expansion back to you there is an extra shall we say portion of now what it is you define yourself to be and so from the inclusion of that expansion there is a feeling of in a sense being anew conscious reality at that moment that i had progressed that quickly in a few seconds well you can do it anytime by simply sitting down and utilizing deep breathing when you do by the way you are in what we consider to be prime conducive frame of mind for telepathic interaction so perhaps next time you are doing it sit down and ask a few questions side to right much and to you shiv do you have or an esosani channeling type sessions like you're doing here in other words do where you channel to us do other people channeled through you it has occurred in our past it is not a current shall we say occurrence when it did occur it occurred primarily from the system you labeled serious there are consciousness round and about that particular trinary by the way star system that in a sense you can say have the relationship to our civilization that we have to you loosely speaking in a sense they represent our future selves do you maintain as we have guides that we call we have our spirit guides and energies or entities that communicate with individuals on the planet do you maintain that type of communication with other entities on a personal basis in a sense yes but shall we say many of the individuals who we communicate with in that style then choose to reincarnate upon the planet and then we physically interact um one last question we spend most of our time asking you questions are there questions that you would like to ask of our group perhaps later on in this interaction and we thank you one moment over there good evening for sure and great I would just like to say thank you for all the wonderful information that you have shared with us and compliment you and your wonderful sense of humor oh thank you very much and we compliment you as well for understanding the joke it's two things number one the prospect that of you sharing with us the ability to see one of your spaceships is for me tremendously exciting then stay tuned one the other thing this is a rather personal question so certainly I respect you to be brief but Klaya came here to see you one night okay and it seems that you and I have a similar interest in that you have and you just been knowing the things that have come before and understanding them could you briefly tell me a little bit about what you discussed with that evening in my past life all we're want to do is the idea is since we shared the idea of pilot with her what have you been able to believe what do you know so far this will allow us to add to the picture if in a sense that will be absurd honest I don't have much recollection of what she told me certain things but I I personally don't have much recollection about that other than I have always for some reason had an interest in things to do with Germany she told me that I guess I was an agent in England during World War II one moment there are many many many connections that come up within the auspices of this particular conversation in that sense it would be more conducive to discuss many of them with you individually the idea simply being and we will as you have also already suggested simplify this greatly is that you did act in that sense in what you would label a covert style but there was all together another connection that had nothing to do literally with your earth this is why we need shall we say some extra time to discuss it perhaps in that sense the opportunity will arrive but the idea is if you can take whatever information you already have and utilize the projection screen of your imagination you will notice your imagination in and of itself to supply many of the details and this is part of your own process which would open up to us many more ideas but again also give you the prerequisites to understand much of what it is that we have to share so therefore being that we did not really answer the question do you have another question only one when you say there was a connection I mean a connection between Claudia and myself as well yes as well I quite understand what you mean it is one of the rare times in which we purposefully need to be nebulous trust us and we will continue this conversation later hold on thank you very much for sure thank you as well yes I'm going to also get a little bit more here too only from the standpoint of time and creating after I talk with you about our connection built in my connection in the last life of that life in the second world war I felt the emotion of it and asked you not to tell me anymore because I wanted to come home and get it this with Bill but he does what did you get well I got an interesting thing of I was a young man he was a young female and we met in Germany and this whole story unfolded and at the same it was fun to do and at the same time I was believing it and also just believing it all right there we did well I mean I I think well we create this and it's fun to create and how much of it is really true and it's it's in fact we just create make up the whole darn thing well each thing that you have shared with us is our perception of what occurs so what more have you gotten though there was a particular end to the process which was the reason we allowed you in that sense to look at much of it how far did you go in that life in viewing a remembrance of that life yet um well how far did we go you were male he was female met in Germany what else people before the war that has separate ideologies I was very democratic and he was very very fosheistic female but we liked each other a lot I mean we became very close friends and lovers and explored the countryside of Germany and then we didn't see each other again I got excited about being a pilot and wanted to go to war and then we met again in England and but I died very shortly thereafter so and I don't know what happened to him her oh buddy you decided you also stay tuned very excited you've done very well and we thank you for your willingness to begin to at least on some level validate your imagination very accurate all of you have visibility it is just that very often you simply invalidate it when you invalidate it you shut off the mechanism when you allow yourself to carry it one step further that is when the truly interesting information comes out at first much of the information does come out in a form that seems most obvious well I already knew that yes that is the path of least resistance that is how lines of communication are initiated through the path of least resistance but when you are willing to validate what you get on that level the stuff you already know then the lines broaden expand then things can slip in so to speak that you don't already seem to know so therefore again we will continue this at a later time at this timing allow us now to pause for a short break so that we may allow you to partake of whatever functions are in that sense normal for your society for we request that at the beginning of the next half of the interaction that you are quite settled down and ready to go and we will return after approximately 10 to 15 minutes of your counting in this fashion
