 Alright, I'll say continue sharing. One moment is the microphone upon the channel live. Alright are you sure? Alright, then I will trust that you know what you're doing. Shitting. Female. From our future in Europe, oh and this is quite expanded than ours. Could you share with us? By the way, not really. But that is how you continue to insist that you create yourself. I simply trust who I am fully 100% in every given moment and that is truly the only difference between what would seem to be my expanded perception. When you begin to trust yourself to that degree, you will have completely the same access to as much of your own self. Do proceed. Okay, so for now, could you be talking mirror and reflect back to us the decision we have made as the conscious, the whole conscious. We have been asked this before and in that sense refrain from answering in that way. For our relationship with your planet is not as direct in terms of being in your future as you imagine. Our time stream is different from your own. When compared to your own since ours moves faster, we would seem to be were you to lie the two time streams next to each other in the future. But in the future or in the date that we consider to be our present, we are still in a different dimension than an earth, a future earth. So our relationship with what you are perceiving to be a future earth does differ from our relationship with your earth as you know it now, but it is still removed from us dimensionally speaking. And so therefore, my perception of earth is not as a singular event, singular planet. I can perceive many different parallel dimensions or parallel expressions of what you consider to be one earth. Because now generally because of our focus and our orientation in polerily aligning ourselves with positive perceptions, what I would perceive as an earth contemporary with my time frame though moving much slower, I would tend to be more aware of positive outcomes. Do you understand? Yes. So therefore, it would be inaccurate to simply say this is how the story ends. No. Proceed. Alright, so speaking, I was thinking of the communities. I understand in the future many people would be living in the communities. And I was wondering and it relates to myself also, how can we live with so many other people and still have room to express who we are and is there going to be conflict? Well, do understand. The idea that you consider city in the way that you now create that will become less and less popular as you say in terms of the fact that there is no population emergency upon your planet. As you imagine, there is simply a very, alright, inequitous use of the land that exists. So therefore, the idea is that more of what you would perhaps consider suburban communities in that sense will arise, more of the idea of smaller communities will arise with rest of an emphasis toward a city though they will still exist. The key here being your ability to communicate globally, which you are now only getting a mere hint of in what you call your computer technology. So therefore, though there will be many communities and they will be spread out around and among your planet to some degree similar to the way it is now, to some degree they will be apportioned differently. Everyone will have the ability to be in touch with everyone else and prior to the point at which your civilization expresses itself telempathically or telepathically as you call it, you will be able to communicate technologically. So that much I can share. I was going to say that I thought we are going towards becoming a telepathic society and I see all these electronic communication that's happening so fast. So are they two different directions to electronically versus telepathically? In my perspective now, for generally when you come up with an idea, the seed of an idea and consciousness, you will begin to form it, form it, form you related into your physical reality using the path of least resistance, that being the tools that are immediately acceptable. So what you call your electronic age is truly a reflection, a mirror of your willingness to expand yourselves as individual consciousness. And because you are more willing to accept that technology will provide such a convenience then you will use that, get the feel for it and it will begin to so to speak. I use the word loosely evolved into more of a telepathic direct knowingness from person to person. But it is my perception should things remain the way they are right now that you will do so first technologically as the initial mirror or reflection for the willingness to expand consciousness. Why? Yes. Okay. That makes sense. I have just one more question that is a bit more personal. Oh, what? I am thinking of going to India and staying there for how long I don't know, but sort of moving there for now. Oh, what? And I was wondering all the information and knowledge and ideas and concepts that I have learned in last few years and I mean from you it's a funny about conscious creative and all that. I was there for four months and I think that or it seemed like they were not useful in that culture and I didn't do anything. I was just absorbing while there. I didn't so to speak, give out anything. I was just taking it in. And if I go and live there, is all that going to be useful or can you say anything? Only to the degree that you are willing to express it as an individual and therefore though it may seem to run against the grain of society, you will be providing a reflection that such an alternative is taught. And it will be up to you to decide whether you feel that is the most conducive atmosphere to continue what you are doing or whether it will simply be a temporary idea and will become quite apparent to you. In other words, it may seem to be impractical for others because it has nothing to do with others, it has to do with you and your willingness to begin to express yourself in the face of the fact that what you call society in this case culture does not necessarily support the possibility that these ideas are accurate and can be useful. So you can provide an alternative reflection, but if the idea is to win over others to see your point of view, you are invalidating their point of view. You are simply being yourself, allowing yourself to be in the company of others, they find you most pleasing, they find you most refreshing, they ask you how do you do this, how are you do this way, that is the way in which you can share yourself and what you know, but only in that way. The idea of perhaps going there and converting others to this type of thinking will very quickly disappoint. Right, I won't go good then, but because I am excited about going, I am thinking if I would merge the two, whatever I have learned here for the last 28 and half years and whatever they have to offer in some of the magic. Well, you can merge it to whatever degree and complexity you wish to draw it out to, but simply remember, no matter where you are, no matter who you are with, no matter when it is, you will always decide, trust and act. And by keeping, as you say, a conscious handle on that, you will always get the effects you design. Are there any or many, what I call, is there any connections living in India the way I am doing my thing? Not so much. There are individuals that perhaps you would say have a certain connection, though they may not be completely aware of what that connection is, but not in such a focused way. They do not necessarily identify themselves in the same linguistic terminology as we do, but there is communication. So in one sense, I would be out of place if I want to keep practising. Now by the way, I did not say that. For making the decision, trusting, acting, being, living your life is simply understanding that you are home, home is not somewhere to go to. And so therefore, if you are there to simply express yourself there, there is no possibility to fail in expressing who you are. It purely depends, most sincerely, why you are going. And if you are going, in that sense, to convert people over to a new point of view, I am suggesting it is my perception, you will be disappointed. If you are going because you see that living this way over there will, in a sense, allow you to be who you are most fully and then allow other people to attract you to them to see that such a thing is possible, that is different. Okay, my question, no, I won't be able, I won't be trying to convert them. My question is how am I going to make you what I have learned for life, whatever number of years, five years? Simply be in touch with who it is you desire to be, decide to be that person, trust that you already are that person and have your actions be consistent with such a person. That is the simplification that we have been discussing the past few interactions of your time. Just to share something, the information that I get from ISSA is not the only information, there are other aspects to who I am, so maybe those aspects will be more active. You are an infinite being. This gives you, shall I say, a lot of lines of communication, but all of them are between you and you. No matter how you separate them, what you call them, what you paint them so that they can reflect a specific aspect of your consciousness, it is still you. So whatever methodology works for you, by all means you. No matter which source you seem to ascribe that something is coming to, decision, trust and action will still occur. And ultimately I remind you that there is no outside source. All anyone can do is say something to you. If it means nothing to you, if you do not feel that you are willing to express that from within, it is meaningless. If you feel that you are willing to express it from within, it is not the other person or source saying anything to you. It is you attracting that idea because it is timely for you, being that idea and getting the results of that idea. So you need not separate it out unless you wish to and find joy in the mere separation as saying, this being helps with this nuance, this being helps with that nuance. You can do that, you can get effects from that, you can create elaborate symbology, but you are still removing your power and accepting influence and inspiration from what you are still labeling to be something that is different or separate from yourself. And ultimately in order to understand anything, you first have to contain it. So anything you hear is not a learning lesson. Perhaps you can call it a reminder. And lastly, can you tell us who you are traveling with today? This evening I am alone upon my craft. Thank you. I thank you as well. Shutting. Hey. See you later. Hi, I am a testimonial to give. Oh, right? Do not need one, but do proceed. I say that because I know it works. Thinking about my former back injury, a couple of days after we had our last session last month, now before you proceed for the benefit of those present, individual have discussed with me the idea of what perhaps you are labeling a chronic pain syndrome. And my simple suggestion was to in that sense address it as occurring in the moment, not being the same pain as yesterday, not occurring from the same source or calls the day before, but it simply being something that is happening right now, isolating it into the now dealing with it, transforming it and allowing it to serve you now. And then that would seem to create a discontinuity in the same way that you seem to create a chronic situation. Do proceed. Well, I chose to believe that it was completely healed and to allow events in my life to flow more rather than resisting and being aware of when the pain would surface, that I was resisting something and thus again realigning, making a decision and trusting it and acting on it. But a couple days after we had the session, I, well actually let me get back to about six months ago, I had started to run. I love running. And with my back in this condition that it was, I ended up going to the doctor, the chiropractor in particular and it being in like really bad shape after running three or four times. Well after listening to your tapes and getting involved with these concepts, by the way, to simply be more precise after deciding to attract a more powerful and self empowering point of view and doing so through whatever means and choosing to act upon what you have reflected upon proceed. I was able to create a heel back where I could run as many times as I wanted without having the back pain come back. And actually today I'm moving and I moved probably about 50 bucks and all kinds of things without any pain in my back. And I just wanted to thank you. Oh, no thank you necessary. Thank yourself. You mean to tell me if it's tough work? Yeah. I had another question regarding. By the way, did you thank yourself? Yes I did. I do many times. Oh well, well let's use the coincidence of language go one step further and pat yourself on the back. I have, I have. With regard to my ability to focus on events in my life, is there anything you can say to help me focus on things like as far as my artwork is concerned? Well simply trusting the incidents of when you feel excited to create in that way an honoring and perhaps you can say conversely when you are not excited about something though perhaps you may wish to do that thing intellectually trusting that the excitement and the lack of excitement is the feedback from yourself to yourself that allows you to be aware of the timing. And if you are willing to honor when you are not excited about doing something and still understand that that thing is still very germane to who you know yourself to be and not judge yourself for not feeling excited about it you will paradoxically find your incidents of being excited about it to rise. When you judge yourself saying I should be excited about this, I am and then you plug in your definition sabotaging myself whatever it is that is the thing that would seem to create a discontinuity. If you say oh well I thought I wish to do this particular artwork but I am not excited about it I am however excited about going for a walk and you go for the walk often you will find you will see something on that walk that will inspire you to be excited about the art if indeed you continue to maintain that threat of excitement about the art. So trust yourself all boils down to that. One more question, I am just really curious as to like and this is quite a diversion from what we were just discussing about why people choose these spurts of people like mass murdering people. Is this something that is like and I presume it is but I am just asking the question is is this something that is allowed when these people choose to vibrate on that level and choose to do such a horrific act. Allowed by whom? Well just the nature of duality and the fact that there. Well obviously the fact that such a circumstance has and does occur allows you to see that it is a wild universally speaking but it is perhaps not the most integrative approach and the idea is invariably again although there will be as many different reasons and rationales as there are individuals participating in that style of reality creation invariably this comes from an absolutely intense feeling of powerlessness and the repeated perhaps I will use the word attempting to prove the power that they truly believe they lack. Violence, physical anger toward an individual conflict arises out of the feeling of powerlessness always never from a feeling of true power for true power by definition is the willingness or incorporates the willingness to grant everyone the same amount of power and not feel the need that your power needs to come from taking someone else's away and so therefore when you simply decide I am already complete no matter what has ever happened to me you are replacing the old decision and you can immediately transform even such an extreme individual but when the idea of the powerlessness is not addressed and that individual does not come to terms with the fact that though they may think they are exercising power they are absolutely expressing powerlessness and frustration that is what will allow them to turn and perhaps see another way did this address the question? I noticed there is a number of weeks coming out dealing with extraterrestrials having a phenomenal moment in the end. One of the movies shows the earth being attacked and all out battle going on between the earth is not desirable from my perspective but nevertheless a drama. Well perhaps I will put it in the following terms that is absolutely not likely to occur and therefore since it is something that you can imagine these outlets give you the opportunity to experience that perhaps you can say one step removed without having to create it in a physical manner. I think it is not as orchestrated as you are assuming that it is more an enterprising idea on the part of individuals. That is my perception. I thank you as well. Is that all? Shut it. You are. No. Me? Why? Okay. Greetings. As of you. I have been talking here about wanting to get more fulfilling work for and helping the world become a more loving and corporate place tonight. It seems like that is coming about so maybe a little faster than I expected. Watch what you asked for you might get. I know. By the way before you proceed is that really possible or you simply selling yourself short in what you understand you can handle. Your reality is never created any faster than you can handle and perhaps the feedback here is allowing you to redefine what you are ready for. Assuming that it is moving at a perfect pace tells you that perhaps you are farther along with your ability to handle it than you had assumed. Congratulations. Thank you. It brings up some fear because what I was doing last year doesn't seem like that's going to show up so I don't have the money from that but other things are manifesting. No, nothing solidified yet. Oh, when you feel the fear or when the fear is as you say coming on do you allow yourself as we have discussed many times to feel that fear fully to allow it to play out rather than linger or have you forgotten that step. You can do it all the time. And when you do and allow the fear to play out. All right. Thank you more. I allowed myself to be afraid. I'm tired of it. Under the next thing then you can realign. One other thing that you can do however. Understand very often in the cases where you are ascribing you are fearful what you actually are is anxious which is simply very excited and not trusting. And simply reminding yourself you have every reason to trust it can shift. Well this summer I'm going to be going working in St. Louis with my Santa with senior executives to help them operate in a more environmentally sustainable manner and this whole new league for me I haven't done that level of consulting yet. Well this is the league that you are now in. I've created yourself in that league and so you have attracted the corresponding set of circumstances to allow you to express that. Very similar to what we were saying about the timing. Your feedback is telling you that you are more than you had assumed you were. Very exciting. So I just got to trust that. Well you don't have to. You can absolutely not trust it and be completely miserable up to you. The idea is it is as simple as simply reminding yourself to trust it. Ah this is much faster than I thought. Oh don't know if I can handle it. Wait a minute. I must be able to handle it. It's here. It's the end of discussion. Time to handle it. And of course as we have mentioned the anticipation can seem to produce anxiety but once you are doing the thing once you are engaged once you are being the person there is no time for fear yes. Yes. You are simply doing it. The experience is fast. So when you feel the fear coming on either allow it to play out if it feels like that degree of fear and real life or if it seems more like anxiety remind yourself of what it is actually exciting. Okay. I wanted to ask a few other things. When I am feeling fear one of the things that I used to respond with that I don't do it as much but I still do it some as compulsive behavior like overeating or being attracted to swimming or something like that and feeling sometimes I felt like I am getting drawn more back into that and a friend the other night suggested that I consider taking pros that I totally recoil. I you know. All right. All right. All right. Stop. Allow it to address the specifics. Each bite that you take is a decision you can change your decision in any given moment it is no more complicated than that. Therefore no matter how it expresses itself simply get back in touch with the fact that you are making decisions trusting them and acting and it simply takes one moment I was about to take one more bite that I really need that is not who I am I trust who I am and the action that corresponds with trusting that is to put this down and do something else and by the way that was the third thing when you feel fear if it does not fall into the other two categories of allowing yourself to feel it or realizing that is the flip side of excitement is the idea of getting going engaging it is the hesitation in the anticipation that is the third reason for the fear simply begin the doing of the thing and you will be engaged in fear will be no more. Can you comment though in general about Prozac I mean the feelings that I have are that it cuts you up from your soul and people that well I don't know it seems to me that you aren't fully connected with your with that definition I would suggest not partaking of it. No I'm not going to. But the idea is that it does depend on what your definition is of what you would expect it to accomplish however no matter what you expected to accomplish it is in a sense you not completely willing to grant yourself power and to some degree saying I must have this external thing to be complete the very act of engaging in that is an act that reflects a decision of not being complete and even in what you call the clinical aspects of your reality it is not my perception that this would be constructed for you in any way. Not for me but just in general some people report greatly improved satisfaction with life on it. All right I understand but we are discussing you here. I'm just asking for as a general question again as many different situations as there are individuals but always will it have the hint of I am not complete and always will you then when you set up such an elaborate scenario create a need for something externally that could supposedly possibly run out. Another thing on your own speed is far more constructive for what it is you have chosen to do. That's how I feel. And remembering if you feel that your behavior is compulsive that that is part of an elaborate decision making process and that you can in any given moment interrupt that tendency and realign to the positive decision. Okay well that's who you are. Okay well that's going to get to my next question. The concept of the super ego I've been looking at that and I know how you say we're all one part or whatever we're all connected. You are 100% the heavier. Even though you often will expand 90% of your energy to make it seem as though you are only using 10%. Well in terms of the concept of the super ego that I've been studying said that as children we kind of pick up cues from our parents that certain portions of ourselves are okay and other portions aren't okay and that we internalize those messages. Before you proceed the mechanism is that you incrementally agree with what you perceive to be their assessment of you which may or may not be their real assessment of this. But the effect that you are now going to put outside of yourself in compartmentalized portions of your consciousness is simply decision agreement is a decision I must be this way mom says I'm this way. I don't like this kind of person who does this mom says I'm this way I must be this way I don't like myself these are all decisions that you perpetuate they are not in a storage bin leaking into your decision making ability they may present themselves as an option they may present themselves as a choice but you are the conscious decision making authority and you need not separated out into a compartment. Well the super ego kind of apparently judges for example I have always I try not to be this way but I find that I have lots of biases and pre-conditioned ideas about certain things and when I see a situation I bring all these judgments to bear which I want to let go of but there's always it seems so much a part of me. It all comes down to the decision that you ultimately make no matter what feedback you are using. There is nothing that is an authoritative voice there are only choices and you can say this is the voice of my childhood ego or you can say this is the choice that the idea of my childhood ego presents and obviously it is not a choice I would make no matter what it seems to say understanding it's all me. You make the decision in each and every given moment either you hold yourself up trust you you are and have that decision be a conscious expression of your knowingness or you use everyone else's rationalization for who you are and still make a decision. Are you getting this? You can only get the negative effect when you fall into agreement when you decide they're right. And in any given moment you can decide and you do not have to make them wrong saying they're wrong you can simply focus on yourself and say no this is who I am. I know me I know my heart no one else can know your heart no one else can know who you are deep down inside unless you have such a relationship to allow them to know and they choose to agree with you. But only you know you. Now let's for a moment that's got you in general terms. Do you desire to express yourself in into great in terms absolutely do you desire to unconditionally love yourself and others yes this tells more about what kind of a person you are than anything you have ever said or done. You know who you are that is all that matters now are you going to have who you present yourself to be who you continue to create yourself to be be consistent with knowing that you have these ideas within you are not I suggest that you do. What you're saying sounds great but that's what I wanted to the question I sit here and I observe you and I see you sitting up straight speaking confidently no matter what anyone says to you you need to respond with no judgment. But do you not understand that you could not even see perceive understand make sense of what you are perceiving to be me doing this unless you contain. And even noticing that I do it means you definitely contain the sense of discernment to see the difference now simply express the difference in yourself which let's not get too far astray from the idea you are already doing to a high degree honor yourself for the degree that you are doing when you seem not to be doing it seems only to realign to who you are. I like get rid of the baggage the self judgments or the fears of what I said isn't good enough for worrying what others are thinking of me. It is not how you get rid of it you can't get rid of it it's always a choice it is how you transform your awareness to have it be irrelevant to who you are which would seem to be the same as getting rid of it but again getting rid of it implies there somewhere to put it and since you're everything there is no place to put anything. However, there is the ability to focus your attention on one thing which makes the opposite thing completely irrelevant to who you are which is perhaps similar to seeming like it doesn't exist for you and so by concentrating on unconditional love judgment is irrelevant judgment is a function of loving yourself with conditions and not meeting those conditions. The judgment springs up as I'm there trying to be unconditionally loved then I remind you it is not a voice it is a choice and that's all you need to remember. I tend to label myself though and I want to get away from doing that when I have the judgment say oh I'm bad or say oh that means you hear the choice you assign it the identity of an authoritative voice then you decide that voice is right but no matter how you color it it's still a choice and you're still buying into it and the only reason you get the effect is the step of the process where you decide it's correct and so therefore my suggestion to keep this absolutely simple is to allow the judgment to invite the judgment challenge it and when it comes up listen to it it's nonsensical it's completely irrelevant to who you are yes perhaps someone could judge that I am this negative way but when I look at the choice of seeing myself as this idiot or seeing myself as the loving unconditional positively aligned integrative person which one will I choose it becomes almost ridiculous when you simply realign to the positive choice for any other choice to have any weight simply reminding yourself that if you go he's right you just made a decision and he is you and the decision maker is you and only when you fall into alignment with the negative choice make that decision trust that decision act that way do you get all the effects you are describing is this getting more clear yes never do you feel a negative thing without making a decision sticking to that decision by trusting it and then acting which in this case generally would be expressed as moping around is it still hanging up anyway this is very important well is this too simple would you like an elaborate process no definitely not I could change that immediately that's what I would choose to do oh what assuming now listen to the wording that both of the ideas I am about to share are true which one do you choose I can be who I desire to be I cannot be who I desire to be which would you choose I can be yours sir oh both are true and I say this to allow you to see the degree of power you have you're going to choose one or the other your mind as well choose the positive thing because if you choose I cannot be who I desire to be that's what you get it is real it is not that you can be the person you want or you can't be the person that you want this is the idea of containing it all you contain both you can't get rid of one and be the other you can focus on one and the other is behind you it's no longer relevant it's not visible and if it swings around you can say oh that's not me I'm over here how would I apply that then to for example compelled to eat it if I'm saying I don't want to I don't want to eat anymore but yet I'm feeling a better strong desire to to eat more oh what how does this dialogue occur within you I assume you have what you call internal dialogue you can certainly use these dialogues to realign yourself how would this go in your mind if you don't mind the asking sure I get a you know I have a and I'm not sure if this is a super ego okay but I have an image of one more let's keep this as simple as possible you're eating your full what happens next well I get not ascribed sources just simply the dialogue well there's okay on the one hand I say I want to be healthy and and the proper way didn't feel good about myself but I know I'll feel good if I don't eat anymore but then on the other hand I'll say this sure tastes good and and you know I'll just get like this feeling that I want to eat it it's almost like a kind of like and I don't care a screw you kind of you know thing like I'm gonna eat it anyway instead of who we are screwing the user all the terminology or in other words assuming we have we'll call them now voices in your head one thing I wish to be healthy my definition of healthy is when I am full I stop eating another one going pardon me but screw you buddy I'm going to eat anyway it tastes good I don't care if I'm unhealthy is this somewhat the dialogue that occurs all right but do understand there is a third consciousness there the you that will choose between these two voices and that you have the benefit of knowing who you are deep down inside so allow the conversation to occur allow the players to come out on the table and then remember these are not voices they're choices which one is more consistent with who I am ah trusting that when I am full it is time to stop eating seems consistent in that it's natural with who I know myself to be well therefore ah this slice of pizza looks pretty good ah I don't need it because it is not consistent with my decision and I can freeze it needed tomorrow do you understand the basic idea idea is to realize there is a third consciousness so to speak using these separations constructively which is the decision maker between the negative and the positive choices and that is the one with the power that is the one who either will pick up the next morsel of food or not but by aligning with the positive self you are not running from the food you are understanding there is a level of satisfaction and feeling satiation that the third voice sometimes get I think can get squelched out by the emotions surrounded by compulsive behavior for example a lot of times if I'm feeling uncomfortable or afraid or sad I'll just that's one of most likely to choose to overeat all right but do understand that you are functioning with the mistaken idea that this third voice can be squelched which I cannot the third voice is simply the one that chooses the third voice is always who you are in any given moment no matter how many choices seem to appear before you the third voice is you perhaps you can say the real you the core you and when you look at your choices next to each other when you compare them that you will always have a tendency to naturally shall I say attract itself to the decision that is more representative of who you choose to be well as we have discussed feel them allow them to play out remind yourself who you are after you have allowed yourself to feel them to some degree we have discussed this before and when you have allowed yourself to feel depression anger fear rather than amplifying you have shared with me it is actually played itself out if you can simply sit still and allow yourself to play that out without performing an action which is one of the things we've been discussing in the past you interactions then you can go through the process of allowing yourself to feel you can go through the process of not squelching yourself but because you are not an action you are not stopping your face is this getting clear so sometimes it comes down to choice between very crying and having a slice of your stuff all right if you wish to say so it would be my suggestion in that instance given the specifics of the situation I may say something else for another individual that the crying would be more a pro quo and that is allowing you to express yourself understand why you feel the way you feel and realign to who you are which simply is a natural eater not a person who doesn't overeat which still has overeat in the definition but a natural eater I eat my body tells me when I am through and I simply because and again it boils down to this as I have said in many different instances and circumstances you trust yourself would you like a cupcake no offense like my sever does not mean you cannot have a snack now and then does not mean you need to section things off so rigid you can enjoy yourself but trust your body conscious that's my fear of the like I'm I'm an alcoholic I quit drinking eight years ago and I was smoking too I couldn't have those once in a while alcohol or tobacco but and sugar I seem to eat compulsively so I'm thinking that I would be well advised to not have sugar but I don't know if that's just as good it isn't that sense just a should and the idea is by denying yourself something which your natural natural is simply trusting yourself and remaining aligned to your conscious decision here we speak with that and you can't go wrong so to speak here could I ask just one more question oh what as a as a budding environmentalist I'm very concerned about what's happening in the global environment and can you just comment that there's so many trends about the environment seems to be getting worse the potential for disease seems to be increasing with reducing effectiveness of antibiotics and you know stuff like Ebola coming up this thing and things like others but do also understand from my perspective these are all effects and not causes what they are effects of is the approach of consciousness and so therefore your understanding that you are whole will begin to attract an outward reflection that will seem to reverse many of the trends that you are simply focusing on because of who you create yourself to be it is not across the board fact what you are saying there are yes it would be who you to get in touch with your environment more strongly but you already to some degree have there has been a consciousness that concerns itself with the idea of being in natural flow with your environment and not against it now I am not suggesting that this is necessarily enough or that you should stop but at least pat yourselves on the back for the idea that this is now an issue as opposed to just completely being glossed over and see the progress as well because it is concentrating on the progress that will assist you in being part of the solution whereas concentrating on the problem simply allows you and I am using your term problem the way that you use it concentrating on the negative outcome has you seeing and attracting reinforcement for the negative outcome I remind you that a problem from my definition is simply a situation that you have not yet allowed to transform and as you begin to perceive that you are no longer polluting your own self physically you will also see a reflective response from your environment as well true on that it is not happening I thank you as well female I have this personal question of cost that I have had for many many months now and I don't know what it is cause was and I don't really know how to get rid of it all right hey perhaps you can help yourself and I can simply be a mirror because this is what you call a personal nature I will address this on most general terms the thing if you will allow me that you are withholding when you are willing to express it that will subside does this make immediate sense I understand what you're saying but I don't know what it is I don't feel as if I'm withholding anything that I go where I want ponder what I have said not that I am using an accusatory tone simply that there is a communication that when you allow yourself some time you will be very aware of that you have not made and upon making that you will not feel the need to keep forcing things out so to speak that is the same all right thanks hey you were talking with Frank about this sort of like addiction to me but oh that would not have been the way I would have chosen to word it but I understand do proceed with his tendency to make decisions in a particular way that is this empowering okay so then but that was the old you can create that appearance by all me at one time I was told I was an alcoholic and I said okay I do everything that an alcoholic does I don't want to be an alcoholic so I said I will never be drunk again I made a decision I will never be drunk again I can still drink I want to have a beer or my last wine but I have never been drunk again now I'm told for the new one never an alcoholic ah how convenient that is how individuals reinforce and support certain notions but my estimation is that what you have done anyone can do now to say every day that you're an alcoholic and I don't want to be ah it doesn't make sense to me that people would do that well that's what creates an individual to be such a thing and where is the focus is the focus on natural living and expression wholeness and feeling good without external sources or is the focus on the disease as it is called very interesting so once you're not an alcoholic you're not always an alcoholic from my particular assessment now but if an individual so defines themselves and make decisions consistent with it you will not convince the mother one and so effectually that is true for them do you see the distinction you cannot talk anyone out of anything you can be a voice that they accept as a choice and should they make that choice they will get that reality now it is very easy to see how these things which are societally labeled perpetuate themselves particularly utilizing that example where part of the treatment so to speak treatment is a constant re-affirmation of the presence of the disease very fascinating and yet it seems to work but only with an underlying tension off one day at a time which is quite a useful by the way approach but in that case it's one day at a time I may slip at any moment off the edge and when I do it's not my fault I have a disease now I honor this as a choice I simply do not choose it myself I've validated as a reality though I say it facetiously I do not criticize or re-rate those who buy into that reality that is their business and it takes quite a bit of power to create such a contracted reality so I honor that power within the individuals that is the strongest attitude you can have toward individuals rather than pity is that old no I have a problem actually what a situation that you have not yet allowed to transport okay all right what situation I'm getting in touch with my anger all right are you letting it out by expressing it to yourself and allowing it to play out or are you physicalizing it in other words deciding in anger trusting in anger and acting in anger far different are those two things why would you say you are to the action statement I would also say that it is the equivalent as to punching yourself in the soul so to speak in the soul in other words any lashing out in anger is simply truly a reflection of being angry with yourself I have some soul searching I have some soul searching that I had two fights today one month it was really terrible I haven't had quite as many years but something I need to learn from this and what did you get out of it? anything else? sometimes old that you will get out of the circumstance is knowing in no uncertain terms that you never wish to do that again that allowing yourself to play it out particularly a disempowered act such as that does not even give you the satisfaction you feel that it will and has absolutely no constructive purpose other than to lower your vibration and match the vibration of the individuals you generally are criticizing why in your estimation did you punch someone what was the physical circumstance briefly what did they do? oh you knew I caught a stealer so you find that stealing is a despicable act okay? oh and so then punching is not a despicable act oh so you stooped down at the same level you were criticizing perhaps not the most effective response now understanding that you found the act of the individual to be negatively aligned to who you are are there other ways that you might be able to express yourself whereby you can still settle the matter and not be the very thing you are criticizing yes oh wow that is where these opportunities if you wish to look at them point you you've done that you've seen that the effect is not who you desire to be therefore next time you do something different now you can concentrate now you can concentrate on judging yourself for having done that though it was a negative act it is over and done and perhaps the only reason that an individual might continue to judge themselves is if they think they would do it again at the drop of a hack but you can let it go and use it as a learning experience I think I was pretty angry at myself for not acting the day I caught it you know I wasn't positive but I had a look at it but before you proceed the anger that I am talking about is deeper in order to be actually lashing out physically at someone there is an anger that you are in that sense directing towards you okay thank you very much thank yourself okay thank you and warn me when you're coming so I conduct only fooling around at this timing allow me to thank you all for your willingness to extend yourself literally as ambassadors of your society and your civilization and interacting with me and members of my society and civilization the feedback that we get from you allows us to learn and know more about ourselves if you are willing to use your own circumstance as positive feedback and reinforcement you can derive as much joy from yourself as we derive from you one last idea is the idea of what you would call the most positively aligned ultimate feedback in the way that you create yourself as physical beings and this is the idea that you refer to as excitement in any given moment from the options that are available one of them stands out most strongly as being the most compelling exciting and passionate choice to make thing to do this is feedback from your reality now that I have decided who I am trust who I am and act according to that person the things that stand out as exciting to me are my feedback that these are the things that these are the things if I am able to do them with integrity which is the knowingness of your place in the oneness of all things that reinforce most strongly your decision as you shift your decision different things will stand out as exciting when your decision is negative something can stand out as exciting that will perhaps seem to be detrimental and acting on it will be following your excitement but not with integrity if you allow yourself to have a positively aligned decision the things that excite you and can be acted on with integrity are a direct reflection of the shortest distance between the two points that you create as the point you are and the point you are going to so to speak so following your excitement and acting on that excitement with integrity from whatever is available is the ultimate positive usage of feedback and trust in who you are on that note I again bid you a most fun and loving good evening.
